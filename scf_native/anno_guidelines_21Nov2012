********************************************************************
1. CHOOSING EXAMPLES

1.1
If a sentence does not contain a valid example of the target word,
ignore the sentence by choosing "0 - IGNORE - Not a valid example."
from the SCF menu.

1.2
Ignore examples where the lemma is a prenominal modifier or part of a
compound.
['call'] I talked with the so called expert.
         => ignore
['work'] I was part of the working poor.
         => ignore

1.3
If the lemma has more than one verbal use in the sentence, choose the
first *verbal* instance.
['work'] I did some work in the garden, and then worked inside the house.
         => annotate the second instance ("worked")
['work'] I was working in the garden, and then worked inside the house.
         => annotate the first instance ("working")

1.4
Ignore examples that are sentence fragments in such a way as to affect
the choice of SCF. Lack of capitalization / punctuation can be a good
guide to this.
['put'] told me to put the thing
        => ignore, clearly a sentence fragment, with arguments missing
['put'] She told me to put the thing in the closet, and then I
        => annotate, as the fragment is in a different clause

1.5
Ignore examples where the sentence is very clearly ungrammatical or
non-native in a way that affects the choice of SCF.
['put'] I put.
        => ignore
['put'] Him and me put something in the room.
        => annotate, despite the non-standard pronouns in the subject


********************************************************************
2. ANNOTATING - GENERAL

2.1
We use the familiar SCF inventory.

2.2 
If you find that you need a new frame, choose a similar one in the
SCF menu, and in the comment field put "new frame XXX" where XXX is
some representation of the frame, approximating the COMLEX names that
are used for the existing inventory.  For example, if you needed two
PPs and an infinitival complement with subject control, you would put
"new frame PP-PP-TO-INF-SC".  Don't worry about the naming being
perfect, as anything requiring a new frame is going to get manually
reviewed anyway.

2.3
Tick the Passive checkbox if one of the NPs in the sentence is
passivized. To diagnose the passive, there must be a "to be"
auxiliary. An agentive by-phrase is not required. "Undo" the passive
before choosing the SCF, so that the surface subject is considered the
object for the purpose of subcategorization.
['type']   The letter had been typed by the professor.
           => scf 24, Passive
['type']   The letter, which the professor was typing, was long.
           => scf 24, but not Passive because no auxiliary (relative clause)
['advise'] Mary was advised by Susan to attend the meeting.
           => scf 53, Passive
['advise'] Mary was advised to attend the meeting.
           => scf 53, Passive
['advise'] Mary, advised by Susan to attend the meeting, was worried.
           => scf 53, but not Passive because no auxiliary (Past Participle, see point 2.5)

2.4
Relative clauses: simply "undo" the relativization to determine the SCF.
['type']   The letter, which the professor was typing, was long.
           => scf 24
['like']   I gave the letter to a woman who likes to swim.
           => scf 112

2.5
Tick the Past Participle checkbox if the verb is a past participial
modifier, whether offset by commas or not. These are typically
reduced relative clauses, i.e. relative clauses with no relative
pronoun. They are typically postnominal but can be prenominal.
Again, "undo" the relativization to recover the SCF.
['advise'] Mary, advised by Susan to attend the meeting, was worried.
           => scf 53, Past Participle
['eat']    The mushroom eaten by the elephant was poisonous.
           => scf 24, Past Participle
['scare']  Scared to death, Adam ran away.
           => scf 49, preposition "to", Past Participle

2.6
If you happen to notice that a temporal, manner, or location
adjunct is present, tick the Temporal Adjunct, Manner Adjunct, 
or Location Adjunct box, respectively. These are semantic, not
syntactic categories, e.g. manner could be "quickly" or "in a 
hurry"; temporal could be "in March" or "someday" or "last 
month". Figurative categories are allowed, e.g. "in your dreams" 
could be locative. *IMPORTANT*: Use these only if you happen to 
notice the adjuct and feel compelled to record it. These are for 
exploratory data collection and they do not have to be systematic.

2.7
To deal with highly selected adjunct prepositional phrases (or other
phrase types, though this occurs most often with PPs), you can use the
Alternate Frames box to notate possible alternative SCFs. In general,
err on the side of including more phrases as arguments if you are
unsure, when the phrase seems selected by the verb but is not
obligatory. More than one alternate SCF can be indicated by commas. If
the alternate SCF(s) have a preposition or particle, separate these by
a hyphen. If you feel that the main SCF is the less elaborate one and
the alternate SCF is more complex, this can be annotated as
well. *IMPORTANT*: don't agonize over these decisions; this facility
is designed to avoid having to agonize over whether a phrase is part
of the SCF by making it easy to specify alternatives!
['continue'] If trading continues at such a high volume, the market will crash.
             => scf 87, preposition "at", alternate frame: 22
['provide']  PSEG provides electricity for ten million customers.
             => scf 31, preposition "for", alternate frame: 24
['start']    We started at the beginning.
             => scf 87, preposition "at", alternate frame: 22-loc
['help']     I want to help out in the crisis.
             => scf 74, particle "out", alternate frame: 78-out-in
['reduce']   We will reduce the level to 50 percent by 2020.
             => scf 122, prepositions "to-by", alternate frame: 49-to, 24

2.8
If a frame contains one or more prepositions, put the observed prepositions
in the Prepositions box. If there is more than one, separate them with
a hyphen.
['reduce'] We will reduce the level by 50 percent by 2020.
           => scf 122, prepositions "by-by"

2.9
If a frame contains one or more particles, put the observed particle in the
Particles box.
['make'] We made up the evidence.
         => scf 76, particle "up"

2.10
Put any other comments freeform in the comments box. Use commas between 
multiple comments for a single sentence.

3. SPECIFIC CONSTRUCTIONS

3.1
Purpose clauses: 
Treat as adjuncts.
['give'] Mary gave Susan the book to improve her knowledge of the industry.
         => scf 37
Purpose clauses (infinitives of purpose) can be diagnosed by the "in order
to" paraphrase.
Mary gave Susan the book to improve her knowledge.
=
Mary gave Susan the book in order to improve her knowledge.
BUT
Mary asked Susan to leave.
=/= 
Mary asked Susan in order to leave.

3.2
Discontinuous constituents: 
Treat as though they were continuous.
['give'] Information will be given to participants about the summit.
         => scf 56, passive (note that "about the summit" is not an argument of "give")        

3.3
Passivised clausal arguments: 
Although the passive marker generally refers to an NP argument, it is possible to have
a passivized clausal argument.
['reveal'] How the magician's tricks work will soon be revealed.
           => scf 16, passive

3.4
Temporal nominals: 
Treat as arguments in general, although alternatives can be noted.
['start'] The project started the month of June.
          => scf 24, alternate scf 22-tmp

3.5
Free relatives: 
Treat as though they were not wh-elements. This is because verbs 
that do not normally take (interrogative) wh-complements can still 
be used in free relatives.
['eat']  I'll have what she's eating.
         => scf 24
['know'] I served her what I know to be the best burger in town.
         => scf 57 (not scf 116)

3.6
Don't be fooled by objects extracted from embedded verbs.
['wish'] She is one who I wish to get to know.
         => scf 112 ("she" is an object of "know", not "wish")

3.7
Deciding whether a PP is an argument of the verb or of a post-verbal 
nominal can be quite difficult.  Here are some possible tactics.
a. Remove the intervening nominal. "This site contains resources for 
balancing your budget." Are the resources for balancing your budget,
or is the containment for balancing your budget?: the former, so 
argument of nominal.
b. Use "it"-replacement for the intervening nominal. "This site 
contains it for balancing your budget." Awkward, so argument of nominal.

3.8 
Prepositions vs particles:
There are a few diagnostics for prepositions vs. particles.
First, PPs can be clefted.
['upon'] The mayor called upon them for help. (upon = preposition, them = obj of prep)
         The mayor looked up the number. (up = particle, the number = obj of verb)
         => scf 67
         It was upon them that the mayor called for help. (awkward, but not ungrammatical)
         * It was up the number that the mayor looked.

3.9
Clausal complements:
Use scf 104 for S, and scf 109 for THAT-S.

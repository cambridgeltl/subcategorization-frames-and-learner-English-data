Sources of regulation
Art. 88 of the Venezuelan       Constitution [1] states that       the law shall adopt measures intended to guarantee stability of labour       and shall establish the benefits to compensate for seniority of service     of a worker and protect him in case of unemployment.
The primary source relating to labour is the Basic Labour       Act (BLA) of 27 November 1990. [2] Collective agreements are another source of law which often encompass       termination of employment, making particular reference to dismissal for       invalid reasons, procedures and benefits. In practice, tripartite commissions       established through agreements place high priority on problems linked to       dismissal. The case law of labour courts and decisions of the labour inspectorate       (and decisions to settle legal disputes) supplement these sources of regulation,       particularly in the area of immunities.
Scope of legislation
Career officials and white-collar employees in public service       at the national, state or municipal levels are not covered by the provisions       of the BLA in so far as they are governed by the administrative career       regulations. Nevertheless, in any matter not so regulated they may enjoy       benefits through labour legislation applicable to workers in the private       sector. Members of the armed forces and state security corps are also excluded       from the scope of this legislation ( secs. 7 and 8 , BLA).
All enterprises, establishments, undertakings and businesses,       whether state-owned, in existence or yet to be founded in Venezuela, and       in general any performance of personal service involving employers and       workers in any form whatsoever, are subject to the provisions of the BLA,       the sole exceptions being those explicitly mentioned in the Act ( sec. 15 ,       BLA).
Apprentices, young persons, domestic workers, caretakers,       home workers, professional sports people, rural workers, persons employed       in land, air and inland water transport, seafarers, motorized workers,       actors, musicians, folklorists and other intellectual and cultural workers       and disabled persons are covered by special conditions ( Title V, Special       Conditions , BLA).
Contracts of employment
Pursuant to sec. 67 of the BLA, an employment contract       is one whereby a person undertakes to render services to another, under       the control of the latter and in return for remuneration.  
There are no statutory provisions for probation periods.       There is a trial period of 90 days for workers assigned to a higher       post, although this can in no way be construed as constituting indirect       dismissal ( sec. 103(2) , BLA).
In principle, a contract is deemed to be of indeterminate       duration if the parties do not explicitly state the desire to be bound       by an employment relationship solely for a specified task or for a specified       period ( sec. 72 et seq. , BLA). The following three conditions govern       the conclusion of contracts for a specified period:
for         a contract for a specified period, blue-collar workers, one year maximum;
for         a contract for a specified period, white-collar workers, three years       maximum; and
for         a contract for a specified task, the time necessary for its performance.
In the first two cases, contracts may be concluded only       when the nature of the service warrants it, for example, the provisional       and legitimate replacement of a worker and when Venezuelan workers conclude       contracts to work outside the country. An extension may be granted, although       in the case of two or more extensions the contract is considered to be       of indeterminate duration. The contract is also deemed of indeterminate       duration if, within a month of its expiry, a new contract is concluded       between the same parties, unless the parties clearly demonstrate their       mutual wish to end the relationship.
If, within a month of the termination       of a contract for a particular task, the parties conclude a new contract       for the performance of another task, it will be understood that they were       bound from the outset of the relationship for an indeterminate period.
Termination of employment
Employment may be terminated, under sec. 98 of the       BLA, other than at the initiative of the employer, by mutual agreement       by the parties, for reasons foreign to the wishes of both, [3] and on the resignation of the worker.
Resignation is the unilateral       termination of the employment relationship by the worker. The BLA does       not impose an obligation on the worker to submit written notice of resignation       stating the reason, if any, for such action. Indeed, the BLA provides for       termination of employment by the worker without reason and requires only       the submission of notice ranging from seven to 30 days, depending on the       workers length of service (after a month, seven days; after six months,       15 days; and after one year, 30 days). In lieu of notice, in the case of       contracts of indeterminate duration, the worker must indemnify the employer       by payment of a sum corresponding to the wages he or she would have earned       during the notice period ( sec. 107 , BLA). In the case of contracts       for a specified period or task, the judge may order a worker to pay as       compensation for damages an amount which must not exceed one-half of the       remuneration which would have been due up to the completion of the task       or service ( sec. 110 , BLA).
However, if resignation is for a justified reason, there       is a 30-day period in which the worker may invoke the right to resign ( sec.       101 , BLA). Resignation is considered justified when it is based on       a reason prescribed by statute and its financial effects are equivalent       to those of unjustified dismissal (see below). Dishonesty, immoral actions       with regard to the worker or his or her family, insult or serious lack       of respect towards the worker or his or her family, forgetfulness which jeopardizes safety or health in the workplace, serious breach of the obligations       under the contract of employment, and any act amounting to indirect dismissal       ( secs. 100 and 103 , BLA) constitute just cause for resignation.  
Dismissal  is indirect when an employer       who wishes to terminate employment uses indirect means to induce the worker       to resign, and gives cause for justified resignation. Indirect dismissal       is also considered by law to cover the following cases ( sec. 103(1) ,       BLA):
if         a worker is required to do work which is distinct from that for which       he or she was engaged, or which is incompatible with the workers dignity         or qualifications;
if         a worker is required to perform services which occasion a change of residence         which was not stipulated in the contract or implied in the nature of       the work;
if         remuneration or grade of the workers post are lowered; or
if         working hours are arbitrarily changed or any similar actions are taken.
Dismissal
According to Venezuelan law, dismissal is the manifestation       of the employers desire to end the employment relationship ( sec. 99 ,       BLA). Dismissal is unjustified when the worker has committed no action       to justify it. Such justification must be claimed within 30 consecutive       days after the date on which the worker is informed, or should have been       informed, of the facts constituting grounds for the unilateral termination       of employment by the employer ( sec. 101 , BLA). This also applies       to reasons relating to the operational requirements of the undertaking       such as collective dismissal and staff reduction without prior notification.       Mass dismissal is classified as the loss of employment by 10 per cent of       the workers in an enterprise employing more than 100 persons, 20 per cent       of more than 50 workers, or ten workers in an undertaking employing fewer       than 50 workers, within a period of three months ( sec. 34 , BLA).
The contract of employment may be terminated for ( sec.         102 , BLA):
dishonesty         or immoral behaviour;
acts         of violence except in legitimate self-defence;
insult         or serious lack of respect towards the employer, his or her representatives         or family members living in his or her home;
deliberate         action or a gross negligent act affecting safety or health in the workplace;
forgetfulness         or carelessness seriously affecting safety or health in the workplace;
unjustified         absence from work for three working days within the period of one month;
material         damage to the plant, tools, furniture belonging to the enterprise, raw         materials, finished or partly processed products, plantations or other         relevant property, whether deliberate or resulting from serious negligence;
disclosure         of secrets of production, construction or process;
serious         breach of the obligations under the contract of employment; or
abandonment         of work, which is defined as:
leaving       the workplace inopportunely or without valid reason during working hours,       without authorization from the employer or his or her representative;
refusal       to perform the assigned tasks under the agreed terms of the labour contract       or legislation. However, the refusal to undertake work         which might create an imminent or serious hazard to the life or health         of the worker is not considered abandonment; or
unjustified       absence by a worker responsible for a process or machine when such absence       entails disruption in the rest of the service or production         process.
Venezuelan law provides that certain workers, for various       reasons, are irremovable and may not be dismissed, transferred or employed       in less favourable working conditions without just cause approved in advance       by the labour inspector ( sec. 449 , BLA). This protection is, generally,       reserved for trade union promoters and board members, promoters of collective       agreements and workers involved in collective disputes against employers,       but has also been extended to other categories of persons, whether or not       they are linked to trade union activity or collective relations. The following       may therefore enjoy protection under the BLA:
a         worker who has been suspended from work ( sec. 94 );
a         pregnant woman, during pregnancy and up to one year after confinement       ( sec.         384 );
an         adoptive mother, during the year following adoption ( sec. 384(1) );
board         members of a trade union, during their management and up to three months         after the expiry of the term for which they were elected ( sec. 451 );
promoters         (and applicants for memberships), from the date of notification until       registration of the union, which should not exceed three months ( sec. 450 );
the         trade union delegate aboard a ship flying the Venezuelan flag ( sec.         356 );
workers         during trade union elections, from the notice of convocation until the         election itself, a period which should not exceed three months within       a period of two years ( sec. 452 );
workers         involved in a collective labour dispute ( secs. 458 and 506 );
workers         affected by a draft collective agreement, during the period of negotiations         and up to 180 days, which may be extended by 90 days in exceptional circumstances         ( secs. 458 and 520 );
workers         who accept changes in working conditions for economic reasons which jeopardize         the work or existence of the enterprise, during the period the agreement         is in force ( secs. 525 and 526 );
workers         affected by the request procedure of the standard-setting labour meetings,         during the meeting session ( secs. 528 and 533(f) );
workers         who are appointed labour directors or substitutes during their terms       in office ( sec. 617 ); and
members         of the safety and health committee of the enterprise while they are exercising         their functions on the committee ( sec. 37 ). [4]
Notice and prior procedural safeguards
Notice of dismissal must be made in writing and state the       reason on which it is based. An employer is not permitted to subsequently       rely on a reason for dismissal that is not specified in the notice. Where       a dismissal has been issued orally, the absence of a written document does       not prevent an employee who wished to challenge his or her dismissal from       using other evidence to prove that he or she has been dismissed ( sec.       195 , BLA). Furthermore, the employer is required to inform the district       labour-stability judge of the dismissal, stating the reasons justifying       his or her action within five working days. Failure to do so will be interpreted       as the employers acknowledgement of lack of justification for the dismissal       ( sec. 116 , BLA).
Notice in the case of unjustified dismissal must be conveyed       in advance according to the following schedule ( sec. 104 , BLA):
after         one months service, one week;
after         six months service, two weeks;
after         one years service, one month;
after         five years service, two months; and
after         ten years service, three months.
In lieu of notice, the worker should be paid a sum equivalent       to the remuneration he or she would have received during the corresponding       period ( sec. 106 , BLA). In addition,       a worker will receive compensation in lieu of notice as follows ( sec.       104 , BLA):
15         days wages when the period of service is more than one month but six       months or less;
30         days wages when it is more than six months but less than one year;
45         days wages when it is one year or more;
60         days wages when it is two years or more but less than ten years; and
90         days wages when it is ten years or more.
The Ministry of Labour may suspend collective dismissals,       for social reasons, by a special ruling and submit the dispute to arbitration       if the parties cannot reach an agreement, or if reasons of an economic,       technological or structural nature are invoked ( sec. 34 , BLA). The       trade union to which the workers belong or, in the absence of a trade union,       the workers themselves must be notified of the employers application.       There are no express provisions for compensation in this case. The worker       is entitled to a period of notice, as follows ( sec 104 , BLA):
after         one months service, one week in advance;
after         six months service, two weeks in advance;
after         one years service, one month in advance;
after         five years service, two months in advance; and
after         ten years service, three months in advance.
In lieu of notice, the worker may be compensated with a       sum equivalent to the remuneration he or she would have received during       the corresponding period ( sec. 106 , BLA).
Legislation ( sec. 453 , BLA) lays down an administrative       procedure for requests submitted by the employer to dismiss, transfer or       justifiably lower the working conditions of the worker enjoying trade union       immunity. Similarly, a statutory provision provides ( sec. 454 , BLA)       for these workers the procedure of reinstatement ( reenganche ) in       the event that the employer may have dismissed, transferred or lowered       the working conditions of a worker without fulfilling the above-mentioned       requirements.
Severance pay
In the case of unjustified dismissal in contracts for a       specified task or service, the employer is obliged to pay compensation       for damages in an amount equal to that of the remuneration which would       have been due up to the completion of the task or expiry of the period       ( sec. 110 , BLA).
If the employer insists on dismissing the worker he or       she must pay, in addition to the salaries which the worker would have earned       during the legal proceedings, compensation amounting to ten days wages       if the employees length of service is between three and six months; 30       days wages if the length of service is six months or more, and then 30       days wages for each year of service, up to a maximum of 150 days wages       ( sec. 125 , BLA). Moreover, the employer may, upon dismissal, double       the severance allowance and thereby avoid legal proceedings for reinstatement       mentioned below and the payment of wages accrued during the course of such       proceedings ( sec. 126 , BLA).
In accordance with the 1997 revision of the law, the worker       has the right to a seniority bonus that accrues interest and that is to       be paid monthly or upon termination of the employment relationship at the       workers initiative ( sec. 108 , BLA). This is the equivalent of:
after         three months of service, five days wages;
after         the second year of service, an additional two days wages per year of       service, up to a maximum of 30 years.
When the employment relationship ends, the worker has a       right to a seniority benefit, up to 75 per cent of which can be payable       in advance. The amount is:
15         days wages or, if monthly contributions or deposits have been made,       the proportion of this amount remaining to be paid, when the period of       service         is between three and six months;
the         difference between the amount contributed or deposited monthly and 45       days wages when the period of service is more than six months but less       than         one year; or
the         difference between the amount contributed or deposited monthly in the       year in which the employment relationship ended and 60 days wages, after       the         first year of service, and provided the worker has been working for more         than six months of the relevant year.
Bankruptcy is one of the hypothetical reasons for the termination       of employment and in such cases the rights derived from the relationship       of employment are preferential. Payments to workers are handled independently       of bankruptcy proceedings by creditors. The amount of compensation varies       depending on whether the bankruptcy was fraudulent or fortuitous. If bankruptcy       is deemed to be caused by third parties or through negligence, the worker       has the right to double compensation, whereas if bankruptcy has resulted       from unforeseen or inevitable events it is considered fortuitous.
Avenues for redress
Reinstatement of the worker represents an option between       admission to employment and compensation by the employer.
Depending on the circumstances and nature of the termination,       the presiding judge may rule that the worker should be reinstated and back       wages paid. Rehiring is also an option for the employer ( secs. 125 and       126 , BLA). However, temporary, provisional, occasional and domestic       workers are not entitled to reinstatement. Likewise, employers who regularly       employ fewer than ten persons are not obliged to reinstate dismissed workers       ( secs. 112 and 117 , BLA).
Once the type of dismissal has been established, the judge       must give notice to the employer to submit his or her rebuttal within five       working days, initiating a probation period of eight working days, unless       the judge deems it unnecessary. When this period has expired, the judge       must pronounce a verdict on the justification or inadmissibility of the       dismissal in a time limit not exceeding 15 working days, provided that       a request has not been made for the constitution of a tribunal to pronounce       a verdict ( secs. 117, 118 and 119 , BLA).
Appeals against the verdict may be lodged with the Higher       Labour Tribunal which will decide on the substance of the dispute and confirm       or reject the plea for reinstatement and payment of forfeited wages. No       appeal is allowed to the court of cassation against a decision of this       Tribunal ( secs. 121, 122 and 123 , BLA).

Constitution
After more than three centuries of British rule, the Irish Free             State was founded in 1921. Its first Constitution was enacted in             1922.  The present Constitution was adopted by referendum in             1937, and it was amended several times since its adoption.  In             1973 Ireland  joined the European Community.
The Constitution defines Ireland as a sovereign, independent and             democratic state. It sets out the administrative structure of the             Government and states that all powers of the Government derive             under God from the people. It defines the structure and principles             of legal and social policy to guide the Oireachtas (Parliament).             The rights of every citizen are also enshrined in the constitution.
The national languages are Irish and English.
Ireland is a parliamentary democracy. The National Parliament             (Oireachtas) consists of the President and two Houses : Dáil             Éireann (the House of Representatives) and Seanad             Éireann (the Senate). For a law to be adopted, it must be             approved by both houses of the Oireachtas and signed into law by             the President. 
The Head of the Government is the Taoiseach (Prime Minister). He               or she is appointed by the President, and may keep his or her post               as             long as the Government retains a majority, up to a maximum of five             years. He or she shall resign from office upon his ceasing to             retain the support of a majority in Dáil Éireann unless on his             advice the President dissolves Dáil Éireann and on the reassembly             of Dáil Éireann after the dissolution the Taoiseach secures the             support of a majority in Dáil Éireann.
The Head of the State is the President. He or she is appointed by             direct vote of the people, for a mandate of seven years, and can be             re-elected only once.
The Judiciary  is made up of the Chief Justice and seven other             members of the Supreme Court, High Court judges, Circuit Court             judges and District Court judges.
Under the Constitution, the State guarantees the right of the             citizens to form associations and unions. (art. 40.6.(iii)). Laws,             however, may be enacted for the regulation and control in the             public interest of the exercise of the foregoing right.  Laws             regulating the manner in which the right of forming associations             and unions and the right of free assembly may be exercised shall             contain no political, religious or class discrimination . Under             article 45 the State shall, in particular, direct its policy             towards securing that the citizens (all of whom, men and women             equally, have the right to an adequate means of livelihood) may             through their occupations find the means of making reasonable             provision for their domestic needs.  The same article further             states that the State shall endeavour to ensure that the             strength and health of workers, men and women, and the tender age             of children shall not be abused and that citizens shall not be             forced by economic necessity to enter avocations unsuited to their             sex, age or strength.
Labour Regulation
Irish labour law has developed according to a British-style             voluntarist model. The traditional view accepted by lawyers and             industrial relations practitioners and actors was that the law             should adopt an abstentionist role in relation to collective             bargaining and industrial action, while supporting the individual             employment relationship with a safety net of rights and             obligations. In general, the law was not used to impose employment             conditions, other than the basic minima in such areas as protection             from unfair dismissal, organisation of working time, employment             equality and occupational safety and health.
However, changed economic and political conditions in the 1980s             shattered this voluntarist consensus. Growing pressure from both             employers and unions, political concern at addressing the perceived             inflationary result of free collective bargaining, and the             increased intervention of the EC in regulating the individual             employment relationship all contributed to this change. As a             result, labour law has become increasingly regulated, both at             collective and individual level (see below).
Legislation on individual labour relations - A whole range of Acts,             most deriving from EU Directives, now provide different forms of             employment protection to individual employees. The most important             of these are:
Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act 1973
Organisation of Working Time Act 1997
Payment of Wages Act 1991
Maternity Protection Act 1994
Parental Leave Act 1998.
Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977-93
Legislation on collective labour relations
The Industrial Relations Act 1990 regulates industrial action.             Collective bargaining is governed not by legislation but by a             series of nationally-negotiated pay agreements based upon a social             partnership model. Every three years the Government,             representatives of the trade union movement, of employers'             organisations and more recently also drawn from the             non-governmental 'social pillar' (ie voluntary groups) come             together to negotiate a national agreement which fixes wage             increases and other payments generally. The agreement also sets a             framework for a wide range of government policies, ranging from,             for example, education to national infrastructural development. The             most recent is the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness (PPF) .
Other sources of labour regulation
Administrative Regulations : These are of increasing             importance as the quantity of labour  legislation increases,             and some incorporate important individual employee protections,             eg  the European Communities (Safeguarding of Employees Rights             on transfer of Undertakings) Regulations 1980.
Collective agreements : again these are of increasing             importance. Although traditionally, collective agreements did not             have any binding legal effect, this is now changing: for example             under the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 collective             agreements may be used to provide for legally enforceable             mechanisms for compensatory rest arrangements.
Judicial decisions : in the Irish common law system, judicial             decisions create precedent so they represent an important source of             labour regulation.
Contract of Employment
Employment law is based on an assumption that an employer and             employee, or 'master' and 'servant' in the old language, enter into             a contractual relationship freely and voluntarily, on equal terms,             and that this sets out the terms and conditions of employment.             Traditionally, the regulation of the employment relationship has             taken place almost exclusively at this individual contractual             level. Irish employment law is therefore almost an extension of the             law of contract, since much of its substance derives from and             relates to contract law.
A contract of employment can be verbal or written, or a combination             of both.  The contract comes into existence when agreement is             reached between employer and employee, when the offer of employment             by the employer is accepted by the employee.  Accordingly             every employee has a contract of employment.  The details of a             contract of employment are referred to as its terms.  Both the             Common Law and Statute however recognise that all contracts of             employment should contain basic terms and obligations particularly             basic protections for employees.  Such basic terms are             included in each contract of employment whether expressly agreed             between employer and employee or not, they are implied into each             contract of employment.  The parties are of course free to             agree any terms suitable to the particular employment and to agree             terms, which go beyond the minimum legal protections. 
It is also common practice, particularly in employments where there             is trade union representation for the parties to conclude a             collective agreement, regarding terms, conditions, work practices             and rules of employment, which applies to all employees in             membership of the union. However, as collective agreements are not             legally binding they cannot be enforced as such, for example before             a tribunal. In order to bind the individual employer and the             employee the collective agreement must be specfically incorporated             into the contract of employment of each employee.
Unlimited and fixed-term contracts of employment
Most contracts of employment are unlimited i.e. they do not specify             an end-date. Fixed-term contracts of employment are generally             treated the same way as unlimited contracts, except that they are             subject to special rules about termination as, subject to certain             conditions, they are exempted from the provisions of the Unfair             Dismissals Acts 1977-93. In other words, the parties can agree,             subject to formalities, to "contract out" of the Act where fixed             term or specific purpose contracts are in operation.  However,             abuse of fixed term and specific purpose contracts by an employer             or successive renewals on expiry designed to avoid the provisions             of the Acts will entitle an employee with the requisite service to             the protection of the Acts.
Special contracts of employment
There are no special contracts of employment, although in the past,             another type of employment relationship was deemed to exist where a             person was working for the State in the civil service, for example.             Such a person was regarded as holding 'office', ie their status was             not that of employee but rather of 'office-holder'. They were seen             as holding office at the will of the Executive (the Government),             which could thus dismiss them at will. The only constraint on the             power to dismiss at will was that the Government had to act subject             to the principles of natural justice and fair procedures.
The term office-holder  has now fallen into disuse, and civil             servants are almost exclusively viewed as employees. Only             Government Ministers, and those appointed directly by the Minister,             might now be seen as office-holders. However the principles of             natural justice and fair procedures developed in the courts in             litigation involving dismissal of office-holders have now been             applied generally, and continue to be applied, by the Employment             Appeal Tribunal in any cases involving dismissal of employees.
Probation
Most contracts of employment specify a probation period of twelve             months. The Unfair Dismissals Acts do not apply until an employee             has worked for twelve months, so during the probation period the             employee may be dismissed at will subject to rules on fair             procedures and wrongful dismissal.
Suspension of the contract of employment - Grounds for             suspension
The employees service is continuous unless he/she is dismissed or             leaves voluntarily. Service is not broken by a lock-out, lay-off,             strike or change of ownership of business or dismissal followed by             immediate re-engagement.  During these periods the contract is             regarded as being suspended. Employees who are laid off or on short             time and who claim in line with the Redundancy Payments Acts             1967-1991 are entitled to statutory notice entitlements.
Dismissal or termination is defined in the Unfair Dismissals Acts             as occurring in the following situations:
The termination of the contract of employment by the employer with             /without notice.
A constructive dismissal - that is the termination of the contract             of employment by the employee with or without notice, in             circumstances where, because of the conduct of the employer, the             employee was entitled, or it was reasonable for the employee to             terminate the contract without notice. We are dealing here with             resignations by the employee which are brought about by the             unreasonable conduct of the employer (some examples would include             sexual harassment, unfounded or unsubstantiated accusations of             pilferage, physical threats or violence toward employee, extreme             isolation of employee).
The expiration of a fixed term or specific purpose contract (see             above).
Grounds for termination  at the initiative of the             employer
S.6(1) of the Act provides that the dismissal is deemed unfair             "unless, having regard to the circumstances, there were substantial             grounds justifying the dismissal". It ensues that, in order to             establish a fair dismissal the employer must show that the reason             for dismissal falls into one of the categories of reasons for dismissal that are regarded as fair.  The employer must also             establish of course that the dismissal on the grounds specified was             justified.
The employer may be able to justify dismissal on the following             grounds:
Capability, competence or qualifications of the employee (e.g.             absence, lack of capacity, ability).
The             conduct of the employee (e.g. theft, assault, clocking offences).
Redundancy
The             employer is prohibited by Statute from continuing the employment             (e.g. safety requirements in line with Statute or requirement to             have a particular class of driving licence).
Other             substantial grounds justifying dismissal (e.g. unreasonable refusal             to accept changes in the contract of employment, excessive             disruption, inability of employee to meet insurance requirements).
Notice
Notice is provided for under the Minimum Notice and Terms of             Employment Act 1973. Depending on the employee's length of             employment, he or she is entitled to between one week and 8 weeks'             notice. However many contracts of employment provide for longer             notice entitlement.
Severance payment
Apart from redundancy an employee is not entitled to any payment             other than payment in lieu of notice, where applicable, once the             dismissal is fair. If the dismissal is deemed to be unfair, he or             she may be entitled to compensation (see below).
Redundancy
An employee is always entitled to a payment in a redundancy             situation. Under the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967-91, a redundancy             arises in the event of a termination of employment where an             employer requires fewer employees or a lesser number of employees             of a particular kind.  Redundancy can arise for a variety of             reasons under the Acts.
An employee is entitled to a Statutory Redundancy Payment where:
(a)        He or she is             dismissed by reason of redundancy, or
(b)        He or she is laid off             or on short-time for a period of 4 consecutive weeks or 6 weeks out             of any 13 consecutive week period.
An employer intending to make an employee redundant must             give the employee at least 2 weeks written notice (a copy of such             notice must be sent to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and             Employment). As the redundancy constitutes a termination of             employment, the notice period required under the Minimum Notice and             Terms of Employment Act 1973 or the Contract of Employment may be             greater than 2 weeks. On the date of dismissal the employer must             give the employee the completed redundancy form (RP2) together with             the lump sum payment.
Statutory Redundancy Payment
When an employee has been dismissed by reason of redundancy he is             entitled to a statutory lump sum or redundancy payment, calculated             as follows:
A half week's normal weekly remuneration (includes any fixed             allowances) for each year of continuous service between the ages of             16-41 year
and
A week's normal weekly remuneration for each year of continuous             service between age 41 - 66 years and the equivalent of one weeks             normal weekly remuneration There is a statutory ceiling on the             maximum statutory payment, which is adjusted as deemed appropriate             by Ministerial Order. The employer is also obliged to pay statutory             minimum notice or notice under the Contract,whichever is the             greater, and outstanding holiday entitlements and this should not             be overlooked.
In reality, in industry where a redundancy situation arises and the             business is ongoing (not in liquidation or receivership) a payment             in excess of the statutory redundancy is negotiated. This is             particularly so where a union is representing the employees Sums             paid in addition to the statutory entitlement are classified as             ex-gratia severance payments. A typical settlement would be             statutory redundancy plus 3 to 5 weeks pay per year of service             ex-gratia; some reports suggest that the typical redundancy payment             is five or six times greater than the statutory requirement. Also,             where a precedent has been set in terms of redundancy payments from             a previous settlement, this may dictate future settlements.
Collective Agreements may also contain provisions allowing a             reference to Industrial Relations mechanism, e.g. a Conciliation             Officer of the Labour Court, to make a recommendation in a dispute.             In addition, with regard to selection for redundancy or lay-off, a             Collective Agreement or even a Contract of Employment may outline             the procedure to be adopted in selection.  A typical             arrangement would include selection on the basis of seniority, all             things being equal and having regard to the needs, skills and             dictates (commercial considerations) of the business.
Redundancy Payment Fund
Employer PRSI redundancy contributions are paid into a fund             established under the 1967 Act and in the event of a             redundancy/ies) the relevant Minister may make a rebate payment to             the employer of up to 60% of the statutory lump sum payment. The             employer is obliged to comply with certain formalities:
(i) The claim must             be made within 6 months of the date of redundancy
(ii) He or she must include a copy of the RP2.
(iii) A copy of the RP3 rebate form certifying essential details must be             sent to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.
Collective Redundancies
Redundancy procedures must also comply with EC Directives. The             relevant Directive is E.C. Directive 75/129/EEC as amended by             Directive 92/56/EEC, which came into Irish law on 9 December 1996.             Both Directives have been consolidated into Council Directive             98/59/EC of 20 July 1998. The Protection of Employment Act, 1977,             as amended by the Protection of Employment Order, 1996 (SI No. 370             of 1996) implements these Directives and provides protection for             employees faced with scale or mass redundancies. The Act does not             apply to establishments employing less than 21 people.
Where the Act does apply, it requires full exchange of information             and consultation with 'employees' representatives' concerned, and             also for consultation with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and             Employment. Employers are required to hold consultations with             'employees' representatives' at the earliest opportunity, or at             least 30 days before the first redundancy is implemented.             'Employees' representatives' mean a trade union or staff             association or a person or persons chosen by the employees likely             to be affected by the redundancies to represent them. The employer             is obliged to provide the representatives with all information in             writing in relation to the proposed redundancies, including the             reason/s for the redundancies, the number proposed to be made             redundant and the criteria to be used. The same notice period and             information applies to the employer's obligation to notify the             Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. An employer who does             not comply with the statutory consultation process shall be guilty             of an offence and may be fined up to 635 Euros.
Collective redundancies are defined as arising from redundancy             during any period of 30 consecutive days where the employees being             made redundant are as follows:
When 5 or more employees in a workforce of between 21-49 employees             are to be made redundant; or
10 employees in a 50-99 strong workforce,  or
10% in a workforce numbering 100-299 or 30 or
more employees in a workforce of 300+.
Remedies in case of  unfair dismissal
There are three alternative remedies:
Compensation
Re-engagement
The Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Act 1993 now provides that the             Tribunal should specify the reasons they have adopted a particular             form of redress as against others.
Compensation : If compensation is awarded, the award is             subject to a maximum of 104 weeks remuneration.  Remuneration             includes basic pay, allowances, bonuses, benefit-in-kind and             employers' contribution to Pension and V.H.I. schemes where             applicable. The Tribunal, in setting the award, must consider             actual and prospective loss.  The Tribunal can reduce the             level of an award due to the employees' contribution to the             dismissal, the employees' failure to mitigate the loss or the             employees' ability to mitigate the loss by securing alternative             employment.  The calculation of awards is usually based on net             remuneration.  The U.D.A. (Amendment) Act 1993 now permits the             Tribunal to disregard Social Welfare benefits and tax rebates             received by the claimant in assessing compensation levels.              Where there has been no financial loss incurred the Tribunal may             now make a financial award of up to 4 weeks pay.
Reinstatement : If this is awarded, the employment is             reinstated without loss of any rights or remuneration.  The             employee is returned to the exact same job, with salary arrears             from date of dismissal.
Re-engagement :    Where this is awarded, the             employee is entitled to either the same job as previously held or             suitable job under the circumstances.  The Tribunal can             exercise flexibility with this remedy, the period since the date of             dismissal may be regarded as suspension without pay, continuity of             service is usually preserved and the Tribunal may leave any warning             or disciplinary measures short of dismissal intact.  The             Tribunal rarely invokes this remedy.
The Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Act 1993 now provides that the             Tribunal (the Employment Appeals Tribunal) should specify the             reasons they have adopted a particular form of redress as against             others. In practice, compensation is the remedy most commonly             awarded (in approximately 75% of successful claims). Re-engagement             and re-instatement are much less common remedies due to a number of             factors. In some cases, the employee may have already obtained             alternative employment. In others, relations between employer and             employee may have broken down to the extent that the Employment             Appeals Tribunal will be reluctant to enforce the resumption of a             working relationship. Finally, even where the employee succeeds in             claiming unfair dismissal, there may be some element of             contributory behaviour by the employee to the events leading to the             dismissal and in those cases, again, the Employment Appeals             Tribunal is reluctant to order that the employee be re-engaged or             re-instated. For all these reasons, compensation is far more             routinely awarded as a remedy.
Other remedies
Certain categories of office holders and employees of the State             (e.g. Gardai, Defence Forces) excluded from the legislation may             seek redress for dismissal in the ordinary courts.  Two             options may be available - an action for wrongful dismissal (this             option is open to any employee as an alternative to a claim under             the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977-1993), or judicial review of the             decision to dismissal seeking a court order quashing the dismissal             (an order of certiorari).   Such an action will usually be             based on a failure by the employer to comply with the tenets of             natural justice.  These principles include the right to be             fully informed of the complaint, the right to respond with the             benefit of adequate time and information to prepare and adequate             representation.
In Gleeson .v. Minister for Defence  (1976  Sup. Court),             Gleeson, a member of the Armed Forces, had been discharged             dishonourably on the basis of unsatisfactory conduct in breach of             specific regulations governing the conduct of members of the             Defence Forces.  Mr. Gleeson had not been granted an             opportunity to make representations prior to his discharge.              He sought to challenge the dismissal (on order of             Certiorari).  The Supreme Court found there had been a failure             to comply with the basic principles of natural justice and granted             the order, notwithstanding conduct in breach of regulations.              The opportunity to respond to a complaint however serious is a             fundamental right which ought not to be overlooked regardless of             the circumstances.
In Al Mutari .v. Midland Health Board  (1988 High Court) a             senior House Officer in St. Fintans Hospital was granted a             declaration by the High Court that his dismissal was null and void             where there  had been a failure by the Health Board to comply             with the principles of nature justice.In Gunn .v. National             College of Art & Design  (Supreme Court 1988) the Supreme             Court set aside doubts as to whether employees who were not office             holders were entitled to the protection of the principles of             natural justice.  In his judgement Justice Walsh indicated that the application of the rules of natural justice do not depend             on the status of the person, office holder or employee of another             kind.  "The quality of justice does not depend on such             distinctions".  However, it should be noted that where there             is clear agreement (a contract/collective agreement) or specific             statutory provisions which govern disciplinary and dismissal             procedures, the fairness or otherwise of the procedures adopted             will be judged on the basis of the terms and provisions of the             agreement or statute as applicable.
The Court of Appeal in England ( Donnell .v. London Borough of             Brent  (1986 Court of Appeal) and Hughes .v. London Borough             of Southampton  (1987 Court of Appeal)) has indicated that it             has power to grant an injunction to prevent a dismissal occurring             where the dismissal would be wrongful and/or in breach of the             principles of natural justice. In Farrell .v. IPBS 1993  High             Court the court refused an injunction to Mr. Farrell restraining             the IPBS from proceeding to have a meeting to consider his removal             from office.  The injunction was sought on the grounds that             there had been a failure to furnish full information relating to             the complaints against him.  The Court refused to grant the             injunction in the particular circumstances of the case but did not             indicate that an injunction could not be granted to restrain a             decision to dismiss where there had been a failure to comply with             the principles of natural justice in relation to the disciplinary             procedures adopted.
Termination at the initiative of the employee
An employee is always entitled to resign from employment, provided he or she gives the requisite period of notice (only one week under             the 1971 Act, but usually the contract provides for a longer             period). Where he/she is forced to resign by conduct of the             employer amounting to a breach of contract, a constructive             dismissal may arise.
Hours of Work
Working Time is regulated by the  Organisation of Working Time             Act 1997. Under this act the hours of work are limited to 48 hours             per week, subject to certain exceptions. However, the average or             standard working time may be lower, and it actually varies in the             different sectors.  Collective agreements normally address             this issue, as well as overtime. 
The Organisation of Working Time Act , 1997, also   provides             statutory minimum entitlements in respect of paid annual and public             holidays. Under this law employees are entitled to 4 working weeks             annual leave (20 days) in any leave year during which they have             worked 1,365 hours. Leave may also be calculated as one-third of a             working week for each month during which they have worked at least             117 hours, or 8% of the hours they have worked in the leave year,             subject to a maximum of 20 days. Any employee who has worked for at             least 8 months of the leave year is entitled to a 2 week unbroken             leave period.  Section 20 provides for times and pay for             annual leave.
Employees are entitled to a paid day off on the following 9 public             holidays: Christmas Day, St Stephen's Day, St Patrick's              (17
th
March), Easter Monday, the first Monday in May,             the first Monday in June and the first Monday in August, the last             Monday in October and the first day of January.
This issue is regulated by the Maternity Protection Act 1994 and associated             regulations, in particular:
Maternity Protection (Disputes and Appeals) Regulations 1995              (SI No. 17 of 1995)
Maternity Protection (Time off for Ante Natal and Post Natal              Care) Regulations 1995 (SI No. 18 of 1995)
Maternity Protection (Health and Safety Leave Certification)                 Regulations 1995 (SI No. 19 of 1995)
Maternity Protection (Health and Safety Leave Remuneration)                 Regulations 1995 (SI No. 20 of 1995)
For the purposes of the 1994 Act an employee is:
a person engaged under a contract of employment and who is             pregnant, having informed her employer of her condition, or
has recently given birth (whether to a living child or stillborn             child) and whose date of confinement was not more than 14 weeks             earlier and who has notified the employer of her condition is             breastfeeding within 26 weeks of the date of confinement and has             informed her employer of her condition, or
is the father of a living child where the mother has died within 14             weeks of the mothers week of confinement
The 1994 Act continues the pattern of extending the scope of             employment legislation to include atypical workers, as exemplified             in the Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Act 1993 and the Terms of             Employment (Information) Act 1994. Under the provisions of the             previous Maternity Act 1981, fixed term employees engaged for             periods of less than 26 weeks or with less than 26 weeks to run on             their contract were excluded from protection. Such employees now             have full protection for the term of their contract. There are no             service qualifications for employees as a prerequisite for             protection under the Act. Employees engaged on a probationary             period, trainees and Apprentices fall within the ambit of the Act,             as do employees engaged through the services of an employment             agency. Section 2(2)(c) provides that, for the purposes of the Act,             the person liable to pay the wages of an employee engaged through             an employment agency shall be deemed to be the employer. Officers             and servants of the State, including members of the Garda Siochana             and Defence Forces, and all other employees of the State, are not             excluded from the legislation and are deemed to be employees within             the meaning of the Act.
Maternity Leave
Article 8 of Directive 92/85/EEC, under which the 1994 Act was             introduced, stipulates a minimum period of 14 weeks maternity             leave, of which at least 2 must be allocated before and/or after             confinement. The provisions of the 1981 Act were consistent with             the 14-week period, but stipulated a period of leave minimum 4             weeks before and after confinement. This 4-week period is             maintained in sections 8 and 10 of the 1994 Act.
Under section 12 of the 1994 Act, maternity leave will be extended             where the date of confinement is after the expected week of             confinement. The extension will last for the number of weeks             necessary to ensure that there is a 4-week period of leave after             confinement. Such an extension is deemed to be maternity leave in             every respect. Under section 14 of the Act, additional leave, again             up to a maximum of 4 weeks, is solely at the option of the employee             and does not attract benefit payment. Service is continuous but not             computable or reckonable for the purposes of other protective             legislation.
Under section 3 of the Act, early confinement does not affect the             entitlement to 14 weeks' maternity leave. If the baby is born four             or more weeks before the expected week of confinement and leave has             not begun, the 14 weeks' maternity leave period commences on the             date of confinement. Where a pregnant employee is already on             maternity leave, her entitlement remains at 14 weeks and there is             no alteration to the expected date of return.
In addition to maternity leave, there is also provision for Health             and Safety leave. An employee who is pregnant, has given birth             within the previous 14 weeks, or is breastfeeding (for up to 26             weeks after the birth) and who as a result cannot do her job for             particular health and safety reasons, must be offered suitable             alternative employment. If none is available, she must be granted             health and safety leave, and must continue to be paid by her             employer for the first 21 days of such leave. Thereafter she is             entitled to be paid statutory health and safety benefit (see             below). The same rights to return to work on the same or suitable             alternative conditions apply in respect of an employee who has             taken health and safety leave, and an employee returning from             maternity leave.
Cash benefits and other entitlements during pregnancy and maternity             leave
Section 15 of the 1994 Act provides a general right to time off for             ante-natal and post-natal care , with the obligation on employers             to pay during ante-natal and post-natal care absences. The right to             time off without loss of pay covers the period from the beginning             of pregnancy through to 14 weeks after the confinement. The             entitlement to time off and payment for such absences is regulated             by the Maternity Protection (Time off for Ante-natal and Post-natal             Care) Regulations 1995.
Where health and safety leave is granted, section 18(4) of the 1994             Act obliges the employer to pay the employee's remuneration for a             period of 21 days in any relevant period. On the level of             remuneration and the manner of its payment, Regulation 3 of the             Maternity Protection (Health and Safety Leave Remuneration)             Regulations 1995 obliges the employer to pay an amount equal to             three times the employee's normal weekly pay.  There is no             payment in respect of weekend days not normally worked, although             Saturdays and Sundays are counted in the calculation that goes to             make up the 21 days. The definition of normal weekly pay excludes             any payments /remuneration or allowance in respect of overtime,             night work, shift work, unsocial hours or an employee being             available "on call".
Where the employee is paid at a fixed rate, i.e. a fixed salary,             weekly wage, allowance, daily/hourly rate, in relation to fixed             hours she should be entitled to 3 weeks' remuneration at that rate             excluding any amount attributable to overtime. The reference period             for establishing the rate of pay is the last week worked prior to             the grant of health and safety leave. Where a fixed allowance is             paid monthly or quarterly it must be apportioned on a pro rata             basis. Where an employee is not paid at a fixed rate, say for             example a commission-based employee, to calculate the 21-day             remuneration the reference period is the remuneration earned in the             previous 26-week period, the employee's weekly rate being equal to             one-26th of her total remuneration in the 26-week period.
The European Communities (Social Welfare) Regulations 1995 provide             for the payment of health and safety benefit to an employee who has             been granted certified health and safety leave within the meaning             of the 1994 Act. A maximum rate of benefit is set by regulation,             with scale rates depending on the level of reckonable earnings.             There is also provision for increase in this rate where there is an             adult or child dependant. In order to qualify for benefit the             claimant must meet qualifying conditions, as follows:
at least 13                 paid contributions in the 12 months before the expected or actual                 date of the baby's birth, or at least 39 paid contributions since                 first becoming insured, or in the last complete tax year prior              to the year prior to which health and safety benefit is claimed,              and
average earnings of                 not less than a prescribed amount.
Statutory Maternity Benefit (SMB)
The rules governing statutory maternity benefit are contained in             the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 1993 and the Social Welfare             (Consolidated Payments Provisions) Regulations 1994. An employee is             entitled to SMB if she is
in employment immediately before the first day of her maternity             leave; and
she has paid the qualifying amount of PRSI contributions, namely
at least 39 weeks of PRSI contributions in the 12-month period just             before the first day of her maternity leave; or
at least 39 weeks of PRSI contributions at any time since first             starting work, and at least 39 weeks' PRSI in the relevant tax year             before the year in which her maternity leave starts.
SMB is paid at 70% of average weekly earnings, subject to certain             maximum and minimum amounts.
Daily breaks for breastfeeding - There is at present a Government             commitment to introducing some measure of provision for             breastfeeding breaks in the workplace.
Parental leave
Parental leave is regulated by the Parental Leave Act 1998, which came into effect on             December 3, 1998.
Each parent is entitled to 14 weeks parental leave in respect of             each child born or adopted on or after 3 June (now 3 December             1993).
The leave must be taken in order to take care of the child, and any             abuse of this can lead to the leave being terminated.
Parental leave is not transferable between parents.
The 14 weeks may be taken as a continuous block or, by agreement             with the employer, in separate blocks or by working reduced hours.
Parental leave is unpaid but time spent on leave is reckonable for             all employment rights purposes other than superannuation.
Employers may postpone parental leave for up to six months in             certain circumstances.
Three days force majeure  leave may be taken in any one year             for a family crisis where the employees presence is indispensable.
Not more than five days of force majeure  leave may be taken             in any three year period.
Employers may give leave in a manner more favourable to employees             than the minimum required under the Act.
Disputes under the Act may be referred to a Rights Commissioner.
Section 6 provides the basic entitlement to parental leave.              It states that an employee who is the natural or adoptive parent of             a child is entitled to 14 working weeks leave to enable him or her             to take care of the child. The bill had only made provision for             parental leave without pay, but this last phrase was deleted             during the Dail debates as it was suggested that those words could             have prevented local agreements on parental leave with pay.              Thus, the entitlement carries no right to pay, but the Act does not             prohibit the granting of paid leave by individual organisations.
In the Act, the entitlement to leave originally only applied in             respect of children born on or after June 3, 1996 (or whose             adoption order was made on/after that date), but the leave could be             taken until the child reached the age of 5 years (or where a child             has been adopted between the ages of 3 and 8, within two years of             making the adoption order).  However, following a recent             amendment to the Act, eligibility for parental leave is now             expanded to include children born or adopted between December 3,             1993 and June 2, 1996.  All leave in respect of children born             or adopted during this period must be taken by December 31, 2001.
An employee must have worked for at least one year with the same             employer before being able to take such leave, and is entitled to             parental leave in respect of each child of which he or she is the             natural or adoptive parent.  This entitlement is             non-transferable; it attaches separately to each parent.
Section 7 provides that the leave may consist of a continuous             period of 14 weeks, or with the agreement of the employer, a number             of periods broken down either into days or hours or a combination             of both.  This means that the general entitlement is to have             one unbroken period of leave.  In other words, it may only be             broken into smaller periods at the option of the employer. The             section also provides that where an employee is entitled to             parental leave in respect of more than one child, and the children             concerned are not children of a multiple birth, the period of             parental leave taken by that parent in any one period of 12 months             must not without the employers consent exceed the 14 weeks.              This means that parents of twins or triplets or other multiple             births may take 14 weeks in respect of each child, even if this             amounts to more than 14 weeks in one 12 month period.  This             exception for multiple births was added during the Dail debates on             the bill. Section 7 also describes how the leave is to be             calculated; if it is done by hourly calculations, the number of             hours is calculated according to the number of hours during which             the employee worked in the continuous 14 week period just before             the commencement of the leave. The employee is entitled to 14 weeks             leave, exclusive of holidays, or time spent on maternity leave,             adoptive leave or sick leave.
Sick leave
There is no legislation governing sick leave; and no statutory             obligation on employers to pay employees while they are absent on             sick leave. However, if there is a sick pay scheme in operation in             the workplace, details of it should be included in the employee's             contract of employment as the employee will then have a contractual             right to such payment. Despite the absence of any statutory             obligation, many organisations operate sick leave/sick pay schemes.             The type of scheme varies considerably across different             organisations, but generally, schemes will provide for full pay for             some limited period of absence, and thereafter for half pay for a             further period. A typical scheme might provide for sick pay for up             to three months and half pay for a further three months. Pay is             generally inclusive of any social welfare payments to which the             employee is entitled; but in practice many employers continue to             pay employees their normal salary while on sick leave, and the             employees refund the company any social welfare cheques that they             receive.
Other special leave
Force Majeure  leave is provided for in the Parental Leave Act 1998. Section 13 provides for an entitlement to up to three             days force majeure  leave with pay per 12 month period (not             to exceed five days in any three year period).  Such an             entitlement arises where urgent family reasons, owing to an             injury or the illness of a child, spouse or partner, brother or             sister, parent or grandparent, have arisen, such that the             employee' immediate presence is indispensable, at the place where             that person is.  The place is not defined; it does not have to             be the employees own home, but could for example be a nursing             home, creche or hospital. Nor are the categories of what might be             described as dependent person exhaustive; the section says that             the Minister may in future provide for other categories of person             to be included.
Educational leave
There is no statutory obligation on employers to provide this type             of leave; where it is done, it is entirely at the discretion of the             employer.
Leave for trade union purposes or because of the holding of             public office
There is no statutory obligation on an employer to provide such             leave, although in practice reasonable requests for such leave             should be granted.
The statutory minimum age is 16 years old, except for
combined work training and placement/in plant training schemes,
light work not interfering with school/training programme and             cultural,
artistic, sports and advertising activities. 
Beyond this age and so far as a worker is aged less than 18 years             old he or she are protected under the Protection of Young Persons             (Employment) Act 1996.  This law provides for   minimum             rest and break periods for young persons and children.  It             also establishes strict limits  to night work for children and             young persons, and it obliges employers to ensure that young people             have working conditions which suit their age, including protection             against economic exploitation. Also, employers are obliged to             ensure that young persons are not engaged in work likely to harm             safety, health or development/education.
Breach by an employer of the provisions of the Act is a criminal             offence with a maximum fine of £1,500.  However, there is also             a limited remedy before a Rights Commissioner for a parent/guardian             or young person in respect of certain breaches by the employer -             failure by the employer to preserve the pay and conditions of young             persons/children employed prior to the Act coming into force             (Section 13) and breach of Section 17 where an employee is             penalised for refusing to co-operate with the employer breaching             the Act.

It includes a disability which                 exists at present, previously existed but no longer exists; or              may exist in future or is imputed to a person (eg HIV+, stroke,              heart                 attack, dementia...)
Harassment
Sexual harassment is defined by Section 23(3) of the Employment             Equality Act, 1998. Under this law, sexual harassment can be any             act of physical intimacy, request for sexual favours, or other act             or conduct (including spoken words, gestures, or the production,             display or circulation of written words, pictures or other             material). Such act or conduct must be unwelcome to the person             harassed and also reasonably capable of being regarded either             sexually or on the gender ground as offensive, humiliating or             intimidating to him or her.
Section 32 prohibits harassment 'in relation to' any of the other             specified grounds of discrimination, such as religion, age,             disability, sexual orientation or race. Harassment in section 32(5)             is defined as any act or conduct which is both unwelcome to the             complainant, and could reasonably be regarded, in relation to the             relevant characteristic of the person harassed, as offensive,             humiliating or intimidating to that person. Subsection (1) of each             section states that harassment constitutes discrimination where it             is perpetrated by a fellow employee, an employer or a client,             customer or other business contact of the employer, in             circumstances such that the employer 'ought reasonably to have             taken steps to prevent' the harassment.
The definition of harassment provided in each section is therefore             one which combines subjective and objective tests, since the             conduct must be both unwelcome to the recipient and  reasonably capable of being regarded as 'offensive, humiliating or             intimidating to them. To a large extent this is in keeping with             previous Labour Court judgments which had recognised sexual             harassment as actionable, despite the absence of any explicit             reference to sexual harassment in the 1977 Employment Equality Act.             The Court took a creative view, construing sexual harassment as             constituting discriminatory conditions of employment in breach of             section 3(4) of the 1977 Act. The landmark decision recognising             harassment as a form of discrimination was that in A Garage             Proprietor v. A Worker  in 1985, where a fifteen-year old female             petrol pump attendant had suffered continual sexual harassment,             verbal and physical, from her employer. The Labour Court stated             that 'freedom from sexual harassment is a condition of work which             an employee of either sex is entitled to expect. The Court will,             accordingly, treat any denial of that freedom as discrimination             within the meaning of the Employment Equality Act, 1977.
Thus, although an employer             may not be personally or physically responsible for the harassment             itself, the employer is legally responsible for the environment or             conditions under which employees work. 
The boundaries in this area were extended with the decision in A Limited Company v. One Female Employee , a case involving a             residential training programme that took place in a hotel away from             the workplace.
The             claimant had returned to her hotel room to find it ransacked and             her personal belongings littered in a sexually disturbing and             suggestive manner. Fellow employees from senior management             positions had been responsible for what they described as a             'prank'. The Equality Officer considered that the events             constituted discrimination within the meaning of the Act. It was             therefore established that harassment may occur outside the work             place, and that in order to constitute actionable discrimination,             it need not be overt or physical but can manifest itself in a more             subtle manner.
Successful claims have also been made by male employees against             female employers. In one 1992 decision, a claim by a young male             apprentice that he was the subject of sexual harassment in             employment was upheld by the Equality Officer, where he had been             subjected to crude and offensive sexual comments.
, the             Labour Court held that the employer was responsible for harassment             of an employee by a visitor to the premises, because the visitor             was there with the consent and acquiescence of the employer, who             had a duty to protect the worker and provide an environment free             from discrimination.  The Court also indicated that sexual             harassment can arise in relation to two persons of the same             sex.  In this case the employee alleging harassment ultimately             resigned her employment due to the circumstances, and this             constituted a constructive dismissal.
Measures to combat discrimination at work
These are all contained in the Employment Equality Act 1998, which             prohibits both direct and indirect discrimination on any of the             nine discriminatory grounds, in pay and other areas of employment.
Section 6 provides that discrimination occurs where, on one of the             nine discriminatory grounds, a person is treated less favourably             than another is, has been or would be treated. Discrimination is             forbidden in relation both to pay (remuneration), and in relation             to a range of non-pay issues.
Equal Pay
Sections 19 and 29 provide that persons of different categories             employed by the same or an associated employer on 'like work' shall             be entitled to the same rate of remuneration.
'Remuneration' is defined to include all consideration, in cash or             kind, except pension rights. It would include company cars, lunch             vouchers, or an overtime allowance. The 'same place' requirement is             removed.
(i)                        Definition of 'Like Work'
(a) the same work under the same or similar conditions;
(b) work of a similar nature, any differences being of small             importance;
(c) work that is equal in value, having regard to skill, mental or             physical requirements, responsibility and working conditions.
(ii)        Indirect Pay             Discrimination
This is expressly forbidden for the first time. It is now defined             in sections 19 (gender) and 29 (other grounds), as follows:
Section 19 (gender)
(a) a term or criterion is applied to all employees, in such a way               that those who fulfil the term or criterion receive different               remuneration from those who do not;
(b) the proportion of employees who are disadvantaged by the term               or criterion is substantially higher in the case of employees of               one sex than those of the other;
(c) the term or criterion cannot be justified by objective factors               unrelated to sex.
Section 29 (other grounds)
(a) a term or criterion is applied to all employees, in such a way               that those who fulfil the term or criterion receive different               remuneration from those who do not;
(b) the proportion of employees who can fulfil the term or               criterion is substantially smaller in the case of those from one               group when compared with those of the other group;
(c) the term or criterion cannot be justified as being reasonable               in all the circumstances.
(iii)            'Objective              Factors Unrelated to Sex'
There are slightly different tests for indirect discrimination used             in relation to gender claims as opposed to claims on other             discrimination grounds. The 'objective factors unrelated to sex' is the ECJ-approved test, which replaces the slightly more nebulous             test in section 2(3) of the 1974 Act, of 'grounds other than             sex.'  It might be predicted that it will be easier for             employers to prove that a term was reasonable in all the             circumstances, than it will be to prove that objective factors             unrelated to sex existed, but this remains to be seen. However,             some of the case law on the old provisions on indirect pay             discrimination may still be useful.
The best-known recent decision in Ireland on indirect pay             discrimination is that in the Penneys pay claim, Mandate v.             Penneys, HC, March 1999 , where historical differences in             pay-bargaining procedures were successfully relied upon by Penneys             to justify different pay rates for a group of 550 mainly female             sales and clerical assistants, and a group of 11 male storemen. The             work of both groups was found to be equal in value, but the larger             group had relied upon their union negotiating pay rates with IBEC,             whereas the smaller group had negotiated directly with Penneys             management. This is the sort of practice that could still now be             covered under the heading of 'objective factors unrelated to sex.'
In relation to grounds other than gender, section 34(1) provides             that benefits may still be provided by employers in respect of             changes in marital status; events related to the family of the             employee; or to assist in the care of dependants for those             employees with family status. Section 34(6) also provides that a             further period of 3 years after section 29 of the Act has come into             force is allowed for any existing practice of age-related             remuneration to cease; and that in any case it is not regarded as             age-based discrimination to pay different rates according to             seniority or length of service.
Non-Pay Discrimination
Sections 8 and 10 provide that discrimination on any of             discriminatory grounds is forbidden in relation to advertising of             posts, access to employment, conditions of employment, training or             experience, promotion or re-grading, classification of posts. Both             direct and indirect non-pay discrimination are prohibited.
(i)         Indirect             Discrimination
This is defined in section 22 and 31 of the Act (22 relates to             gender; 31 to the other grounds), as follows: Section 22 (gender)
(a) a provision is applied to the claimant and comparator;
(b) the proportion of persons disadvantaged by the provision is             substantially higher in the case of those of one sex than in the             case of those of the other sex;
(c) the provision cannot be justified by objective factors             unrelated to the sex of the claimant.
Section 31 (other grounds) (a) a provision applies to employees             including the claimant and comparator;
(b) it operates to the disadvantage of the claimant, as compared to             the comparator, in relation to access, promotion, etc.;
(c) it can be complied with by a substantially smaller proportion             of employees sharing the claimant's characteristics when compared             with those sharing the comparator's characteristics;
(d) it cannot be justified as being reasonable in all the             circumstances of the case.
Again, slightly different tests are used depending on whether the             claim is gender-based or not. But, again similar defences are             provided of 'objective factors unrelated to sex' and             'reasonableness'. The concept of proportionality, which was             introduced into indirect discrimination cases by the definition in             the 1977 Act, remains in place in these definitions. Statistics may             typically be relied upon in these cases.
2000 and introduced a National Minimum Wage for the             first time in Ireland. Many low paid workers benefited from its             introduction, particularly women, young people and part-time             workers. An increase in the National Minimum Wage came into effect             on July 1, 2001, the first of two increases to the national minimum             wage agreed by the social partners and accepted by the Government             as part of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness (PPF). The             National Minimum Wage is now £4.70 (5.97) per hour. From October             1, 2002 it will increase to £5.00 (6.35) per hour.
Wage-fixing machinery
Wages are fixed through a series of nationally-negotiated pay             agreements based upon a social partnership model. Every three years             the Government, representatives of the trade union movement, of             employers' organisations and more recently also drawn from the             non-governmental 'social pillar' (ie voluntary groups) come             together to negotiate a national agreement which fixes wage             increases and other payments generally. The agreement also sets a             framework for a wide range of government policies, ranging from,             for example, education to national infrastructural development. The             most recent of these is the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness             (PPF).
Protection of wages
The             Act regulates the mode and method of payment to employees
Establishes a range of acceptable modes of payment
Outlines the circumstances where reductions from pay by the             employer are permissible
Protects the right of employees who prior to the coming into             operation of the Act were being paid in cash or some other legal             method by providing that a change in the mode of payment can only             be achieved by agreement between employer and employee.
Protection of Workers' Claims in Case of Insolvency of their             Employer
The financial position of employees who lose their jobs as a result             of employer insolvency is protected under the Protection of             Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act 1984. The Act results from an             EC Directive 80/087/EEC which came into force in Ireland on 22             October 1983, and applies to all insolvencies after that date.
Insolvency ' is defined as occurring where the employer is an             individual, where he or she has been adjudicated bankrupt, or has             filed a petition for or has executed a deed of arrangement with             their creditors, or if they have died and the estate is insolvent.             Where the employer is a company, insolvent  is defined as             occurring where the company is in liquidation or receivership, that             is where it has either been wound up or where a receiver has been             appointed to supervise the payment of creditors. An employer may             also be deemed to be insolvent where they have ceased trading, even             where no formal bankruptcy or winding- up proceedings have been             initiated.
Employees' rights are protected in the event of insolvency in that             any money owing to them by the employer in terms of remuneration,             holiday pay, sick pay, monies in lieu of notice, or money owing             under any recommendation or order made against the employer in             respect of unfair dismissal, maternity or parental leave claims.             Pension payments are also covered subject to a ceiling and time             limits. The employee may be designated as a preferred             creditor  although debts owed to them rank behind the expenses             of the liquidator or receiver, and any taxes owing to the Revenue             Commissioners. In any event, the employee may apply to the Minister             on the prescribed form and the Minister shall pay the debts owed,             once the Minister is satisfied that the employee falls within the             definition of theAct and the employer has become insolvent after 22             October 1983; and that on the 'relevant date' the employee was             entitled to be paid the whole or part of any debt.
The payments are made out of the Social Insurance Fund, which is             funded by employer PRSI payments. Further technical matters             relating to payments are covered by the Protection of Employees             (Employers' Insolvency) (Variation of Limit) Regulations 1994 (SI             No. 17 of 1990, as amended by SI 62/1994).
Trade union regulation
The pattern favoured in the law throughout much of the last century             was apparent from the two major pieces of legislation regulating             trade union structures and organisation passed in Irish law prior             to the last decade: the Trade Union Act 1941 and the Industrial             Relations Act 1946. The 1941 Act, as subsequently amended, was             concerned primarily with the problem of multiplicity of unions,             seeking to tackle it by discouraging the formation of new trade             unions and encouraging the merger of existing ones. The 1946 Act             was concerned more generally with industrial relations, enshrining             the principle of free collective bargaining, ensuring that the             State's role in the collective bargaining process remained an             auxiliary one. Since the commencement of the national centralised             'social partnership' process, the State's role in collective             bargaining has clearly increased significantly.  But in terms             of trade union pattern, the policy remains one of discouraging a             multiplicity of unions.
Prevailing patterns in practice
In 1980 trade union density (the percentage of those in employment             who were union members) stood at 61.8%. By 1990 this figure had             shrunk to an estimated 54.6%. Today the comparable figure is either             39.2% using figures from the ICTU or  42.05% based on LRC             data. Using either set of figures we can see that union density has             dropped by 50%, from 60% of the workforce to 40%. In the private             sector union density stands at around 28%, or just over a quarter             of the 1m workers employed by private sector companies.
This downward trend in trade union membership is not unique to             Ireland. Recent data published in the European Journal of             Industrial Relations  (Vol. 6 No. 2 July 2000) shows the picture             across Europe. In looking at these figures, it should also be             remembered that in many European countries many more employees than             are union members are covered by collectively negotiated agreements             because of the sectoral or national application of such agreements,             often by law.
From an Irish trade union perspective, what is worrying about the             membership figures is that union density is decreasing during a             period of strong employment growth. In the past, union membership             and density has tended to increase during robust periods of             economic growth. If present trends continue, then within the next             five years union membership in the private sector will drop below             20% and could be fast approaching 15%. Unions have not actual lost             members; membership simply has not grown at the same rate as             employment growth.
There are a number of reasons to explain the drop in density. In             part it derives from the decline of traditional, mass-manufacturing             companies, with predominantly male workforces, which were the             heartlands of the trade unions. It has been suggested by some             commentators that the density drop results almost exclusively from             the failure of the trade unions to build membership in the new             growth sectors, such as computers, informational technology,             telecommunications and financial services, especially in overseas             companies investing in this country.
The right of not to join a union
The Irish Constitution in Article 40.6.1(iii) guarantees: The             right of citizens to form associations and unions  This             constitutional right has been held, in Educational Company v.             Fitzpatrick [1961] IR 323 , for example, to include the right of             any citizen not to join associations or unions if they so wish.
The case of Meskell v CIE [1973] IR 121  held that to try to             alter the constitutional rights of an employee retrospectively by             enforcing a closed shop agreement on current employees was             unconstitutional. This decision did not affect the rights of             workers who join an employment which already has a pre-entry closed             shop agreement, as the employee will know in advance that trade             union membership of a particular union is an employment             requirement. Such a condition of employment is not regarded as             unconstitutional as neither compulsion nor coercion on the employee             is involved - though it has to be said that these contentions have             not been fully tested in the Courts.
Collection of union dues by check-off
The Payment of Wages Act 1991 allows deduction from wages of union             dues or other payments, provided there is an agreement to do so in             the Contract of Employment and the employee has been notified of             the deduction. This is a usual practice in Ireland.
Registration and recognition of unions
Although many types of unions exist, from in-house staff             associations to national bodies, and registration/authorisation is not obligatory, there are certain advantages to be gained from             being an authorised trade union, particularly since the enactment             of the Industrial Relations Act 1990. That Act provides for certain             immunities from liability for trade unions involved in trade             disputes, but these apply only in relation to 'authorised trade             unions which for the time being are holders of negotiation licences             under the Trade Union Act, 1941.'The 1941 Act provides for various             restrictions on the granting and retention of such licences, which             are designed to hinder any attempts to create new unions. The             restrictions vary in accordance with the category of union to which             the applicant union belongs.
The legal situation with regard to trade union recognition is that             an employer does not have to recognise or bargain with a union.
In Abbott and Whelan v ITGWU and the Southern Health Board             (1982) 1 JISLL 56,  Mr. Justice McWilliams held that: The             suggestionthat there is a constitutional right to be represented             by a union in the conduct of negotiations with employersin my             opinion could not be sustained. There is no duty placed on an             employer to negotiate with any particular citizen or body of             citizens. In 1981, Mr. Justice Hamilton, in Dublin Colleges ASA             v City of Dublin VEC (1982) 1 JISLL 73,  where a number of             teachers had formed a new union of their own and sought formal             recognition said the plaintiffs naturally had a constitutional             right of association:But (there is) no corresponding obligation on             any body or person, such as the defendants herein, to recognize             that association for the purpose of negotiating the terms and             conditions of employment of its members, or for any purpose.
The same point had been made in even stronger language by Mr.             Justice Walsh in EI & Company Ltd v Kennedy [1968] IR             69 :In law an employer is not obliged to meet anybody as the             representative of his workers, nor indeed is he obliged to meet the             worker himself for the purpose of discussing any demand which the             worker may make.The position was summarised by the late Professor             John Kelly in his authoritative work on the Irish Constitution.             According to Professor Kelly: The right of association of             employees does not imply any duty on an employer beyond respecting             the right in itself, and of course discharging his side of any             agreement with employees. In particular, it does not oblige him to             negotiate with any association which employees may form.
Nevertheless, the Courts have held that disputes over recognition             are valid trade disputes. The Industrial Relations Act 1990 gives             disputes over recognition immunity from action in relation to any             torturous act committed by or on behalf of the trade union in             contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute, provided they             comply with certain stated statutory requirements.
Remedies where an employer refuses to recognise a union
  In an attempt to meet trade union concerns over the ability             of employers to avoid union recognition the government recently             enacted legislation, the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001             came into force on May 31, 2001. It is   based on an agreed             report from the social partners and relevant state agencies             concerned with industrial relations issues. The new legislation             gives the Labour Court the power to issue a legally binding ruling             on pay and conditions of employment in circumstances in which an             employer refuses to recognise a trade union. However, the Court             cannot rule that an employer must recognise a trade union.              Further, the procedure set out in the Act is long and cumbersome,             possibly taking up to two years to complete, and has not yet been             tested in practice.
Trade union membership and recognition is an important issue in             Ireland, particularly because Irish legislation contains no erga             omnes  provisions whereby collective bargaining agreements are             applied across sectors on a binding basis. Therefore, in Ireland,             collective bargaining coverage is synonymous with union membership.             As union density currently stands at around 40% (broken down as             between around 80% in the public sector and 25% in the private             sector) this means that around 60% of Irish workers have their pay             and conditions unilaterally set by management, or as a result of             individual negotiations. Further, because of the fact that the             Irish Labour Inspectorate (which is seriously understaffed)             operates on a reactive basis  i.e. they respond largely to             complaints rather than proactively inspecting employers to ensure             that employment laws are being adhered to  workers who, in theory,             appear to be well protected, in reality may be inadequately             protected or not protected at all.
Unfair labour practices
The concept of unfair labour practices  does not exist as             such. However, through the employment legislation detailed above             employers are obliged to act fairly towards their employees in a             range of different ways. The Labour Relations Commission has             published a range of Codes setting out best practice in different             areas, for example on disciplinary and grievance procedures.
Collective bargaining regulation
The Trade Union Act 1941 identifies the primary function of a trade             union as the carrying on of negotiations for the fixing of wages             and other conditions of employment - the carrying on of such             negotiations with employers is known as collective bargaining.             Since the foundation of the State, with the exception of the             limited period 1941-46 and certain temporary legislation with             respect to the banks in 1973, 1975 and 1976, trade unions and             employers have been free to bargain over wages and other conditions             of employment without the intervention of the law.
Structure and levels of collective bargaining
Although collective bargaining has been based traditionally on the             British voluntarist model and has not been subject to legal             regulation (see above), a major feature of Irish industrial             relations is the system of centralised wage bargaining which first             began in 1948 with the first of a series of wage rounds. Between             1970-82, wage trends were determined by successive National Wage             Agreements, which became National Understandings for Economic and             Social Development, and have since become the more formalised             Social Partnership Agreements (the present one is the PPF, or             Programme for Prosperity and Fairness).
These Agreements or Programmes are negotiated at a national level,             but local agreements may still be reached, and this is generally             done informally. At present, local collective agreements are             not binding due to the policy of voluntarism or exclusion of the             courts, which is central to collective bargaining and industrial             relations practice in Ireland. Whereas it is possible for             collective agreements to be registered with the Labour Court, they             seldom are in practice. If it is desired, then the parties to a             Collective Agreement may apply to the Labour Court to register the             Agreement. Once the Agreement is registered and any subsequent             amendments notified, the Agreement is legally enforceable.
The parties to collective bargaining
At national level: the Government, representatives of the                 trade union movement, of employers' organisations and more recently                 also                 drawn from the non-governmental 'social pillar' (ie voluntary                 groups).
At local level: employers/employers' organisations and employee                 representative bodies.
Negotiation procedures
These are informal, and are not regulated by law. However, the             Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 gives a more formalised role             for collective agreements, allowing flexibility to be reached in             the application of the Act through the negotiation of collective             agreements. For example, the normal reference period over which the             maximum 48-hour working week is calculated is 6 months, but this             can instead be calculated over 12 months, where an employer             concludes a collective agreement with the workforce, which is             approved and registered by the Labour Court under section 24 of the             Act. Collective agreements also allow greater flexibility in the             scheduling of daily and weekly rest breaks, and the management of             night work.
The Act thus gives greater importance to collective agreements, but             technically speaking, collective agreements do not provide a way             around the Act. Instead, they may provide for more flexibility             within the operation of the Act. Section 2(1) defines collective             agreement. "an agreement by or on behalf of an employer on the one             hand, and by or on behalf of a body or bodies representative of the             employees to whom the agreement relates on the other hand."
Thus, they do not have to be union-employer agreements. They may be             concluded between an employer and an internal staff association.             The procedure for concluding flexibility collective agreements is             provided for under section 24 of the Act, as follows:
A collective agreement is concluded;
It is submitted to the Labour Court for approval.
The Labour Court registers the agreement if approved.
Effects of collective agreements
Collective agreements are  generally not binding on the             parties. The terms of an agreement may, however, be binding on the             workers and employers included within the agreement's scope but             only to the extent that they are deemed to have been 'incorporated'             into the employees' individual contracts of employment.
Where an agreement is concluded in a workplace, it will usually be             applied to all employees in the organisation whether they are union             members or not. The legality of this informal arrangement has,             however, not been tested in the courts.
Duration of agreements  varies.
Workers' representation in the enterprise
Representation of workers is either organised through trade unions,             or organised on an informal basis, or not organised at all. Until             EU legislation comes into effect, there is no obligation on the             employer to have a mechanism for the representation of workers in             Irish law.
Strikes and lock outs
The legal framework for strike action is made up by a combination             of law,  collective agreements and case law or a combination. The             Industrial Relations Act 1990 is now the             governing statute in this area, and has been in force since July             1990.  The objective of the Act was to reform the law in             relation to trade disputes and Industrial Relation Institutions -             to create a better framework/climate for dispute resolution and to             incorporate some amendments in relation to trade union Law.
Prior to the 1990 Act, the right to strike and the law pursuant to             Trade disputes was enshrined in the Trade Disputes Act 1906. This             Act granted certain legal immunities to persons engaged in a lawful             trade dispute.  These immunities are, to a large extent,             preserved in the 1990 Act - the changes are designed to place             observance of certain procedures as a precondition before the legal             immunities will apply.
The Act defines "industrial action" as "any action which affects,             or is likely to affect, the terms or conditions, whether express or             implied, of a contract and which is taken by any number or body of             workers acting in combination or under a common understanding as a             means of compelling their employer, or to aid other workersin             compelling their employer, to accept or not to accept terms or             conditions of or affecting employment".
"Strike" is defined as meaning  "a cessation of work by any             number or body of workers acting in combination or a concerted             refusal or a refusal under a common understanding of any number of             workers to continue to work for their employer done as a means of             compelling their employer, or to aid other workers in compelling             their employer, to accept or not to accept terms or conditions of             or affecting employment."
Section10 of the 1990 Act confers immunity from prosecution or             civil action for conspiracy where workers are taking industrial             action in "contemplation of furtherance" of a trade dispute.             Section11 deals with immunity in relation to picketing including             secondary picketing and provides that it shall be lawful to engage             in peaceful picketing at that employees place of work if the             picketing is in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute and             designed to peacefully obtain or communicate information or to             peacefully persuade persons from abstaining from working.
With regard to secondary picketing (picketing at place of work of             an employer who is not a party to the dispute) this is lawful only             if those picketing have reasonable grounds to believe that the             employer whose place of work is being picketed has or is directly             assisting their own employer with a view to frustrating the strike             or industrial action.
Section12 provides immunity to persons acting in contemplation or             furtherance of a trade dispute in relation to actions for breach of             contract of employment, inducement to others to breach their             contact or a threat to breach the contract of employment (a             threatened strike). Section13 provides immunity for actions in Tort             (civil wrong) against Trade Unions, members of and Trade Union             Officials provided their actions were taken in contemplation or             furtherance of a trade dispute or with reasonable belief that they             were in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute.
Who can convene a strike?
Anyone may convene a strike, but the protection against liability             only applies to trade unions which convene a strike under certain             procedural requirements imposed upon unions by the Act, with regard             to taking lawful strike action.
Pre-requisites for strike action
Sections 14 and 19 of the Act require trade unions to ballot             members in a secret ballot before organising or sanctioning             industrial action in contemplation or furtherance of a trade             dispute.  If such ballot favours industrial action the union             must give the employer one week notice of the intention to take             industrial action.  If the union complies with this             requirement the employer is precluded from seeking an ex pate             (interim) injunction.  The employer may still apply for an             interlocutory injunction but section 19(2) provides that the Court             will not grant the injunction where the Union establishes a fair             case that they were acting in contemplation or furtherance of a             trade dispute.
These protections are not available if the trade union fails to             comply with the secret ballot and notice requirements and the             detailed requirements in section 4(2), as follows:
The trade union must:
Have a provision in their rule book for holding of a secret ballot                   where industrial action is contemplated.
So far as is practicable, accord the right to vote to all members                   who it is envisaged will be required to participate in the              action.
Take steps to ensure there is no intimidation or influence on                   voting intentions.
Refrain from organising or sanctioning industrial action against                   the vote of the secret ballot.
Section 9 of the Industrial Relations Act 1990 would appear to             deprive employees of the immunity against suit and protection             against an injunction in relation to picketing where certain             conditions apply.  If the dispute is in relation to the             employment/non-employment or conditions of employment of an             individual and the employee(s)/union involved have not              exhausted all the procedures established by custom and practice             or detailed in a Collective Agreement in relation to the processing             of industrial grievances.  This would appear to require an             individual employee to  process a dispute in relation to             dismissal right through to the E.A.T. before industrial action             could be taken with the protections.  The employer however is             also obliged to adhere to procedures - section9(3) provides that             where the employer refuses to comply with procedures, the employee             will be deemed to have exhausted such procedures.
With regard to trade disputes which are not individual worker             disputes, the Act is silent as to whether the union or the             employees must exhaust procedures set down in a Collective             Agreement before strike action is taken.  Certainly they must             comply with the secret ballot/notice requirements.  However,             it would also appear that if a Collective Agreement is incorporated             into an individual employees contract and is thereby legally             enforceable or is a Registered agreement the immunities in sections             12/S.13 may not be available if the action was taken without             firstly exhausting the agreed dispute procedures in the Collective             Agreement.
Strikes in essential services
Although the general criminal liability for breach of the contract             of employment (such as through strike action) was abolished by the             Employers and Workmen Act 1875, sections 4 and 5 of the Conspiracy             and Protection of Property Act 1875 provide that breaches of the             contract of employment will be illegal in two situations. First,             where the breach is by persons employed in certain public             utilities, and secondly, where the breach is likely to involve             serious injury to any person or property. Section 4 imposes             criminal liability on persons employed by municipal authority or             any gas or water supplier who breaks their contract. This provision             was extended to electricity workers by section 110 of the             Electricity Supply Act 1927.
Section 5 is broader and could potentially apply to other             categories of essential service workers, such as hospital workers,             fire brigade staff or security staff. It provides that breaching of             contract is a criminal offence where the probable consequences are             to 'endanger human life, or cause serious bodily injury, or to             expose valuable property whether real or personal to destruction or             serious injury.' Finally, other specific legislation applies eg to             those who incite or encourage persons employed by the State to go             on strike; or who induce members of the Gardai to go on strike, and             further legislation applies to postal workers who go on strike.
Effects of legal and illegal strikes
Where a strike is deemed to be illegal, the employer may obtain an             injunction against the union. An injunction is a court order which             requires a person to do or to refrain from doing certain             acts.  It is a temporary order designed to preserve the status             quo until the action (case) comes to trial.  Trade disputes             have been a fertile ground for employers to seek injunctions to             restrain picketing.  An employer successfully restraining             picketing will often gain advantage in bargaining power and the             result of the injunction will often lead to the end of the             dispute.  In relation to trade disputes, two types of             injunction have been sought (1) "the interim injunction" or "ex             parte injunction" sought as a matter of urgency and without notice             to the other party.  It is a very temporary order and a             further application for an interlocutory injunction must be made             within days.
Secondly, there is the interlocutory injunction, the procedure for             which is as follows: Both sides are notified and the order, if             granted, will be for a longer period but still temporary in             nature.  The injunction is granted on the following basis:
The party seeking the order must establish that there is a fair                 question to be raised which requires a full Court hearing.
That pending the trial, irreparable or substantial damage will              be caused to them and that the balance of convenience lies with                 granting the injunction.
The 1990 Act introduced restrictions on the employers rights to             obtain injunctions and cushioned these changes by placing             procedural requirements on unions with regard to taking lawful             strike action.
Lock outs
Lockouts are not included in the definition of "strike" or             "industrial action" under the Industrial Relations Act 1990, so are             not regulated at the collective level. Rather, they are regulated             at the individual employee level, under the Unfair Dismissals Acts             1977-93. If at the end of a lockout, an employee is not reinstated             or re-engaged, and one or more others who were also locked out were             reinstated or re-engaged, it would then be considered an unfair             dismissal.
The 1993 Act amended the 1977 Act to provide that the dismissal of             an employee for taking part in a strike or industrial action is an             unfair dismissal if at least one other employee was not dismissed             for the same action, or if another employee was reinstated or             re-engaged. The date of reinstatement or re-engagement is the date             as agreed between the employer and employees, or if there is no             agreement, the date on which reinstatement or re-engagement was             offered to the majority of the workforce. If a particular employee             is dismissed for taking part in a strike and other employees are             not so dismissed, it would be an automatically unfair dismissal.             However, if during the course of the strike or other industrial             action, there was abusive behaviour by an employee, he or she could             be deemed to be fairly dismissed for that reason.
Settlement of labour disputes
Labour law matters are generally not dealt with through the             ordinary courts structures, but rather through a specialist             structure of labour institutions: the Labour Relations Commission,             Rights Commissioners, the Director of Equality Investigations, the             Labour Court and the Employment Appeals Tribunal. Although labour             law is often divided between collective and individual branches,             this division is not reflected in the functions reserved to each of             the labour institutions. The Labour Court, for example, was set up             as a collective and voluntarist institution with a primary role in             resolving trade disputes; but it has more recently been assigned             jurisdiction over equality law matters and hears appeals from the             Director of Equality Investigations under the Employment Equality             Act 1998. Claims involving breaches of other employment protection             legislation such as the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977-93, the             Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 or the Payment of Wages Act             1991 are all taken first to the Rights Commissioner and then to the             Employment Appeals Tribunal.
Labour Court
The Irish Labour             Court was established in 1946 (following the enactment             of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946). Its main functions were to             adjudicate in trade disputes and to provide a conciliation service.             Other functions given to the Court included the establishment of             Joint Labour Committees and the registration of employment             agreements and Joint Industrial Councils. There have been many             changes to its structure and functions since then, following             amendments to the Industrial Relations Act in 1969, 1976, 1990 and             2001, and the enactment of  other laws, such as the             Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, the Employment Equality Act,             1977, the Pensions Act, 1990, the Organisation of Working Time Act,             1997, the Employment Equality Act, 1998, the National Minimum Wage             Act, 2000, the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act, 2001.             An equality service was added in 1975 to deal with equal pay - and             later, equal treatment - cases. In 1991, this service, and the             conciliation service of the Labour Court were transferred to the             Labour Relations Commission. In 1999, the equality service was             transferred from the Labour Relations Commission to the newly             formed Equality Authority and Office of the Director of Equality             Investigations, (under the auspices of the Department of Justice,             Equality and Law Reform) under the Employment Equality Act, 1998.
The Labour Court is an independent body consisting of             representatives of employers and workers participating on an equal             basis. It consists of 9, full-time, members - a Chairman, 2 Deputy             Chairmen and 6 Ordinary Members, 3 of whom are Employers Members             and 3 of whom are Workers Members. It is not a court of law. It             operates as an industrial relations tribunal, hearing both sides in             trade disputes and then issuing Recommendations setting out its             opinion on the dispute and the terms on which it should be settled.             While these Recommendations are not binding on the parties             concerned, the parties are expected to give serious consideration             to the Courts Recommendation. Ultimately,however, responsibility             for the settlement of a dispute rests with the parties.
When dealing with cases involving breaches of registered employment             agreements,the Labour Court makes legally binding orders. Also, the             Courts determinations under the Employment Equality, Pensions,             Organisation of Working Time, National Minimum Wage and Protection             of Employees (Part-Time Work) Acts are legally binding.

Labour Relations Commission
The Labour Relations Commission (LRC) was established on 21             January, 1991 under section 24 of the Industrial Relations Act,             1990. The LRC is made up of a chairperson and six ordinary members,             of whom two are appointed by the Minister, two come from the             workers sides and two from employers side. The chairman shall be             appointed by the Minister after consultation with such             organisations as the Minister considers to be representative of             workers and of employers .
The Commission has general responsibility for promoting the             improvement of industrial relations. More specifically it :
( a ) provides a conciliation service;
( b ) provides an industrial relations advisory service;
( c ) prepares codes of practice relevant to industrial relations             after consultation with unions and employer organisations;
( d ) offer guidance on codes of practice and help to resolve             disputes concerning their implementation;
( e ) appoints equality officers of the Commission and provide             staff and facilities for the equality officer service;
( f ) select and nominate persons for appointment as rights             commissioners and provide staff and facilities for the rights             commissioner service;
( g ) conduct or commission research into matters relevant to             industrial relations;
( h ) review and monitor developments in the area of industrial             relations;
( i ) assists joint labour committees and joint industrial councils             in the exercise of their functions.
In addition to Senior Management, LRCs  staff includes             industrial relations officers (conciliation officers), rights             commissioners and advisory, development and research officers.
Conciliation is a voluntary process. The process of conciliation             begins when one or both disputing parties writes to the Labour             Relations Commission requesting assistance with their industrial relations dispute. According to LRCs data, conciliation is             succesful in over 80 per cent of cases that are referred to it for             conciliation. In case of failure  the parties have the option             of referring the dispute to the Labour Court for recommendation.
Rights Commissioners investigate disputes, grievances and claims             that individuals or small groups of workers refer under various             pieces of legislation, such as the Industrial Relations Act,             1969-1990, the Unfair Dismissals Acts,1977 -1993 , the Payment of             Wages Act, 1991, the Maternity Protection Act, 1994,             the   Protection of Young Persons ( Employment ) Act,             1998, the Organisation Of Working Time Act, 1997, etc.              However, a party to a dispute may object to a Rights Commissioners             investigation where the case has been referred under the Industrial             Relations Acts, 1969-1990 or under the Unfair Dismissals Acts,             1977-1993. Where such an objection is made, the Rights Commissioner             cannot investigate the case. The applicant can instead request the             Labour Court or, depending on the legislation, the Employment             Appeals Tribunal to hear the case.
After hearing the parties, rights commissioner issue the findings             of their investigations in the form of either non-binding             recommendations or decisions, depending on the legislation under             which a case is referred. These can be appealed, provided the             appeal is lodged within the time limits set down in the             legislation. The relevant Acts govern whether the appeal is to the             Labour Court or Employment Appeals Tribunal. Having heard the             appeal, the Court, or Tribunal, will issue a decision, which is             binding on the parties to the dispute.
Employment Appeals Tribunal
The Employment Appeals Tribunal is responsible for             implementing rights under protective employment law. It hears a             wide range of disputes concerning employment rights. It consists of             three people: a Chairperson who has legal qualifications and one             representative each from panels formed by the trade unions and             employer organisations.
The decision of the Tribunal is generally called a "determination"             and is legally binding. In most cases, the determination may             be  appealed to the High Court by either party but only on a             point of law. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment             also  has power to refer an issue to the High Court at the             request of the Tribunal.
Under the Unfair Dismissals Act and the Maternity  Protection             of Employees Act, either party may appeal to the Circuit Court             within 6 weeks of the determination (the appeal is  not             confined to a point of law). If no appeal is brought to the Circuit             Court and the employer does not implement the  determination,             the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment may bring             proceedings in the Circuit Court on behalf of the employee.
Finally, it should be reminded that legal issues involving Eurpean             Community Law may be referred by national courts to the European             Court of Justice, for a preliminary ruling under art. 234 EC             Treaty.

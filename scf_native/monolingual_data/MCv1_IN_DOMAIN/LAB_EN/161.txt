"Purpose." The purpose of this section is to provide employees and their designated representatives a right of access to relevant exposure and medical records; and to provide representatives of the Assistant Secretary a right of access to these records in order to fulfill responsibilities under the Occupational Safety and Health Act. Access by employees, their representatives, and the Assistant Secretary is necessary to yield both direct and indirect improvements in the detection, treatment, and prevention of occupational disease. Each employer is responsible for assuring compliance with this section, but the activities involved in complying with the access to medical records provisions can be carried out, on behalf of the employer, by the physician or other health care personnel in charge of employee medical records. Except as expressly provided, nothing in this section is intended to affect existing legal and ethical obligations concerning the maintenance and confidentiality of employee medical information, the duty to disclose information to a patient/employee or any other aspect of the medical-care relationship, or affect existing legal obligations concerning the protection of trade secret information.
1910.1020(b)(1)

1910.1020(e)(2)(ii)(C)
1910.1020(e)(2)(ii)(C)
1910.1020(e)(2)(ii)(C)
1910.1020(e)(2)(ii)(D)
Whenever an employee requests access to his or her employee medical records, and a physician representing the employer believes that direct employee access to information contained in the records regarding a specific diagnosis of a terminal illness or a psychiatric condition could be detrimental to the employee's health, the employer may inform the employee that access will only be provided to a designated representative of the employee having specific written consent, and deny the employee's request for direct access to this information only. Where a designated representative with specific written consent requests access to information so withheld, the employer shall assure the access of the designated representative to this information, even when it is known that the designated representative will give the information to the employee.
1910.1020(e)(2)(ii)(E)
A physician, nurse, or other responsible health care personnel maintaining employee medical records may delete from requested medical records the identity of a family member, personal friend, or fellow employee who has provided confidential information concerning an employee's health status.
1910.1020(e)(2)(iii)
1910.1020(e)(2)(iii)(A)
Each employer shall, upon request, assure the access of each employee and designated representative to each analysis using exposure or medical records concerning the employee's working conditions or workplace.
1910.1020(e)(2)(iii)(B)
Whenever access is requested to an analysis which reports the contents of employee medical records by either direct identifier (name, address, social security number, payroll number, etc.) or by information which could reasonably be used under the circumstances indirectly to identify specific employees (exact age, height, weight, race, sex, date of initial employment, job title, etc.), the employer shall assure that personal identifiers are removed before access is provided. If the employer can demonstrate that removal of personal identifiers from an analysis is not feasible, access to the personally identifiable portions of the analysis need not be provided.
1910.1020(e)(3)
1910.1020(e)(3)(i)
Each employer shall, upon request, and without derogation of any rights under the Constitution or the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, 29 U.S.C. 651 "et seq.," that the employer chooses to exercise, assure the prompt access of representatives of the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health to employee exposure and medical records and to analyses using exposure or medical records. Rules of agency practice and procedure governing OSHA access to employee medical records are contained in 29 CFR 1913.10.
1910.1020(e)(3)(ii)
Whenever OSHA seeks access to personally identifiable employee medical information by presenting to the employer a written access order pursuant to 29 CFR 1913.10(d), the employer shall prominently post a copy of the written access order and its accompanying cover letter for at least fifteen (15) working days.
1910.1020(f)
1910.1020(f)(1)
Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, nothing in this section precludes an employer from deleting from records requested by a health professional, employee, or designated representative any trade secret data which discloses manufacturing processes, or discloses the percentage of a chemical substance in mixture, as long as the health professional, employee, or designated representative is notified that information has been deleted. Whenever deletion of trade secret information substantially impairs evaluation of the place where or the time when exposure to a toxic substance or harmful physical agent occurred, the employer shall provide alternative information which is sufficient to permit the requesting party to identify where and when exposure occurred.
1910.1020(f)(2)
The employer may withhold the specific chemical identity, including the chemical name and other specific identification of a toxic substance from a disclosable record provided that:
1910.1020(f)(2)(i)
1910.1020(f)(2)(ii)
1910.1020(f)(2)(iii)
The employer informs the requesting party that the specific chemical identity is being withheld as a trade secret; and
1910.1020(f)(2)(iv)
The specific chemical identity is made available to health professionals, employees and designated representatives in accordance with the specific applicable provisions of this paragraph.
1910.1020(f)(3)
Where a treating physician or nurse determines that a medical emergency exists and the specific chemical identity of a toxic substance is necessary for emergency or first-aid treatment, the employer shall immediately disclose the specific chemical identity of a trade secret chemical to the treating physician or nurse, regardless of the existence of a written statement of need or a confidentiality agreement. The employer may require a written statement of need and confidentiality agreement, in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (f)(4) and (f)(5), as soon as circumstances permit.
1910.1020(f)(4)(i)
1910.1020(f)(4)(ii)(A)
1910.1020(f)(4)(ii)(B)
1910.1020(f)(4)(ii)(C)
1910.1020(f)(4)(ii)(D)
1910.1020(f)(4)(ii)(E)
1910.1020(f)(4)(ii)(F)
1910.1020(f)(4)(ii)(G)
1910.1020(f)(4)(iii)
The request explains in detail why the disclosure of the specific chemical identity is essential and that, in lieu thereof, the disclosure of the following information would not enable the health professional, employee or designated representative to provide the occupational health services described in paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section;
1910.1020(f)(4)(iii)(A)
1910.1020(f)(4)(iii)(B)
1910.1020(f)(4)(iii)(C)
1910.1020(f)(4)(iii)(D)
1910.1020(f)(4)(v)
The health professional, employee, or designated representative and the employer or contractor of the services of the health professional or designated representative agree in a written confidentiality agreement that the health professional, employee or designated representative will not use the trade secret information for any purpose other than the health need(s) asserted and agree not to release the information under any circumstances other than to OSHA, as provided in paragraph (f)(7) of this section, except as authorized by the terms of the agreement or by the employer.
1910.1020(f)(5)
1910.1020(f)(5)(i)
May restrict the use of the information to the health purposes indicated in the written statement of need;
1910.1020(f)(5)(ii)
May provide for appropriate legal remedies in the event of a breach of the agreement, including stipulation of a reasonable pre-estimate of likely damages; and,
1910.1020(f)(5)(iii)
1910.1020(f)(6)
Nothing in this section is meant to preclude the parties from pursuing non-contractual remedies to the extent permitted by law.
1910.1020(f)(7)
If the health professional, employee or designated representative receiving the trade secret information decides that there is a need to disclose it to OSHA, the employer who provided the information shall be informed by the health professional prior to, or at the same time as, such disclosure.
1910.1020(f)(8)
If the employer denies a written request for disclosure of a specific chemical identity, the denial must:
1910.1020(f)(8)(i)
1910.1020(f)(8)(ii)
1910.1020(f)(8)(iv)
1910.1020(f)(8)(v)
Explain in detail how alternative information may satisfy the specific medical or occupational health need without revealing the specific chemical identity.
1910.1020(f)(9)
The health professional, employee, or designated representative whose request for information is denied under paragraph (f)(4) of this section may refer the request and the written denial of the request to OSHA for consideration.
1910.1020(f)(10)
When a health professional, employee, or designated representative refers a denial to OSHA under paragraph (f)(9) of this section, OSHA shall consider the evidence to determine if:
1910.1020(f)(10)(i)
1910.1020(f)(10)(ii)
The health professional employee, or designated representative has supported the claim that there is a medical or occupational health need for the information; and
1910.1020(f)(10)(iii)
1910.1020(f)(11)
1910.1020(f)(11)(i)
If OSHA determines that the specific chemical identity requested under paragraph (f)(4) of this section is not a "bona fide" trade secret, or that it is a trade secret but the requesting health professional, employee or designated representatives has a legitimate medical or occupational health need for the information, has executed a written confidentiality agreement, and has shown adequate means for complying with the terms of such agreement, the employer will be subject to citation by OSHA.
1910.1020(f)(11)(ii)
If an employer demonstrates to OSHA that the execution of a confidentiality agreement would not provide sufficient protection against the potential harm from the unauthorized disclosure of a trade secret specific chemical identity, the Assistant Secretary may issue such orders or impose such additional limitations or conditions upon the disclosure of the requested chemical information as may be appropriate to assure that the occupational health needs are met without an undue risk of harm to the employer.
1910.1020(f)(12)
Notwithstanding the existence of a trade secret claim, an employer shall, upon request, disclose to the Assistant Secretary any information which this section requires the employer to make available. Where there is a trade secret claim, such claim shall be made no later than at the time the information is provided to the Assistant Secretary so that suitable determinations of trade secret status can be made and the necessary protections can be implemented.
1910.1020(f)(13)
Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as requiring the disclosure under any circumstances of process or percentage of mixture information which is a trade secret.
1910.1020(g)
1910.1020(g)(1)(i)
1910.1020(g)(1)(ii)
1910.1020(g)(1)(iii)
1910.1020(g)(2)
Each employer shall keep a copy of this section and its appendices, and make copies readily available, upon request, to employees. The employer shall also distribute to current employees any informational materials concerning this section which are made available to the employer by the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health.
1910.1020(h)(2)
Whenever an employer is ceasing to do business and there is no successor employer to receive and maintain the records subject to this standard, the employer shall notify affected current employees of their rights of access to records at least three (3) months prior to the cessation of the employer's business.
Whenever an employer either is ceasing to do business and there is no successor employer to receive and maintain the records, or intends to dispose of any records required to be preserved for at least thirty (30) years, the employer shall:
1910.1020(h)(3)(i)
Transfer the records to the Director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) if so required by a specific occupational safety and health standard; or
1910.1020(h)(3)(ii)
Notify the Director of NIOSH in writing of the impending disposal of records at least three (3) months prior to the disposal of the records.
1910.1020(h)(4)
Where an employer regularly disposes of records required to be preserved for at least thirty (30) years, the employer may, with at least (3) months notice, notify the Director of NIOSH on an annual basis of the records intended to be disposed of in the coming year.

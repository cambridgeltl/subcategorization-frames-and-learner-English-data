CONTEMPORARY ISSUES IN MANAGEMENT LABOUR RELATIONS
The socio-economic conditions in the Caribbean region are changing as the      island states grapple with the process of regional integration and entry      into the global economy. The economies of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)      member states are undergoing a process of transition from closed and      protected to open and market driven. This process is accelerated by numerous      separated but interrelated factors collectively fuelled by globalisation.
In response to globalising trends, new approaches and responses to labour      management relations are emerging as the social partners seek to find      appropriate responses to the effects of modernization and foreign      competition.
In a speech delivered on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the      Barbados Workers Union in Barbados, a senior member of the union stated       anyone who has taken time out to follow what we have been doing in the BWU      will note that, while we have remained true to the basic principles      governing the organization 60 years ago, we have at the same time, been      incrementally adjusting our policy and our action programmes to accommodate      the change we anticipate, not merely within our Barbados environment, but      within the wider Caribbean, as well as our position as a trade union within      these global affairs that impact on us.
Employers and employer associations have also expressed a desire to reduce      adversarialism as this restricts the implementation of change strategies to      increase international competitiveness. Increasing the level of trust and      cooperation between managers and workers is a preferred business strategy.      The following statement by the head of a major financial institution in      Trinidad underscores this view to achieve our objectives we have adopted a      collaborative approachthe key components of our collaborative environment      comprise: employee involvement and partnering with our unions.
Governments are also changing their labour management responses by seeking      to encourage more dialogue with the social partners as a means of improving      the labour relations climate. There is also an increased focus on labour      legislation reform, in recognition that much of the existing labour      legislation is outdated and ineffective. See: Strategy Paper on the      Modenisation of Ministries of Labour as Facilitators of Human  Resource      Oriented Strategies.
This module examines the new labour management paradigm emerging in post-      industrial Caribbean enterprises and the forces driving this change.
CHANGES IN POST-INDUSTRIAL CARIBBEAN ECONOMIES
Two distinct characteristics of globalisation are its scope and intensity.
The scope of globalisation is demonstrated by the increasing        integration of the world economy through cross-country transactions.
The intensity dimension is measured by the increasing interdependence        and interconnectedness between
Economies experiencing globalisation experience the following changes:
National economies and economic trading blocs become less        self-contained, and more economically interdependent and integrated due        to:
increased direct foreign investment
Caribbean Evidence:
The movement towards regional integration and the creation of a          Caribbean Single Market Economy (CSME) by members of CARICOM.
The regionalizing of the financial sector by the expansion of          financial institutions from their home base to other territories.
The removal of tariffs and non-tariff barriers from commodity export          products, for example bananas.
The establishment of Free Trade Association of the Americas (FTAA),          The US Caribbean Basin Initiative and the North American Free Trade          Association (NAFTA).
Governments are increasingly less able to control the flow of capital,        information, technology, intellectual capital, people, products and        services across borders. David Korten in Globalising civil Society says        the power to govern has passed from the people to distant institutions        driven primarily by the imperatives of the business world
Caribbean Evidence:
The region has used Export Processing Zones to attract investment in          low skill manufacturing, garment production and electronic components          assembly. As other regions have developed EPZs, with much more          competitive investment factors, Caribbean countries are finding it          increasingly difficult to attract low skill type investments.
Industrial development in the region is underdeveloped and fragile.          Many of the countries have based their industrial development on          commodity products (oil, gas, bauxite, bananas, sugar) and services. -          tourism is the principal service industry. With globalisation these          sectors are under threat of marginalisation due to low economic growth          and loss of competitiveness. Economists estimate that the region needs          to sustain economic growth rates in excess of 7% per annum if it is to          successfully compete with other developing regions  China, Latin          America, South East Asia for development and growth opportunities.
Outward migration of skilled labour and knowledge workers to North          America, and the United Kingdom.
The removal of tariffs and non-tariff trade barriers, bringing an end        to protected markets and restrictions on the flow of capital, goods,        services and labour. Trade liberalization has brought domestic and        international markets closer. This has made it made it easier to access        and move production resources across the globe.
Trade liberalization has forced:
Deregulation of protected and controlled services and utilities by          national governments
The de-regulation of financial and commodity markets, alongside the          integration of goods, services and capital markets to create regional          markets such as the European Union and the Free Trade Area of the          Americas
Increased privatisation of state owned enterprises and the creation of        a modern public sector investment climate.
Caribbean Evidence:
of public enterprises,        especially those in the utility sector and transportation sectors        (telecommunications, water, electricity, public transportation, airline        industry).
Public service initiatives to reform and modernise the public service        The private sector considers that the most serious impediment to the        establishment of an environment best suited to the fostering of a healthy        business climate is the bureaucratic culture of the public sector and the        relationship between the two sectors. The relationship is at present        characterised by guarded mistrust on the part of the public sector and a        view on the part of certain elements in the private sector that the civil        service is a costly and unnecessary waste of manpower .
The State has acquired a new role as a provider of the political,        macro-economic, regulatory, infrastructural, institutional and social        framework to stimulate investment in
partnership with the private sector.
Production of goods and services acceptable to needs of a global        market. Customer tastes and preferences across borders are determined by        common attributes such as quality, speed, technical superiority, short        product life, customer service and product differentiation. Enterprises        now require production and managerial flexibility to respond quickly to        changes in market demand
The emergence of new production structures. One such example is the        global enterprise, in which a product or service is produced and        distributed by a network of enterprises across the world, each enterprise        contributing to the global manufacturing and distribution process based on        its core competencies.
At enterprise level new production techniques have allowed enterprises to        produce products and services with lower cost, improved quality, shorter        production cycles and faster delivery to customers.
Enterprises are experiencing higher levels of output with fewer workers.        Increases in productivity require workers who are better trained and        educated with the ability to perform a wider range of jobs. Much low-        value, low skill jobs are disappearing from the workplace
Caribbean Evidence:
Caribbean enterprises are entering into smart partnerships or        strategic alliance with international enterprises. Throughout the region        efforts are being made to attract foreign investors, as are the tourism,        energy, telecommunication and small manufacturing sectors in many        Caribbean countries. Additionally, there have been examples of        international companies forming joint venture and other strategic        alliances. Strategic alliances and company mergers have made job security        for workers much more unpredictable.
Greater labour mobility and the need to acquire and retain skilled human        resources, has increased the diversity of the work force. This in turn has        generated new concerns for equity, equality of treatment and opportunity.        The increasing influx of women into workforces has raised at the        enterprise level issues relating to gender discrimination, better        opportunities for the promotion and advancement of women, and welfare        facilities
Advances in new scientific fields such as biotechnology, electronics,        genetics and material science, are producing new products and services.        This has accelerated the rate of product obsolescence and increased the        level of substitution. Communication and telecommunication technologies        are resolving information/coordination difficulties in enterprises.        E-commerce, and internet technologies have facilitated the rapid        integration of markets.
The term
Caribbean Evidence:
The growth in the Caribbean e-commerce is a good example of the rapid        spread of information technology into Caribbean commerce.
The commercial ISPs serving the Net access needs of Caribbean economies        have allowed commercial banks and other financial institutions to        introduce on line banking services, ATM and electronic point of sale        service. The emergence of company websites, intranet communications, cyber        cafes and wireless access is evidence of the entry of Caribbean        enterprises into the dot com economy.
To survive in the global market, countries have to redefine their        competitiveness. Enterprises in developing and developed economies are        developing international competitiveness based on factors such as
Caribbean Evidence:
Caribbean enterprises, which have traditionally based competitiveness of        natural resource endowments oil, bauxite, agricultural products. This        approach has been termed low road strategies. The new model for        international competitiveness is based on the adoption of high road        strategies. Caribbean enterprises have responded to rationalisation by        engaging in:
. To achieve the flexibility and productive efficiency          required to respond quickly and effectively to market changes, broader          job descriptions are now being used. This is resulting in work tasks          based on broader groupings of activities, emphasising the undertaking of          "whole" tasks. In some instances improved technology has been          substituted for labour.
reengineering. In the interests of greater          efficiency, work is also being re-organized, giving greater emphasis to          team based activities with a view to improving linkages across units and          departments within an enterprise. The identification of core functions          and peripheral functions, has led to the outsourcing of non-core          activities and workers.
. There is a "flattening" of management          hierarchies and devolution of greater operational responsibility and          authority to lower level managers, supervisors and work teams.          Enterprises have used downsizing and delayering to achieve numerical          flexibility and improved linkages across units and departments.
The use of internal and external benchmarking to establish and          maintain "best practice", and to leverage organisational learning.
KEY IDEA
The trends pushing globalisation has forced enterprises in developed      countries to adopt new competitive requirements and forge new labour      management relationships. Enterprises in developing economies must develop      new approaches to competitiveness and labour management relations in order      to adequately respond to the forces driving the 21st century world economy.      Failure to do so increases the risk of marginalisation, as globalisation      tends to accentuate the worlds inequalities.
CHANGES IN INDUSTRIAL AND LABOUR RELATIONS
Just as the economic environment is changing, the political and industrial      relations environment in Caribbean states is also changing.
Evidence of the change
The strong alliance between the labour movement and government regimes        has weakened over time, as a new cadre of political leaders from the        professional class have emerged. The generation of political leaders born        of the trade union movement is dawning to a close.
The State in many countries has adopted a new stance as a facilitator        of economic development by focusing on institutional strengthening and        effective governance of the public sector. In many countries, the State        has been reducing its workforce. This affects the labour movement as        Government service tends to be amongst the largest unionised sector in        Caribbean economies.
As governments have pursued open market strategies new labour        practices have emerged. Outsourcing, subcontracting, the increase use of        part-time and temporary labour and flexitime have become practices.
Worker commitment to unions appears to be on the wane, especially for        well educated generation Xers . Educated knowledge workers are less        likely to be attracted to or dependent on trade unions. This trend is        affecting the movements ability to attract young recruits from the        professional and managerial class.
Increased diversity in the workplace has brought more segmentation in        the work force and new worker needs. Trade unions have to address workers        concerns relating to HIV/ AIDS, gender equity, sexual harassment, equality        of treatment for physically challenged workers, workplace violence, crime,        the expansion of the informal sector and environmental protection.
In response to these changes in the labour market, trade unions have to      shift from an adversarial system of industrial relations to one based on      partnership building.
New Approaches to Industrial Relations and Labour Relations Management
In response to the new competitive pressures, and changing labour markets,      the social sector partners have recognised the need to develop a new      response to labour management relations. The new response embraces the      building of partnerships, the deepening of tripartite consultation and the      adoption of new approaches to collective bargaining.
The social partnership model is based on the coming together of the social        partners to address critical industrial relations issues. The        collaboration of the social partners results in the drawing up of an        agreement document or protocol. The protocol defines expected levels of        conduct during the life of the agreement, and defines the various ways by        which conflict can be resolved. An important element of conflict handling        is the strengthening of the relationship between the partners.
The following quotations from the General Secretary of the BWU on the        occasion of its 60th anniversary points to the new thinking emerging in        the labour sector in the region:
Another preferred approach for us is the tripartite discussions of social        partners who recognise their shared responsibility for the labour market,        each one understanding that it has as much a responsibility as the other        for what happens in the labour market, and what happens to people who are        excluded
The BWU prefers the labour management approach which is based on        voluntarism. This is a system where the Government permits the employers        and the trade unions, with minimum government interference, to conduct        labour management affairs and to reach levels of satisfactory        relationships which the parties feel they can properly live with . the        Government still has to set down certain minimum standards below which the        players will not go.
This method of voluntarism permits integrity and honour to govern        bargaining in the market place.
We believes that
and understanding must be the underpinning of any        relationship for it is only when parties trust and understand each other        or, in the tripartite mode, trust and respect one another that we will be        able to tackle problems together rather than to attack each other.
there must be an arrangement for shared responsibility with employers to        channel the resources of workers in the national response to globalisation        and trade liberalisation ...
Caribbean Examples
in        1995 to the Social Partners.
This document sets out the general Labour Policy to which the Region        aspires, consistent with international standards and other international        instruments. It is an important policy guide on labour matters for the        Social Partners and will contribute to the development of a healthy        industrial relations climate, and enhanced social partnership. It        underscores the rights and responsibilities of the Social Partners, and        provides the bases for the development of national labour policies, and        inform the enactment of labour legislation.
In the
Three for the Implementation of Social        Partnership 1998-2000, entered into by the government, the private sector        and workers organisations states in its Statement of Intent:
1.1The Social Partners desire through association in a Social Compact to        create a modern, efficient economy which is able to produce high and        sustainable economic growth accompanied by increased employment, to        establish through low inflation an equilibrium between prices and incomes,        and to achieve a society which enjoys a greater degree of inclusiveness in        all its facets .
1.2 The Social Partners regard this Protocol as an instrument of policy to        achieve industrial harmony and as a means to confront the challenges of        globalization and the demands of the information age with a view to        improving the competitiveness of the economy as part of the future social        development of Barbados.
Collective bargaining between management and labour have often focused        on distributive approaches in which both parties reach agreement over the        allocation of wages, benefits and other conditions of work. The goal in        distributive bargaining is not to assure that both sides win, but rather        that one side (your side) wins as much as it can, which generally means        that the other side will lose, or at least get less than it had wanted.        Distributive bargaining tactics rarely assume the economic pie will be        divided in half.
Common tactics include:
Having more negotiators than the other side.
Using tricks and deception to try to get the other side to concede          more than you concede.
Making threats or issuing ultimatums.
Trying to force the other side to give in by overpowering them or          outsmarting them.
A new approach to collective bargaining is integrative bargaining.        Integrative bargaining, which is less antagonistic than distributive        bargaining, places more emphasis on the adoption of collaborative        approaches that will enhance enterprise productivity and create value for        all parties - make the economic pie bigger. Integrative bargaining        approaches are employed when two sides facing a common problem, seek        solutions as equals. By cooperating and focusing on interests rather than        positions, the pie can almost always be enlarged or some other way can be        found to provide gains for all sides. ." .
Integrative bargaining approached have been successfully used in the        automobile and steel industries in the USA  see articles

and Unions: Alternative Strategies.
In Caribbean enterprises integrative bargaining is in its infancy.        Years of mistrust, class separation, perceptions of worker manager        inequality, role stereotypes and lack of trust are standing in the way.
Labour Legislation Revision  Governments response
Labour and employment legislation in Caribbean state have tended to be        aligned to the furtherance of government economic polices. Generally the        labour legislation has been geared to foster an industrial relations        climate that encourages investment. This goal may not always be consistent        with good labour standards.
Labour legislation in Caribbean states have the following common features:
Decision making based on the ILO standards of tripartism.
Equal pay for equal value of work.
Systems and processes for the administration of labour and the          settlements of disputes.
The enactment of ILO labour standards pertaining to hours of work,          wages, severance pay, discipline and termination of workers,          retrenchment, maternity leave, health and safety the registration of trade unions.
The rights of trade unions to be recognised as the bargaining agents          for workers in bargaining units.
The prohibition of discrimination against workers on the grounds of          race , sex, disability, religion, marital status.
The rights of workers to form and be members of a trade union.
In response to the changing economic and labour market conditions, many        States are in the process of revising their labour laws. CARICOM had        prepared a Declaration of Labour Relations Principles as a guide for        labour ministries.
Grenada has one of the most modern labour laws in the Caribbean. The        Grenada Labour Code is based on ILO Standards and was developed through a        process of social partner consultation, and consensus. The process took        twelve years.
KEY IDEA
The social partners have recognised that traditional labour management      approaches are not effective. Private sector organisations have realised      that adversarial labour relations and distributive collective bargaining      limits the implementation of high road strategies and this affects the      viability and competitiveness of enterprises. Labour leaders are also aware      that embracing the social partnership model is the way forward.
The Governments in the region are also supporting high road development      approaches creating the climate for improved industrial relations through      the introduction of new labour law initiatives. Together the social partners      are positively influencing labour market relations.

Organisational boundarylessness can be imagined as a house that has three      barriers:
Horizontal Barriers - walls that divide the house horizontally.        In a corporation they are the barriers between separate geographic        locations, departments and product lines.
Vertical Barriers-  ceilings and floors. In a company        differences in rank and hierarchy obstruct open communication .        Information sharing should pass freely from top to bottom and across        layers.
External Barriers - external walls and the spaces that separate        the house from neighbours. In a corporation there must be close        communication all stakeholder.
Boundarylessness thrives in a culture of openness and cooperation.
READINGS
Excerpts from an article by Robert W. Ahern, Partner, Competitive Human      Resource Strategies, Inc
When viewed from the perspective of the application of power, an      organization is structured to institutionalize systems for carrying out the      intentions of the group(s) of people who "run" the organization. These      structures and systems are designed to condition the behavior (actions) of      the people that "work for" the organization.
Power over money, power over physical assets, power over knowledge, and      power over communications form a matrix which conditions and controls the      behavior of organization members. But power in organizations flows in all      directions, including from the bottom up. Therefore, those people who wish      to run the organization must somehow legitimize their use of power over      others.
The legitimization process requires that the powerful undertake certain      obligations, duties and responsibilities towards those subject to their      power. Legitimization also requires that the leadership use its power to set      and to achieve goals acceptable to the members of the organization.      Historically, these requirements can and have been met in strongly      authoritarian organizations which workers join by reason of economic      necessity and in which the major element in the power mix is the use of the      sanctions available to forcibly condition the required behavior.
Today, however, the continuing emergence of the democratic value set of our      society and the heightened competitive standards of international markets      are forcing the leadership of American organizations to seek new and higher      levels of legitimization. They are now being required to create and      implement organizations that:
Go beyond the basic motivation of economic necessity to reach the        higher order needs of workers for involvement, achievement, and enhanced        sense of personal worth.
Provide all members of the organization with a strong sense of        "ownership" and commitment to the organization and its goals.
Expose their stewardship of the organization to open critique and        adjustment through consensus processes.
Increasingly, it has become obvious that this task is no longer        optional. The use of power in American firms must be legitimated to the        point that it permits the deep involvement and value commitment of all its        members in the success of the enterprise.
ALTERATIONS IN MANAGEMENT POWER
Given this new configuration for industrial governance, how do the power      dynamics between the parties change? Let us examine the power gains and      losses. First, consider management: the essential economic and      organizational power of management remains undisturbed. The ownership of the      business and its attendant rights and powers still reside in management.      Management sets direction and strategy. It makes the essential business      decisions and retains the right to allocate its resources as it sees fit. It      can still close operations subject only to current NLRB and court decisions      and guidelines. It can still adjust the work force subject only to whatever      employment security agreement it negotiates with the union. It retains all      its prior powers over the management work force. It retains and even      enhances the power of its functional expertise.
With regard to plant operations and the hourly work force the following      changes in power dynamics are apparent:
REDUCTIONS IN POWER
Loss of unilateral power to make those operational decisions which are        within the scope of the involvement structure.
Some reductions in the ascribed status and power of plant management        positions.
Loss of immediate reaction capability in some cases.
Reduction in power flowing from monopoly control of knowledge,        information, and communication.
Reduction in ability to dominate in negotiations solely through        exercise of economic power.
Reduction in ability to dominate and control through taking arbitrary        positions in grievance and discipline procedures.
INCREASES IN POWER
Increased power through enhanced use of the knowledge, application and        motivation of the work force.
Increased commitment of work force.
Increased credibility, legitimacy and effectiveness of communication.
Vast improvement in intelligence on plant processes, problems,        effectiveness of management personnel, usefulness of management systems,        and the realities of the work culture.
More professional and objective negotiations, labour relations        stability, more flexible collective bargaining agreements, and significant        reduction in probabilities of strike or job action.
It appears that those managements who have decided to enter worker      involvement structures of this type have concluded that there is a net gain      in power flowing from these adjustments in power dynamics. There is an old      bromide in leadership training which sounds paradoxical: leaders gain power      by sharing power. Power, because it is relational and comes from many      sources in an organization, is never a "zero-sum" game. A more analytical      look at the above dynamics will show that the organization's power over      people shifts from the coercive power of economic and organizational      sanctions towards power earned through acquired influence and value      commitment.
To confront today's realities, many American managements have the courage to      leave outworn ideologies behind and to grant unions and union workers power      in operational decision making that only a few years ago even the most      audacious union would not have requested and even the weakest management      would have rejected out of hand.
ALTERATIONS IN UNION POWER
American unions also now appear to be ready to step forward to play a      proactive role in and accept responsibility for making our industrial      organizations competitive. They are concluding that the effective management      of American industry is too critical to our society to be left to management      alone....
It is clear that American unions are beginning to perceive joint power      sharing as both a logical and a necessary step in the evolution of our      collective bargaining system. A look at the changes in union power will      provide some of the rationale for the union's change of position.
REDUCTIONS IN POWER
The ability of the union to react negatively to positive management      initiatives is reduced.
The ability to use economic power to dominate negotiations is reduced as is      the ability to use guerrilla warfare tactics in the grievance and discipline      procedures.
The union's historical stance as a countervailing force ideologically in      opposition to management is compromised. The union now accepts joint      responsibility for the success of the enterprise.
Acceptance of the partnership role and the responsibility for its decisions      reduces the union power to harness the frustration of hourly workers to      react against management initiatives.
Acceptance of joint responsibility means a potential loss of political power      since the union may not now exploit management errors or rely on deep-seated      distrust of management to develop political support. Union leaders must      develop new political styles and strategies to build political support.
INCREASES IN POWER
Increase in the scope of bargaining to cover consensus decision making        on operational matters.
Access to top management, to information (including financial        information), and to the details of strategic plans and initiatives.
Increased bargaining power to negotiate employment security        arrangements.
Increased bargaining power through the utilization and development of        higher skill levels in the work force.
Increased ability to affect the performance of the organization and        thereby increase the economic and security rewards available to union        members.
More professional and objective negotiations and an attendant ability        to negotiate increased employment security and human resource systems        designed to meet the higher order needs of the work force for involvement,        recognition, achievement, and a feeling of self worth.
Increase in union members' identification with and participation in        the union.
Increased power to enhance the quality of work life through work, job,        and organization design.
On balance, the union, under this new approach to collective bargaining,      has a net power gain during the term of the agreement. It gains considerable      power to positively influence the daily work lives of its members. By      exercising the proactive leadership role in this new configuration it can      provide its members with involvement and joint control in the work place,      and establish a foundation for employment security. It also will have      increased documentation of the contribution made by the union and its      members when it comes to the negotiating table. In working jointly with      management to design the new organization, it can champion and effectuate      more humanistic values in the work place and make sure its members have the      necessary training, systems, and tools to become a world class work force.
At this point, most unions know that change processes of this kind cannot be      used to undermine the union provided such processes are under joint control      and the union is at the center of the necessary changes. However, any local      union undertaking such a difficult change process is well advised to look to      developing and institutionalizing a new philosophy, an extended set of      values, and new roles for its leadership because, as the change process      moves forward, the old philosophy, the narrow set of values, and the      reactive leadership roles will become more and more obsolete and      counter-productive....
WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?
The potential for joint power enhancement has made worker involvement      attractive for the parties. And, in their innocent enthusiasm they have      decreed "let there be empowerment" as if a fiat from the top can lead to      cultural change. At present the landscape is strewn with the wreckage of      such efforts. Fortunately we are learning from such disasters and the      literature is beginning to reflect the learning of post mortem studies.
We are also learning from the successes and are now ready to reflexively      feed back these findings to the change process and the "social actors" who      can make it happen. Specifically, with regard to organization change in      unionized firms, the agenda for immediate attention is becoming clear. We      must first of all recognize worker involvement as an evolutionary step in      our collective bargaining system. In addition we must:
Develop a coherent and comprehensive philosophical foundation for the        new organization which includes a well articulated value set. Such value        set must be consistent with the economic realties we face and the basic        humanistic and democratic values of our society.
Encourage both parties to revisit their historical and ideological        roots and evolve philosophies and operating principles which are        consistent with those roots but which reflect the economic realities of        the early 21st century.
Redesign negotiating mechanisms, grievance and arbitration procedures,        and collective bargaining agreements to harmonize with the new        organizational principles.
Develop principles and mechanisms for the joint management of        operations, worker involvement and organizational change processes.
Develop and effectuate roles for management and union leaders which        take into account necessary change in status, function, power and        responsibilities.
Create systems with job structures to motivate and reinforce behavior        consistent with the new value sets and organizational principles.
Develop learning processes and structure to orchestrate and expedite        evolutionary change.
Develop a much improved understanding of human communication and        design new systems to assure communication flow adequate to the need of        the new organization.
By the mid-seventies it had become clear to many practitioners that the      American collective bargaining system was badly in need of an overhaul. In      the eighties, important experimental work was done throughout the country      which provided insights and opened the door for substantial modifications.      The business of these years at the turn of the century is to undertake a      major reconstruction of the system. The agenda above is formidable, but at      least and, at last, we have begun.
and Unions: Alternative Strategies
In the 1970s and 1980s corporations in an increasingly competitive world      marketplace became aware that profitability and sometimes survival requires      a long-term focus on continuous improvement in processes and systems to      improve customer satisfaction and decrease costs. It has been widely      accepted that continuous improvement requires getting those who do the work      and know the systems engaged in the process of improvement. This can be done      effectively only when there is delineated purpose, vision, and direction      that are shared by all of the stakeholders (people who have an interest) in      the system. This requires a process through which these stakeholders      actively participate in creating that purpose, vision, and direction. In a      unionised company, the union must be treated as a key stakeholder and the      legitimate representative of employees. There are a wide range of approaches      that an organization may take when dealing with a unionised organization.      The organization must seek the strategy that can best result in continuous      improvement within the unionised corporation. The following are strategic      options available to an organization:
Strategy 1 -
Management can take the posture of doing everything possible to encourage      their union employees to begin de certification proceedings. These      proceedings are extremely difficult and legally risky to accomplish with      only one out of four efforts likely to succeed. The de certification process      itself causes employees to divide into competing factions and usually takes      years to accomplish. All of this diverts energy which should be focused on      customers needs.
Strategy 2 - Hardball
For organizations choosing a "hardball" strategy, management takes a      position in which they view the union representatives as always wrong and      feel that the union must consistently be contested. Arbitration and      mediation become a way of life. Management assesses a situation, figures out      a solution, and then, somehow, jams the solution down the throat of the      union. Management views the union as a major roadblock which must be      bulldozed. It doesn't matter what the issue is, Sunday overtime premium or      seniority provisions; if management is to make progress, they must remove      the roadblock at any cost. From a management perspective playing hardball      may be an effective strategy in dealing with unions. But, it is costly and      is divisive within the plants or offices. In addition, people lose focus of      their primary goal of serving the customer's needs. The focus moves from      what is right to who is right. Each side presumes that their position is      always right, and that is simply not true. Finally, taking a hardball      approach often places the decision making authority into the hands of an      arbitrator, a person who has no interest in serving the needs of the      customers.
Management must believe that the union serves a legitimate and valued        purpose. Management can no longer go to the union with only management        issues; it must also work with the union on its interests and problems as        an institution.
Management must stop going to the union with a solution. They must go        to the union with the problem and assume that together they can find a        solution.
Management must communicate much more often and with considerably more        depth with its union officials than most organizations do now. A true        partnership requires routine communication about all business issues.        Union leaders need to understand the economic and other business realities        that management leaders are facing.
Management must earn a positive reaction from the union institution;        it takes time and positive experiences before management can realistically        expect union officials to venture forward and assert their influence upon        their members to achieve continuous improvement. After all, every company        has the kind of union-management relationship that management created. It        may well not have been the current management that created that        relationship, however, it was management that created the ideas in the        minds of its employees that they needed a union. Management must take the        lead in creating the environment in which a true partnership can emerge.
Management must pay attention and be willing to address subjects of        interest to unions. These interests include continuous training and        development, safety and health, sharing the economic gain, and employment        security and union viability.
Finally, in essence, a true partnership with unions requires that        management view the institution of organized labour as a stakeholder in        the enterprise. When we think of stakeholders, we quickly think of        customers, shareholders, suppliers, employees, and community interest        groups. The achievement of continuous improvement requires that management        view the union as a stakeholder as well.
Forging New Ways to Work - Steel Plant Management and Union Work      Collectively, Not Separately
Article provided by Fontaine Associates - "Partnering For The High      Performance Work Place" Taken from the April 1998 issue of News For A Change      published by the Association for Quality and Participation.
Along the banks of the Chesapeake Bay, not far from the Atlantic ports of      nearby Baltimore, Maryland, lay the blast furnaces, slab casters and strip      mills that comprise the Sparrows Point division of Bethlehem Steel      Corporation. An operation deeply rooted in history of the steel industry,      Sparrows Point has come to signify not only the past, but also the future.      In the 1950s a workforce of more than 30,000 unionised employees worked      within the confines of Sparrows Point. Today a mere 5,000 remain after years      of automation and threats from foreign competition. So to say that union      negotiating can be a tenuous process in these parts is an understatement.      But in 1993 a long-term no-strike/no-layoff agreement (recently extended      until August 1999) paved the way for a period of stability for all.
But just when things looked peaceful, Bethlehem Steel reported a net loss of      $309 million in 1996, and talks of mill closings and relocations began to      surface. In December 1997 Bethlehem Steel announced plans to merge with      Lukens, Inc., a Coatesville, Pennsylvania producer of steel plate, further      increasing fears that pieces of Sparrows Point would have to be closed. That      brought everybody back to the bargaining table. The most recent agreement      created a partnership that provides a $300 million investment in renovating      Sparrows Point's current cold rolling mill (instead of moving it out of      state), in exchange for the union's help in cutting costs.
Joe Rosel is the union coordinator of the partnership program, Sparrows      Point Division, Sparrows Point, Maryland Rosel has recently returned from      participating in a international panel of experts at the European Institute      of Business Administration (INSEAD) in France, during which people from      around the world came to hear unique and innovative practices for
. In the following interview, News for a Change Editor Bill      Brewer spoke with Rosel about the current state of Sparrows Point and the      unique partnership that brought them there.
NFC: What have been the challenges for you as you've moved from a      confrontational mode of labour and management negotiation?
Rosel: Well, we don't usually say collaboration. That word has some      connotation in the union that we don't like. We like the word participation.      We actively participate with the managers to make sure that the division is      going to be successful. Part of that is really trying to overthrow      scientific management and Taylorism. Taylor started his studies at Bethlehem      Steel in 1906. So we are more deeply entrenched in scientific management      than almost any other company.
NFC: Some of the ramifications of that being...?
Rosel: That the workers would check their brains in at the time clock. We      didn't have to think. Management was going to think for us. That's not a      really good way to work. You have to have all kinds of people looking over      your shoulder to see if you're doing what they want you to do rather than      have people be self-directed. Which is what the partnership agreement was      saying. We should do workplace redesigns that would allow the workplace to      be safer, fairer, less authoritarian with more control and influence from      the workers, substantially reducing the levels of management. It was trying      to get away from an authoritarian, scientific management style of managing,      to one where the workers have to take on more accountability and      responsibility.
NFC: The plate mill was shut down two months ago?
Rosel: Well the plate mill hasn't been shut down. It's still running, but      the company's announced that the plate mill is going to be shut down by the      end of the year. In this partnership agreement we have an employment      security agreement. We can put people from the plate mill into the      employment security pool.
NFC: And what's the employee security pool?
Rosel: If people are displaced by technology or by shutdowns like the one in      the plate mill, then we can have them do other work in other parts of the      plant, rather than have them laid off.
NFC: What have been some of the challenges for you over the past few      years with this partnership?
Rosel: There's been the challenge of trying to communicate to people exactly      what this partnership agreement is and why it's in their best interest. And      also educating them about the business, about the union and about new roles      and ways of working that would help us be successful in the future. Being an      agent of change is not that easy. You have let people come to conclusions      themselves in some cases. Give them the information, try to be factual and      truthful, and have them come to the same conclusion that you're coming to.
NFC: How difficult is change from labour's perspective?
Rosel: The biggest change that's happened here in the last 12 months is the      union negotiated an agreement to get a new cold mill in this plant that's      worth $300 million by agreeing to $30 million in cost savings around      changing work practices in the plant.
NFC: What are some of those work practices that have changed to create      those savings?
Rosel: Operator assists maintenance, craft-to-craft lead-follow maintenance,      combination overlaps of control tech, instrument tech and electronics, and a      new position in the plant that's a union position called working coordinator      that takes the place of first-line supervisors--where the union supervises      itself.
NFC: And that person's job would be...
Rosel: Basically they are allowed to work with their tools and work with the      crew, but they are the first-line supervisor. They take the place of the      foreman. This is the union taking over the first-line supervisory function      in the plant and making that a union position instead of a management      position.
NFC: How did management react to that?
Rosel: At first they didn't react too favourably. We had NCBA (not covered      by the bargaining agreement) positions that were hourly people the company      would pull out of the hourly ranks. The company selected them without any      input from the union and they became the first-line foremen. They paid union      dues, but couldn't do any work with their tools even though they knew how to      do the work. If you have a management foreman, they're not allowed to work.      If they get caught working with their tools, the union files a grievance for      four hours pay. This way (the new agreement) you have a foreman who directs      the crew, but if the crew needs help, they can be utilized as part of the      crew.
NFC: How do you respond to those critics that feel these kinds of      partnerships have basically co-opted the union's authority?
Rosel: This program is put forth by the union, not by the company. We      developed the training. We developed the education. We have driven this      process. We caucus as a union, so that we don't lose our identity as a      union. To understand, if this isn't in our self-interest, then we're not      going to do it.
NFC: What has been the biggest change in your way of thinking over the      past 10 years in terms of how you approach your work?
Rosel: The biggest change is that the union has to be part of figuring out      how to best manage the plant. In other words, the management of the plant is      too important to leave to the management. The union has to actually get      involved in trying to manage these divisions for success. And try to do that      in a win-win situation where the workers get paid more money and have a      better future, but the performance of the company is also enhanced.
NFC: What do you see as the challenges ahead for you?
Rosel: I think that the work that we did already is going to make our      negotiation in '99 a lot easier. We've enhanced performance and sustained      profitability for all the years under the partnership. And it wasn't because      the price of steel went up. It wasn't because the company put new equipment      in the plant. It's because the people in the plant are working better and      smarter than ever before. So, the main thing for us is to make sure we get      our fair share of this new wealth we've created and that we continue the      partnership agreement, hopefully with the no-layoff clause which has been      very successful and was a big change.
NFC: Have you seen management's perspective of these negotiations      changing as you have brought something different to the table?
Rosel: I think before the partnership, management probably thought the union      really didn't care whether the company was profitable or not. Now they see      that there are many people in union leadership positions who have done      things to try to enhance the profitability of the division, while not really      undermining the workforce.
NFC: One of those recent examples is with the plate mill and the      anticipated closing. Some workers had participated in a plant wide agreement      to produce $130 million in savings in, exchange for the $300 million      investment in the steel rolling mill, which was going to cost about 900      jobs.
Rosel: I think of the partnership process when we're negotiating around the      cold mill agreement. The company says to the union that we don't have any      money. We have to go borrow the money from the bank and the bankers want us      to insure that we make this agreement in a way that we can get an acceptable      return.
Through the partnership process and being able to have access to information      and consultants, we can investigate these things. The union never made the      cold mill agreement believing the company didn't have any money. We knew      they had money. That's not why we made the agreement. We made the agreement      because it was in our interest to make the agreement. Because the company      had the option of moving this cold mill to Virginia or some other state and      if they did that, it was going to be the end of Sparrows Point. So we made      the agreement because it was in our self-interest to do it.
The partnership is not necessarily about
. It's like what Deming said      about quality, "In God we trust, all others must bring data." Hopefully the      company tells us the truth most of the time, but even when they don't, we're      able to discern for ourselves whether that's factual or not.
And yes, there are problems in the sense that the Lukens Steel decision      wasn't made by the management at the division level, it was made by the      corporate management. And because that deal involved the purchase of stock      in Lukens, there are confidentiality questions. Having said that, there's      still information that we need. What is the business case behind the company      buying Lukens and how does that affect the long-term profitability and      ability of Sparrows Point to be successful? If our plate mill gets shut      down, and it looks like it will be, there's the possibility of layoffs, but      there's also the possibility that we may not have to lay anybody off. The      agreement represented 900 jobs. One hundred of those jobs are management      jobs. 400 of those jobs are ones that are displaced by the technology of the      new cold mill. So, that reduction of 400 was predicated by the equipment.      The other 400 jobs were work practice changes that the union agreed to in      order to save $30 million that was part of a whole program to save $130      million.
What happened under the partnership is that we know the nature of the steel      business now. We know that the mini-plants are out there running under a      different paradigm than the integrated steel companies and that we have to      compete with them. The union is still making proposals to create new union      jobs by profitable growth of downstream operations. So all those things are      going on in partnership that never would have happened before because we      would have never had enough information to try to make these proposals to      correct these decisions
NFC: You pointed out that the partnership is not about trust. I'd like      you to envision a world where it was about trust. How would things be      different or what would have to change?
Rosel: It would be better if it was about trust. Maybe over time we will get      more trust because trust has to be earned through experience. When people      tell you truth and when people do what they say they're going to do, you      start to develop trust.
NFC: But why would management not have trust in you if you're coming up      with ideas to help them be more successful? $130 million in savings is      rather significant.
Rosel: Organizations are too big and there are too many people. Even if I      trust the division president, who's to say that the corporate officers      aren't going to decide that the company must move in another direction. So      how do I trust hundreds of people, many of whom I don't even know? The thing      is that people really need to operate in their own self-interest. You can      look for win-win situations, but you shouldn't do things that are against      your interest, hoping down the road, somebody's going to do something for      you. You have to make the company successful and do it in the interest of      the company, but you have to do things that are in the interest of the union      at the same time. It's like a marriage, both people have to get something      out of it.
NFC: How are those two in conflict? What's in the best interest of the      union and what's in the best interest of the company?
Rosel: If you give the union and the management the same information, we're      probably, in most cases, going to make the same decision. But if we don't      have that information then we're liable to make an uniformed decision that      may be wrong. So the partnership process gives us this information and we      are able to evaluate this information and try to make the best decision      possible. And sometimes, like the disagreement around the cold mill, it's      not good for the union that we have to reduce 400 jobs by work practice      changes in order to get this mill. But if we didn't, we would've lost all      4,300 jobs in the long run.
We had to face reality. The business is about making money and getting      acceptable returns. We're hoping that through this agreement we can actually      grow the business and get some of those jobs back through profitable growth      and downstream operations. But obviously, if the plant wasn't here, we'd      have no chance.
NFC: If you were on the other side of the table, what kinds of changes      would you make?
Rosel: Well, one of the goals would be... in order to become a first class      company you have to treat all employees first class. But too many times in      corporations, especially old-line corporations, there's a cultural division      between people based upon their position in the company. I'd like to break      it down so every person is as valuable as the next person and everybody's      input is valued and every person is treated as first class, not as corporate      people being first class, the people in the division second class, and the      union another class. Everybody's in it together.
NFC: Creating a larger sense of community in other words. How would you      do that? What would be a first step?
Rosel: One of the first steps is for people to sit down and talk. For the      highest ranking people in the company to be willing to come down and have      frank discussions with rank and file workers. Let them know that they      actually care about what they're doing. At the same time making sure that      people are engaged in the processes of making the union successful, making      the company successful and also giving them a clear set of expectations of      how these things are going to be accomplished. I mean, that's simple.
NFC: Why do you think that it is so hard?
Rosel: I think that a culture developed over a long period of time through      Taylorism and other kinds of management styles that separated people more      than brought people together. Instead of engaging people, it was a command      and control situation where the general doesn't have to take the time and      talk to the troops because he could delegate it down to somebody else.
NFC: What's one of the key things you learned at the European Institute      of Business Administration conference last month?
Rosel: That people are the answer, not the problem. It has to come from the      heart. You work to have people giving their hearts and minds to doing things      as well as they can because they realize it's in their interest to do that.      That people are the answer to businesses doing better. And the way you do      that is to treat people very well

Mandatory Overtime
Mandatory Overtime Definition
Mandatory overtime  is when employers require employees to work                     in excess of 40 hours per workweek, even if employees don't want to. Subsequently,                     employees often refer to it as forced mandatory overtime  or simply forced                     overtime .
Mandatory Overtime Law
There is no Federal mandatory overtime law per se, that specifically regulates                     so-called forced overtime. The only Federal "overtime law" is                     under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) ,                     which also regulates equal pay , child                     labor and the minimum wage .
Mandatory Overtime under the FLSA
Federal overtime law under the FLSA does not prohibit employers from forcing                     employees to work mandatory overtime.
In fact, the FLSA doesn't at all restrict the total number of work hours                     that employers may schedule for employees who are age                     16 or older . The FLSA restricts work hours only for employees who are younger                     than age 16 .
In other words, there are no protections under the FLSA for workers 16                     and older who refuse to work mandatory overtime. As a result, workers 16                     and older who refuse to work it are "legally" subject to employer                     discipline, up to and including discharge .
If the related bill (or                       a future equivalent) passes, the Federal Safe                       Nursing and Patient Care Act of 2007 will restrict mandatory overtime                       for nurses at certain patient-care facilities that receive Medicare payments.                       Some states have already enacted equivalent laws, while others are considering                       it. Regardless, such restrictions are designed to protect patients more                       than nurses, from fatigue induced by mandatory overtime.
Under FLSA overtime law (exclusive of child-labor provisions),                     total daily and weekly work hours are a matter of contractual                     agreement between employers and employees or employers and unions .                     In the absence of contractual agreements that restrict work hours (such                     as collective                     bargaining agreements ), employers may effectively force employees to                     work any number of mandatory overtime hours within reason.
If you are protected by the Americans                         with Disabilities Act (ADA) or Rehabilitation                         Act , then your employer might be required to modify your mandatory                         overtime schedule to reasonably accommodate your disability .
Without union representation (or a potential disability protection mentioned                     above) and outside of filing a lawsuit, negotiating one-on-one or through                     your attorney is likely to be the only "legal" way                     to convince your employer to reduce your mandatory overtime work hours.                     If that fails, then you'll likely have little choice but to involuntarily                     work the forced overtime or quit for a better                     job .
The state (or municipality)                       in which you work might have enacted its own overtime law, that has more                       generous employee provisions than the FLSA. However, it's not likely                       to restrict the number of mandatory overtime hours for all workers. To                       find out, start by checking with the relevant state                       labor department or consult an attorney .
Mandatory Overtime Lawsuits
Employers can't always get away with forcing mandatory overtime, such                     as by "squeezing" current workers to avoid hiring new                     workers. Employee lawsuits against employers regarding excessive mandatory                     overtime are on the rise, particularly by salaried-exempt                     employees .
Because salaried-exempt employees are not eligible for overtime                       pay under the FLSA, employers may require them to work extra hours                       without extra pay. Even so, when forced, excessive work hours became                       the "norm" every workweek, some salaried-exempt employees filed                       and won so-called mandatory overtime lawsuits.
Consult an attorney about challenging                     your employer's forcing of excessive mandatory overtime, through a lawsuit.                     Overtime lawsuits are often class                     actions .
In contract negotiations, union workers too have won mandatory overtime                     concessions; for example, when employers forced it to avoid hiring new                     union workers. Consult your union rep about that.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and                         Health Administration (OSHA) published a Safety and Health Guide                         entitled " Extended/Unusual                         Work Shifts ". It recommends that employers grant extra meal                         and rest breaks when work shifts exceed eight hours per day; but,                         it's only a guide with no legal teeth.

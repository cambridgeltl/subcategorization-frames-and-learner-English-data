Variation in International Law
In most countries, paid parental leave (typically maternity leave) is available for those who have worked for their current employer for a certain period of time.
National legislations vary widely as it is a matter of politics to decide the appropriate type of parental leave legislation. The United States is the only Western country that does not mandate paid parental leave, although the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 mandates unpaid parental leave for the majority of American workers.
Legal requirements for parental leave benefits do not always reflect actual practice. In some countries with relatively weak requirements, individual employers choose to provide benefits beyond those required by law. In some countries, laws requiring parental leave benefits are widely ignored in practice.
A large majority of countries provide more than 10 paid weeks maternity leave. Only four provide none.

Europe
Central European countries are the most dedicated countries in the world regarding parental leave. In Czech Republic , it is standard that mothers stay at home for 3 years with every child. All mothers can decide to take 2, 3 or 4 years of maternity leave. It is also possible for the fathers to take the leave instead of the mothers but it is not common. For the whole period mothers are supported by the state. Similar model is also used in Austria where mothers can choose between 1 and 3 years. Also in Slovakia , standard duration of parental leave is 3 years, for handicapped child it is up to 6 years. State pays support 256 Euros per month for the first 2 years of age of the child. After this period it is 164.22 Euros per month.
Sweden is one country which provides generous parental leave: all working parents are entitled to 16 months paid leave per child, the cost being shared between employer and the state. To encourage greater paternal involvement in child-rearing, a minimum of 2 months out of the 16 is required to be used by the "minority" parent, in practice usually the father, and some Swedish political parties on the political left argue for legislation to oblige families to divide the 16 months equally between both parents.
Norway also has similarly generous leave. In Estonia mothers are entitled to 18 months of paid leave, starting up to 70 days before due date. Fathers are entitled to paid leave starting from the third month after birth (paid leave is however available to only one parent at a time).
In the UK , all female employees are entitled to 52 weeks of maternity (or adoption) leave, 39 weeks of which is paid, rising to 52 weeks paid from April 2010, with the first six weeks paid at 90% of full pay and the remainder at a fixed rate. Most employers offer a more generous policy. Annual leave continues to accrue throughout the maternity leave period. A spouse or partner of the woman (including same-sex relationships) may request a two week paid (at a fixed rate) paternity leave.

Americas
In 2000, parental leave was greatly expanded in Canada from 10 weeks to 35 weeks divided as desired between two parents. This is in addition to 15 weeks maternity leave. In most situations, a combination of maternity and parental benefits can be received up to a combined maximum of 50 weeks. In Canada maternity and parental leave is paid for by the Employment Insurance system.

Asia/Pacific
Australia will be introducing an 18 week paid maternity leave scheme starting in 2011. It is to be publicly funded, and to provide the federal minimum wage (currently AUS $543.78 a week) rather than a percentage of the primary caregiver's salary. It will not be available to families wherein the primary caregiver has an annual salary above $150,000.
From January 1, 2011, 18 weeks at federal minimum wage is provided.
Up to 52 weeks unpaid shared with father.
Up to 1 week unpaid taken at time of birth. Up to an additional 51 weeks if not taken at the same time as the mother, and for the purposes of providing primary care. Employer has right to refuse.
The 52 weeks are shared between the parents, and all leave must be completed before the child's first birthday.

International organizations
As international organizations are not subject to the legislation of any country, they have their own internal legislation on parental leave.
Organization
16 weeks  100% (however, no fewer than 10 weeks must be after delivery, even if the pre-delivery leave was longer due to a late birth)
4 weeks 100% (or 8 weeks for staff members serving at locations where they are not allowed to live with their family)
The fact that a staff member is or will be on parental leave cannot be a factor in deciding contract renewal. To ensure that this is enforced, if a contract ends while the staff member is on parental leave, the contract must be extended to cover the duration of such leave.

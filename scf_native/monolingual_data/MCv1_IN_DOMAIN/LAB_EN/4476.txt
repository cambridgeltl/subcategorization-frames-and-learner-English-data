Federal Labor Laws
About Federal Labor Laws
Federal labor laws  typically deal with employer-union relationships                     and Federal employment laws  typically deal with employer-employee                     relationships.
But the terms are used interchangeably, with labor laws  as the                     most common usage (as in the remainder of this text and throughout EmployeeIssues.com).
Laws are also called statutes . Regulations enforce                     them. Acts of congress                     establish Federal labor laws, as well as other Federal laws.
Act contents, explanations and interpretations by governmental and other                     qualified Web sites are linked below by act title. Acts that are not Federal                     labor laws per se, but that do have provisions related to some aspect of                     employment, are also included.
States are permitted to enact and enforce their own employment                     and labor laws that include or expand the minimum protections afforded                     by the Federal laws. To research state employment and labor laws on the                     Web, start in State Labor Laws .

Although it's not a Federal labor law per se, it does have provisions to                     protect the compensation and other benefits of airport security screeners                     hired by private screening companies. They are entitled to the same or                     better compensation and benefits as airport security screeners hired by                     the Federal Government (e.g., Transportation Security Administration).
COBRA requires employers to offer continued health-care                     insurance benefits at group rates to employees and their qualified beneficiaries,                     when a qualifying event occurs (such as reduction in work                     hours or layoffs ).

The CWHSSA is a Federal labor law that requires contractors with Federal contracts of                     over $100,000, to pay laborers and mechanics working under the contracts                     an overtime rate of at least 1.5 times their                     basic rate of pay. Also prohibits unsanitary, hazardous or dangerous working                     conditions on Federal construction projects.
A Federal labor law that requires contractors to pay local prevailing                     wages and fringe benefits to laborers and mechanics who construct,                     alter, or repair public buildings or public works. Applies to Federal government contracts of                     over $2,000 and requires each to include a clause that                     sets prevailing wages. See also the McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract                     Act  and the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act .
Not a written labor law, but a doctrine enforced                     by common law that                     presumes employment is voluntary for both employers and employees. Consequently,                     employers may terminate employees for any reason,                     no reason or even an unfair reason, just as employees may quit for                     same. (However, some states require employers to at least show good                     cause for termination. See also Model Employment Termination                     Act  below.) Some say this Doctrine was established at the Federal                     level by the 1908 Supreme Court case of Adair v. United States .

Requires contractors and grantees of Federal agencies to agree to provide                     drug-free workplaces before they may receive contracts or grants from Federal                     agencies. It was spawned by President Reagan's Executive                     Order 12564 , which also opened the door for private-sector employers                     to establish drug-free workplaces through drug                     testing . Consequently, many private-sector employers now follow the                     drug-testing guidelines published by the Department of Transportation (DOT)                     or the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).                     See Federal Labor Law Research for                     links to the aforementioned drug-testing guidelines.
Prohibits most private-sector employers                     from conducting lie detector tests on employees or job applicants. Also                     prohibits private-sector employers from using results of lie detector tests                     conducted elsewhere or refusals to take lie detector tests, as reasons                     for discharging or disciplining employees or denying employment to job applicants.
ERISA does not require private-sector employers                     to establish employee retirement plans. But, if employers do so voluntarily,                     then ERISA requires them to establish and maintain such plans fairly, soundly                     and with accountability. The same applies to voluntarily-established health                     plans and severance plans under ERISA.                     Also prohibits private-sector employers from terminating employees specifically                     to avoid granting vested pension rights. Amended by the Pension                     Protection Act of 2006 .
Not a Federal labor law, but the employment-related provisions regulate background                     checks on employees and job applicants to some degree. For example,                     an investigative agency can't conduct a credit                     check without a job applicant's permission and must disclose the applicant's                     rights under this Act, including the right to dispute an inaccurate credit                     report. The FCRA has been amended by other Acts since 1970.
This landmark Federal labor law, sometimes referred to as the Wages                     and Hours Act , regulates minimum wage , overtime                     pay , equal pay and child                     labor . The FLSA also prohibits employers from retaliating against                     employees who exercise their rights under the Act, such as reporting employer                     violations of the Act ( whistleblowing ).                     Additionally, along with other Federal laws and regulations, the FLSA and                     its regulations prohibit employers from controlling                     independent contractors as employees .
Although it's not a Federal labor law per se, its employment-related provisions                     entitle employees to take qui                     tam legal actions against their employers for defrauding the Federal                     Government, without fear of retaliation .                     Better yet, employees who sue under the FCA on behalf of the Federal Government                     receive a share of monetary damages awarded. One of the landmark whistleblower                     laws . Some states have passed their own versions, to deter and punish                     for fraud against state governments. Consult a lawyer about                     filing a False Claims Act (qui tam) lawsuit.
Another landmark Federal labor law that grants qualified employees up to                     12 weeks of medical leave per year to care for themselves or qualified                     family members, without losing their jobs or group health benefits. The                     Act does not require employers to pay employees                     while on medical leave, but some do anyway as a voluntary employee                     benefit . See also Family                     and Medical Leave .
Covers non-military, Federal employees with Workers' Compensation Insurance,                     which insures Federal employees against injury on the job. Although this                     Act covers only Federal government employees, most states have followed                     suit by passing laws that require private-sector and                     state-government employers to carry Workers' Compensation Insurance. See Workers'                     Compensation from Cornell Law School for an overview of this Act, plus                     related statutes, regulations and judicial decisions.

A tax law, not a Federal labor law. It does, however, require you to pay                     Social Security and Medicare taxes on earnings from                     your labor. Employers typically show such taxes as automatic payroll deductions                     labeled as "FICA" on employee paychecks. Quarterly self-employment                     taxes are the FICA equivalent for self-employed people.                     See also the Social Security Act  below.
Provisions related to employment and labor laws require most employers                     to pay both a Federal and state tax, to provide state unemployment                     benefits to eligible, unemployed workers. See also the information provided                     by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). For state unemployment tax information,                     see the Web site of the appropriate state                     unemployment office .
Grants qualified employees and their dependents who were previously covered                     by group health insurance (such as employer-provided or COBRA )                     the opportunity to enroll in a new plan. Also places limits on exclusions                     for preexisting conditions, and prohibits discrimination against employees                     and their dependents based on health. An amendment to the Employee                     Retirement Income Security Act  listed above. See also the related  Consolidated                     Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA)  listed above.
Not yet an act at                     this writing, but a 2005 bill reintroduced                     in March, 2007 by Senator Edward Kennedy. If it becomes an act, it will                     require employers in all states who employ 15 or more employees to provide                     at least minimal sick leave benefits with pay .                     The Act, as initially introduced, also has provisions for employees to                     take paid sick leave to care for family members.
This Act passed in 2002 amends Title                     38 of the U.S. Code. It gives veterans and disabled veterans priority                     for certain government training programs, and jobs with the Federal government                     and its contractors. Request information about eligibility, benefits and                     services available under this Act, through your local One-Stop                     Career Center or state unemployment                     office .

Among the landmark Federal Labor laws, it makes it unlawful for employers                     to interfere with, restrain, coerce ,                     discipline or discriminate against employees                     and job candidates for legit, union-related activities.                     Also called the Taft-Hartley Act . See also Labor-Management                     Reporting and Disclosure Act  ,  National Labor                     Relations Act  and National Right to Work Act .
The labor law provisions in this Act require contractors who are providing                     services to the Federal government under contracts of                     over $2,500, to pay prevailing wages to                     employees who work under the contracts. For contracts of $2,500 or less,                     contractors must pay at least the Federal minimum                     wage to employees who work under the contracts. Referred to as the Service                     Contract Act  for short. See also the Davis-Bacon Act  and                     the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act .
Protects miners from unsafe and unhealthy work conditions and practices.                     Also makes it unlawful for employers to discharge or                     discriminate against miners for reporting violations of the Act ( whistleblowing ),                     refusing to engage in any action made unlawful by the Act, or participating                     in any proceedings under                     the Act.
This is not a Federal labor law that requires mandatory state compliance,                     but any state may voluntarily adopt this Act. It protects qualified employees                     from wrongful termination by requiring                     covered employers to show good                     cause for employment termination. It also defines what constitutes "good                     cause" and makes it unlawful for employers to retaliate against                     employees for participating in proceedings under the Act. Start here to                     see if the state in which you work has adopted the Act.
This landmark labor law, also called the Wagner Act , protects                     workers from unfair labor practices by                     unions and employers, and authorizes the National Labor Relations Board                     to investigate violations. Unfair labor practices include interfering with                     workers' rights to union representation and discriminating against workers                     for their legit union activities. Search Job                     Tracker by Working America, an affiliate of the AFL-CIO, for companies                     in your area that are involved in court cases for accusations of violating                     workers' rights under this Act.

Not yet a Federal labor law at this writing, but a congressional bill .                     Its purpose is to "...protect the free choice of individual employees                     to form, join, or assist labor organizations, or to refrain from such activities." To                     achieve its purpose, it will repeal provisions in all other Federal labor                     laws that allow unionized workplaces to require workers to join the associated                     unions or pay union dues as a condition of employment. In the meantime,                     the Labor Management Relations Act  ( Taft-Hartley                     Act ) listed above allows states to enact their own right                     to work laws . See also National Labor Relations Act.
Nicknamed the No Fear Act , it makes Federal government                     employers more accountable than ever before, for violations of antidiscrimination and whistleblower protection                     laws in the Federal government workplace. The clever acronym No Fear  means                     that Federal employees may report such violations without fear of reprisal .
Replaced the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program with                     the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program. Commonly known                     as the Welfare Reform Bill signed by President Clinton, it provides temporary                     welfare assistance while encouraging and helping recipients to land paying                     jobs.
Protects the rights of railway and airline employees                     to organize and join unions, and forbids employer discrimination for same.                     (Provisions were extended in 1936 to include airline employees.) See also                     the National Right to Work Act , which, if it becomes law,                     will amend the Railway Labor Act.
Not a labor law, but a bill introduced                     in Congress (see also H.R.2122 ).                     If it passes, it will limit the number of mandatory                     overtime hours nurses must work at certain patient-care facilities                     that receive payments under the Medicare Program, to ensure quality patient                     care. It will also prohibit patient-care facilities from retaliating or                     otherwise discriminating against nurses                     who refuse to work mandatory overtime hours (as defined by the Act) or                     who report violations of the Act. If passed, it will amend Title XVIII                     of the Social Security Act  listed below.
The Social Security Act of 1935 authorized the Social Security Board, now                     the Social Security Administration (SSA), to provide retirement, disability ,                     Medicare health insurance, Supplemental Security Income, family, and survivors'                     benefits. It also launched the unemployment insurance system for state-provided unemployment                     benefits . Besides the text of the Act, this link also leads to rules,                     regulations and other research resources related to the Act.
A collection of statutes, regulations and other resources that assist Americans                     who've lost jobs, because of increased imports from or production shifts                     to other countries.

USERRA grants returning military members the right to be re-employed in                     the jobs that they would have attained if they were not absent for military                     service, with the same seniority, status and pay ,                     as well as other rights and employee                     benefits determined by seniority. Also prohibits job discrimination                     against veterans because of their military service. See also Employment                     Discrimination for Military Service and Veterans'                     Preference .
Through amendments, the VEOA strengthened and improved the related provisions                     in Title                     5 of the U.S. Code, to better entitle qualified ex-military members                     to receive veterans' preference for                     Federal government                     jobs . Also provides a path for veterans to file complaints against                     agencies that violate their preference rights under the Act. See also the full                     text of the Act, Employment Discrimination                     for Military Service and Veterans'                     Preference .
This old law is now codified as various provisions in Title                     5 of the U.S. Code. The provisions entitle qualified veterans to receive preference in                     hiring and retention for Federal government jobs. The provisions are periodically                     amended by newer laws, such as the Veterans' Employment Opportunities                     Act of 1998 .
A nickname for the Fair Labor Standards Act , which regulates minimum                     wage , overtime pay , equal                     pay and child labor at the Federal                     level. See the  Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA)  listing                     above for more information. See State Labor                     Laws to research wage and hour laws at the state level.
Requires contractors who furnish materials, supplies, articles, or equipment                     to the U.S. government or the District of Columbia per Federal contracts of                     over $10,000, to pay at least the federal minimum                     wage to employees who work under the contracts. Also requires contractors                     to pay overtime to the same employees at                     a rate of at least 1.5 times their base pay. See also the Davis-Bacon                     Act  and the McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract Act .
Another of the landmark labor laws, the WARN Act requires certain employers                     to issue notification of plant closings and mass layoffs to                     qualified, affected employees, at least 60 days in advance in most cases.

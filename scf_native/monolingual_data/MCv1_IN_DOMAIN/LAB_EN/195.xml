			<p id="p1">Updated in 2007 by Mrs. Judith Davila Monzon.</p>
			<p id="p2">Sources of regulation</p>
			<p id="p3">The main sources of law for termination of employment in Spain are the Workers’ Charter, [1] Royal Decree 2546/1994 of 29 December on recruitment, and Royal Legislative Decree 2/1995, which adopts the text which is recast in the Labour Procedure Act (LPA). In addition, art. 35 of the Spanish Constitution states that “all Spaniards have the duty to work and the right to work, to the free selection of their profession or office career, to advancement through work and to sufficient remuneration to satisfy their needs and those of their family, while in no case can there be discrimination for reasons of sex”. Some collective agreements also deal with this subject.</p>
			<p id="p4">In 1985, Spain ratified the ILO Termination of Employment Convention, 1982 (No. 158).</p>
			<p id="p5">Scope of legislation</p>
			<p id="p6">Labour legislation is to be applied to work done by Spanish workers hired in Spain and in Spanish undertakings in a foreign country.</p>
			<p id="p7">The Workers’ Charter is applied to workers who voluntarily provide remunerated services for another person and within the scope of organization and management of the other physical or legal person called the employer or entrepreneur. The following categories of workers and work are excluded from the scope of the law:</p>
			<p id="p8">staff in the service of the State, local government and autonomous public entities governed by other legislation;</p>
			<p id="p9">mandatory civil or community service;</p>
			<p id="p10">activity limited to the mere discharge of the duty of an adviser or member of the governing bodies of corporations where this activity entails the execution of tasks inherent in such duties;</p>
			<p id="p11">work carried out in the name of friendship, benevolence or good neighbourliness;</p>
			<p id="p12">family work, except if it is demonstrated that the persons doing the work have the status of wage earners; and</p>
			<p id="p13">the persons who are involved in trading operations on behalf of one or more employers, if they are personally responsible for the successful completion of the transaction and assume the risk of profit and loss.</p>
			<p id="p14">Contracts of employment</p>
			<p id="p15">A contract of employment is one in which a person provides service on behalf of and within the context of the organization and direction of another in exchange for pay. The employment contract may be concluded in writing or orally (sec. 8, Workers’ Charter).</p>
			<p id="p16">Contracts for a specified period over four weeks must be made in writing (sec. 8(2), Workers’ Charter).</p>
			<p id="p17">The employment contract may be concluded for an indeterminate or specific period (sec. 15(1), [2] Workers’ Charter). Fixed-term contracts can be concluded only in the following cases:</p>
			<p id="p18">When worker is hired to conclude a specific project or service, which is considered to be autonomous yet within the normal business activities of the employer and whose execution, although limited in the time, is in principle of unknown duration. </p>
			<p id="p19">When business demands are high and resources are stretched or there is backlog, even though the work maybe within the normal line of business of the employer. In such cases, contracts can be concluded for a maximum of 6 months within a twelve-month period. In some cases, the maximum length can be up to 18 months if worker’s union agreement so stipulates;</p>
			<p id="p20">When the contractor substitutes a worker entitled to return to work after leave (the name of the person being substituted and the reasons for temporary replacement must always be included in the contract) [3] .</p>
			<p id="p21">Sec. 14 of the Workers’ Charter provides for the possibility of written agreement on a probation period, the duration of which may not exceed six months for skilled technicians, or two months for other workers. In enterprises employing fewer than 25 workers the probation period may not exceed three months for workers who are not skilled technicians.</p>
			<p id="p22">Termination of employment</p>
			<p id="p23">Pursuant to sec. 49 of the Workers’ Charter, the employment contract may terminate, not at the employer’s initiative, for the following reasons:</p>
			<p id="p24">by mutual agreement of the parties;</p>
			<p id="p25">force majeure which puts a definitive end to the provision of the service;</p>
			<p id="p26">the expiration of the agreed term of the contract or the completion of the task or service for which the contract was concluded;</p>
			<p id="p27">resignation by the worker, upon the submission of notice provided for in the applicable collective agreements or by local practice;</p>
			<p id="p28">because of the death or serious or permanent total disability of the worker;</p>
			<p id="p29">retirement of the worker;</p>
			<p id="p30">death, retirement or incapacity of the employer, or the extinction of the legal personality of the contracting party;</p>
			<p id="p31">by the worker, because of contractual non-performance by the employer; or</p>
			<p id="p32">by decision of a female worker that feels obliged to leave her job as a consequence of being a victim of gender violence. [4]</p>
			<p id="p33">Sec.50 of Workers’ Charter deals with termination of a contract by will of the worker. The following are the instances prescribed:</p>
			<p id="p34">Substantial modifications of working conditions, which affect the worker’s vocational training or dignity; </p>
			<p id="p35">Lack of payment or continued delays in the guarantee of the negotiated salary; and </p>
			<p id="p36">Any other serious breach of the employer’s obligations, apart from force majeure.</p>
			<p id="p37">If the grounds are approved by the Social Affairs Court Judge, the worker is entitled to compensation as if it were an unjustified dismissal.</p>
			<p id="p38">In accordance with sec. 14(2) of the Workers’ Charter, during the probation period either party may end the employment relationship.</p>
			<p id="p39">Dismissal</p>
			<p id="p40">The employment contract may be terminated because of the following valid reasons (sec. 52, Workers’ Charter):</p>
			<p id="p41">the inaptitude of the worker which is known or later demonstrated, after his or her actual placement in the enterprise. Existing inaptitude observed before the completion of a probation period may not be alleged after such completion;</p>
			<p id="p42">the worker’s failure to adapt to the technical modification of his or her job, if such changes are reasonable and have occurred after a minimum of two months from the introduction of the modification;</p>
			<p id="p43">the existence of an objectively substantiated need to fill posts for any of the reasons specified in sec. 51 (discussed below);</p>
			<p id="p44">absence from work, even justified but intermittent, which amounts to 20 per cent of the working days in two consecutive months, or 25 per cent in four discontinuous months within a period of 12 months, if the rate of absenteeism of the total workforce exceeds 5 per cent during the same periods. However, the following will not be considered as absenteeism: legal strikes, employees’ representative activities, labour accidents, maternity leave, vacations, temporary absence from work of more than 20 consecutives days due to sickness or non-employment-related accidents, and/or physical or psychological situation due to gender violence; [5] and</p>
			<p id="p45">when in indefinite-term contracts arranged directly by public authorities or not-for-profit entities to implement certain public plans and programs, the projects are unable to continue due to insufficient budgetary appropriations. [6]</p>
			<p id="p46">The employment contract may be terminated by the employer through dismissal based on serious and culpable non-performance on the part of the worker (disciplinary dismissal). The following are considered non-performance of contractual obligations (sec. 54, Workers’ Charter):</p>
			<p id="p47">repeated and unjustified absence or lateness in the workplace;</p>
			<p id="p48">indiscipline or disobedience at work;</p>
			<p id="p49">verbal or physical offences against the employer or persons employed in the enterprise or the family living with them;</p>
			<p id="p50">violation of contractual goodwill, and abuse of confidence in the discharge of duties;</p>
			<p id="p51">continued and voluntary reduction of normal or agreed output;</p>
			<p id="p52">habitual drunkenness or drug addiction if it adversely affects the worker’s work; and</p>
			<p id="p53">harassment based on race or ethnic origin, religious beliefs or conviction, disability, age or sexual orientation against the employer or other persons working at the company. [7]</p>
			<p id="p54">Collective dismissal is classified as the termination of employment contracts based on economic, technical, organizational or productive reasons within a period of 90 days, which affects at least (sec. 51, Workers’ Charter):</p>
			<p id="p55">ten workers, in enterprises which employ fewer than 100 workers;</p>
			<p id="p56">10 per cent of the number of workers in enterprises which employ between 100 and 300 workers; or</p>
			<p id="p57">30 workers in enterprises which employ more than 300 workers.</p>
			<p id="p58">The termination of employment contracts of the undertaking’s entire workforce of five or more workers is also considered a collective dismissal.</p>
			<p id="p59">In Spain, the anti-discrimination provisions of the Workers’ Charter prohibit termination of employment on the basis of sex, ethnic origin, marital status, race, social status, religious or political beliefs, membership or non-membership of a trade union, or language (secs. 4(2) and 17(1), Workers’ Charter). To this is added protection contained in the Act on Social Integration of the Disabled (No. 12/1982 of 31 March 1982), which extends this protection to disability status. Any termination of employment based on the above-mentioned grounds is considered to be null and void. In addition, a termination is null in the following cases: pregnant workers during the period of suspension of the contract due to maternity, risk during pregnancy, or breast-feeding leave; adoption or fostering; family leave to care for children or handicapped persons; and in certain circumstances female workers who have been victim of gender violence. [8] The worker may be reinstated or paid his or her wages indefinitely, including continued coverage by the social security system (sec. 12, LPA), without prejudice to other possible civil liability to which the employer may be subject.</p>
			<p id="p60">Notice and prior procedural safeguards</p>
			<p id="p61">Termination of the employment contract for objective reasons requires the observance of the following criteria (sec. 53(1), Workers’ Charter):</p>
			<p id="p62">written communication to be given to the worker explaining the reason;</p>
			<p id="p63">payment to made to the worker, at the same time at which the written communication is handed over, of compensation corresponding to 20 days for each year of service (periods of time under one year are to be prorated by months), up to a maximum sum of 12 months’ pay; and</p>
			<p id="p64">granting to the worker a 30-day notice period.</p>
			<p id="p65">In the case of termination of employment for misconduct, the dismissal must be notified in writing to the worker, stating the facts justifying the dismissal and indicating the date on which the employment relationship will end (sec. 55(1), Workers’ Charter).</p>
			<p id="p66">If the worker is a workers’ legal representative or a trade union representative, there will be formal adversarial procedures during which the worker concerned, and other members of the union to which he or she belongs, may be heard. If the worker happens to be a member of a trade union and the employer is aware of this fact, representatives of the corresponding trade union must be heard in advance.</p>
			<p id="p67">An employer who intends to carry out collective dismissals must request permission from the competent labour authority and at the same time must consult the legal representative of the workers. The communication to the labour authority and to the legal representatives must be accompanied by all the necessary documentation justifying the reasons for the dismissal and the measures which are to be adopted, in the terms prescribed by regulation. Once the request has been received by the labour authority, it will ascertain whether the request fulfils the necessary requirements, and if it does not, the employer must rectify the situation within ten days (sec. 51(2) and (3), Workers’ Charter). Consultation with the legal representatives of the workers should last not less than 30 calendar days, or a fortnight in the case of enterprises employing fewer than 50 workers (sec. 51(4), Workers’ Charter). At the end of the process of consultation, the employer must communicate to the labour authority the outcome of the deliberations. If there is an agreement between the parties, the labour authority must hand down a decision within a fortnight. However, if the labour authority determines, ex officio or at the request of the party concerned, the commission of fraud, damage, coercion or abuse of law in the conclusion of the agreement, it will submit its decision to the judicial authority, with a suspension of the time limit to make the decision (sec. 51(5), Workers’ Charter). In the event that the period of consultation is concluded without agreement, the labour authority must hand down a decision within a period of 15 calendar days. The decision of the labour authority must be justified and compatible with the wishes of the enterprise (sec. 51(6), Workers’ Charter).</p>
			<p id="p68">Severance pay</p>
			<p id="p69">Workers dismissed for valid reasons receive compensation of 20 days’ wages for each year of service, up to a maximum sum of 12 months’ pay (for periods of service under a year, this is prorated by the number of months of service) (sec. 53(1)(b), Workers’ Charter).</p>
			<p id="p70">Workers who are unlawfully dismissed receive compensation of 45 days’ wages for each year of service, up to a maximum of 42 months’ pay (for periods under a year, this is prorated by the number of months of service). Compensation will also be awarded for the sum of the outstanding wages from the date of dismissal up to notification of the decision that the dismissal was unlawful or until the worker has found alternative employment if such placement took place before the decision was handed down. If the employer acknowledges that the dismissal was unjustified and places a deposit (equivalent to the statutory severance and salaries) at the relevant Labour Court, compensation will be from the date of dismissal until the date deposit, provided that he/she informs the dismissed worker of the deposit. However, if the deposit is made at Court within 48 hours after the dismissal, no salaries will accrue during the proceeding (sec. 56(1)(a) and (b), (2) Workers’ Charter). [9]</p>
			<p id="p71">The employer can claim to the State payment of the outstanding wages referred to in sec. 56 (1) (b), when the Court took longer than sixty working days to make a decision. The sum claim will correspond to the time exceeded beyond the sixty working days. [10]</p>
			<p id="p72">Collective dismissal leads to severance payments equal to compensation of 20 days’ wages for each year of service, up to a maximum of 12 months’ pay (for periods of under a year, this is prorated by the number of months of service) (sec. 51(8), Workers’ Charter). In undertakings employing fewer than 25 workers, the Wage Guarantee Fund must pay 40 per cent of the legal compensation due to the workers (sec. 33(8), Workers’ Charter). </p>
			<p id="p73">In the case of termination of fixed-term contracts (sec. 49 (1)(c)), the worker is entitled to receive severance equal to 8 days’ salary per year worked. [11] This does not apply to workers contracted to substitute employees entitled to return to their job or apprentice contracts.</p>
			<p id="p74">Avenues for redress</p>
			<p id="p75">In the event of dismissal the possible channels of recourse which may be made before the labour court are: appeal, cassation and review. The time limit for appeal is 20 working days for both disciplinary dismissal and dismissal for objective reasons (secs. 103 and 121, LPA). </p>
			<p id="p76">If the employer does not fulfil the requirements established under sec. 53(1), the decision to terminate employment will be declared null and void, [12] and the employer will be instructed to pay the worker, according to the provisions applicable in the event of disciplinary dismissal (sec. 53(4), Workers’ Charter). The wages due during the period of deliberations may not be deducted from the wages corresponding to the notice period (sec. 123(2), LPA).</p>
			<p id="p77">If dismissal is declared unlawful, within a period of five days from the notification of the decision, the employer must make a choice between the reinstatement of the worker and payment of a sum of money. [13] Electing compensation is only an option if the person dismissed was a workers’ legal representative or a union representative. By not exercising this option, it will be taken that reinstatement has been chosen. Whenever the option, expressed or presumed, is exercised in favour of reinstatement, it will be legally binding (sec. 56(4), Workers’ Charter).</p>
			<p id="p78">If dismissal is carried out in a manner which does not comply with the provisions of sec. 55(1) of the Workers’ Charter, the employer may renew the dismissal complying with the requirements omitted in the previous case, within 20 consecutive days of the initial dismissal (sec. 55(2), (5) and (6), Workers’ Charter).</p>
			<p id="p79">A dismissal which fails to observe the rules of procedure will be declared null and void. In the case of annulment, the decision will be in favour of the immediate reinstatement of the worker with payment of outstanding wages (sec. 113, LPA).</p>
			<p id="p80">The judicial body, ex officio or at the request of the party concerned, will declare null and void the agreement taken by the employer to effect collective dismissal for economic, technical, organizational or productive reasons, force majeure or extinction of the legal personality of the employer if prior administrative authorization has not been obtained (sec. 124, LPA). In such cases the ruling will be determined by sec. 113 of the LPA, namely, reinstatement of the worker with payment of outstanding wages.</p>

Sources of regulation
The Labour Act, 1990 (LA), is the major source of law in       Gambia in relation to termination of employment at the initiative of the       employer.
Scope of legislation
The following categories of workers are excluded from all       of the provisions of the LA: civil servants, members of the naval, military,       prison and security services, police officers and domestic workers ( sec.       2(2) , LA).
The following workers are excluded from the provision of       the LA dealing with termination of employment: any employee over 55 who       has reached a contractual retirement age; any employee over 65; a probationary       employee; and any employee whose dismissal is certified as being in accordance       with the national interest by the Secretary of the Cabinet.
Contracts of employment
Contracts of employment may be for a fixed term or for       an indefinite period. A fixed-term contract will expire on the specific       date indicated in the contract or when the specific task, piece of work       or journey to which the contract relates has been finished ( sec. 83 ,       LA). However, if the specific period, task, piece of work or journey expires       or is performed, but the employment continues without protest for four       weeks thereafter, the contract is deemed to have been immediately renewed       for an indefinite period ( sec. 83(4) , LA). Probationary periods       are permissible, but may not exceed six months.
Termination of employment
The contract of employment can terminate, not at the initiative       of the employer, in certain circumstances, including by:
employee         retirement;
the         completion of the task for which the contract was concluded.
Moreover, unless the contract expressly provides to the       contrary, the death of the employer will cause the contract of employment       to terminate after one month from the date of such death, unless the contract       has been lawfully terminated sooner. The personal representative of the       deceased shall be deemed to be the employer during such time as the contract       continues ( sec. 80 , LA). [1]
According to sec. 80(2) of the LA, the compulsory       winding-up of any company or organization shall operate to terminate any       contract of employment with that company or organization, but shall not       prevent renewal of that contract by the receiver or other person carrying       on the business of the company or organization. If such contract is renewed       within two months of such termination, it shall be deemed not to have been       terminated.
Where a trade or business is transferred in whole or in       part, save by a receiver upon the insolvency of the business, [2]
the contracts       of employment of all employees at the date of transfer shall automatically       be transferred to the transferee and all rights and obligations between       the employer and the transferor shall continue to apply as if they had       been rights and obligations between the employee and the transferee ( sec.       74(2) , LA).
Dismissal
An employer is required to justify a dismissal of his or       her employee. Dismissal will be justified in cases of incapacity or misconduct,       such as:
wilful         misconduct;
omission         or disobedience by the worker which, by its nature and the circumstances         in which it occurs, is such that no reasonable employer would expect       the employment to continue;
serious         or persistent insubordination;
incompetence;
a         single long period of absence without substantial reason;
unreasonable         refusal to accept other suitable employment in cases where the enterprise         needs such redeployment; or
wilful         destruction or obstruction of safety equipment available for use ( sec.         116 , LA).
Summary dismissal is allowed in the following circumstances:
when         the employee is guilty of serious misconduct;
where,         within three months of engagement, the employer has reasonable grounds         to believe that the employee lacks the skill or ability which he or she         has represented himself or herself to possess and which the law requires         should be possessed by an employee for performing the specified work;       or
where         the contract of employment is void for misrepresentation ( sec. 112 ,         LA).
Where the employer does not provide reasons for dismissal       when requested by the employee, such dismissal is deemed unfair ( sec.       114(1) , LA). Where such a dismissal takes place before completion of       any period wherein wages become due, the employee shall be paid a proportionate       part of the wages then due ( sec. 112(2) , LA).
Under sec. 117 of the LA, the following constitute       invalid reasons for dismissal:
pregnancy;
the         fact that the employee has taken maternity leave;
participation         in trade union activities, including the organization of lawful industrial         action outside working hours or, with the express consent of the employer,         within working hours;
membership         of a trade union;  
refusal         or indication of an intention to refuse to join any organization of workers;
a         period of absence by reason of illness or injury of less than two weeks         unless the employee, on the reasonable request of the employer, fails       to supply reasonable independent evidence that he or she was incapacitated         for the whole period;
instigation         by the police of investigations involving the employee concerning a matter         not connected with suitability of the employee for a particular employment;
a         single instance of absenteeism, not being a long unexplained absence       so as to justify summary dismissal;
taking         of steps by the employee to enforce any right granted or any obligation         imposed upon the employer;
refusal         by the employee in any circumstances, save those of grave national emergency         or of grave emergency applicable to the employer, to work for more than         the number of hours permitted by any rule of law or international convention;
any         political activity engaged in or political opinion expressed by the employee;         and
the         dismissal of an apprentice, unless the dismissal is necessitated by personal         injury or wilful act by the apprentice, or the employer is going out       of business.
When collective dismissal is being considered, the employer       has to provide the relevant trade unions with written information concerning       the circumstances giving rise to the need for dismissal, possible alternative       options and whether they are feasible, whether redeployment or retraining       has been considered, whether it is reasonably possible that a certain number       of employees might be re-employed during the next year, and the principles       which will be taken into account when deciding on whom to dismiss (such       as last in, first out). The employer must then consult with relevant       trade unions ( sec. 119 , LA).
The provisions governing collective dismissal shall not       apply to employers with five or less employees in all his or her establishments,       or where a collective agreement governs the conditions of collective dismissal       (sec. 119(3), LA).
Notice and prior procedural safeguards
Notice is mandatory for all cases of dismissal except summary       dismissal. In cases where it is customary to employ individuals on a day-to-day       basis, notice shall be given at the end of the day ( sec. 111(1)(a) ,       LA). This notice shall be deemed to have been given by specifying that       the contract will last for one (additional) day only. For all others, notice       periods are as follows:
in         the case of an employee not employed on a day-to-day basis, but who has         been employed for less than one weeks continuous employment with the       same employer, 24 hours notice ( sec. 111(1)(b) , LA);
in         the case of an employee with one week or more of continuous employment         but less than six months continuous employment with the same employer,         one weeks notice ( sec. 111(1)(d) , LA);
in         the case of an employee with six months or more but less than six years         of continuous employment with the same employer, one months notice ( sec.         111(1)(c) and (e) , LA); and
in         the case of an employee with six years or more of continuous employment         with the same employer, two months notice ( sec. 111(1)(f) ,         LA).  
Under sec. 109 , requirements for notice are excluded           in the cases of:
any         employee who has attained the age fixed for retirement in accordance       with sec.         90  [3] or the age of         65 years, whichever is earlier;
termination         of the employment relationship during the probation period;
any         employee whose dismissal is certified by the Secretary of the Cabinet       as being in the national interest;
a         summary dismissal;
the         payment of wages in lieu of notice (that is, a sum equivalent to the       basic wage payable for the period of notice ( sec. 111 , LA); and
for         fixed-term employees, provided that the contract has not been renewed       immediately after expiration. [4]
Before dismissal takes place, the employee has to be informed       about the reasons for dismissal and has to be given a reasonable chance       to respond ( sec. 113 , LA). The dismissed employee has the right       to approach the Industrial Tribunal (sec. 121 , LA). Such an employee       also has the right to be represented by a trade union representative ( sec.       113 , LA). Where the employer does not comply with these conditions,       it will constitute an unfair dismissal, unless the employer can prove that       the employee was aware of these rights ( sec. 113(3) and (4) , LA).       The Industrial Tribunal has jurisdiction over dismissal disputes ( sec.       21(2) , LA). Any party who is aggrieved by a decision may appeal to       the Supreme Court whose decision is final ( sec. 43(1) , LA).
Severance pay
In the case of summary dismissal, the employee must be       paid any remuneration or benefits accruing to him or her up until the date       of the dismissal ( sec. 112(2) , LA).
Avenues for redress
The Industrial Labour Tribunal has jurisdiction over all       types of dismissal claims ( sec. 112 , LA). Claims can be filed with       the Industrial Tribunal within six months from the date of dismissal. The       burden of proof rests with the employer ( sec. 115 , LA). Where the       employer cannot prove the reasons for dismissal, such dismissal will be       deemed unfair. In cases where no settlement is reached by the parties,       the Industrial Tribunal has jurisdiction to order reinstatement or compensation       or both. The Industrial Tribunal has the power to award such compensation       as it considers just and equitable, although this amount can be reduced       by reason of the conduct of the employee in contributing to his or her       dismissal or in failing to mitigate the loss he or she has suffered ( sec.       123 , LA). According to sec. 123(3) , the court will also consider, inter       alia , other job opportunities available, the value of contractual benefits       to which the employee might reasonably have expected to become entitled       to had he or she not been dismissed; and the value of statutory rights       such as pensions or other accrued benefits.
Further information
[2] The transferee will, in these circumstances,       not be liable for the debts of the insolvent undertaking.
[3] Sec. 90 stipulates that a term in a contract of employment, fixing         a retirement age for an employee at any age after reaching his or her         55th birthday, shall be valid and enforceable, and termination in accordance         with such provision shall not amount to a dismissal.
[4] It thus seems that the premature termination       of a fixed-term contract would also not require notice.

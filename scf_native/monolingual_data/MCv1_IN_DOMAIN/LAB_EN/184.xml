			<p id="p56">Equal pay</p>
			<p id="p57">At workplaces equal pay for men and women for work of equal value is a must, regardless of marital status. Pay inequality based on religion, race or ethnic background is also forbidden. A transparent remuneration system and the clear matching of pay and position are in place and help to prevent wage discrimination.</p>

All children should be able to attend school. Once this is safeguarded there is no objection against children performing light jobs between the ages of 12 and 14.</p>
			<p id="p64">Hazardous jobs</p>
			<p id="p65">ILO Conventions:</p>
			<p id="p66">Conventions 29 (1930) and 105 (1957) specify the qualifications of forced labour. It is work one has to perform under threat of punishment: forfeit of wages, dismissal, harrassment or violence, even corporal punishment. Forced labour means violation of human rights.</p>
			<p id="p67">Freedom to change jobs</p>
			<p id="p68">Employers have to allow you to look for work elsewhere. If you do, you should not be shortened on wages or threatened with dismissal. (In the reverse cases international law considers this as forced labour).</p>
			<p id="p69">No passport or ID</p>
			<p id="p70">You should hold your own passport or ID. Not your employer. (One of the indicators of forced labour is whether the worker can freely use their passport or ID. Too often still, especially in the context of migration, the employer confiscates this personal document. Whenever this happens it is a matter of forced labour.)</p>
			<p id="p71">Pay back loan</p>
			<p id="p72">When you do not receive any pay since you still have not yet fully paid back the personal loan provided by your employer, this is considered to be forced labour.</p>
			<p id="p73">Trade union at work</p>
			<p id="p74">Trade unions are entitled to negotiate with employers on term of employment without hindrance. The freedom of a trade union to negotiate with employers to try and conclude collective agreements is protected.

			<p id="p76">Freedom of association means freedom to join a trade union. This is part of the fundamental human rights. Employees may not be put at a disadvantage when they are active in the trade union outside working hours.</p>

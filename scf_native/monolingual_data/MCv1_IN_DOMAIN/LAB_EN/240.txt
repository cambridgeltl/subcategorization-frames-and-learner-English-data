SOCIAL                                                SECURITY & LABOUR ARRANGEMENTS
What standards?
The                                            legal arrangements with regards to social                                            security and labour in Turkey are in                                            line with the ILO (International Labour                                            Organisation) and other generally accepted                                            international standards.
The Compulsory Social Insurance                                                  Schemes
Social insurance schemes                                      are compulsory for both employees and the                                      self-employed Turkish nationals. The social                                      insurance schemes for the self-employed and                                      employees are Bag-Kur and SSK, respectively.
These schemes cover the                                      following risks: Old-age, invalidity, sickness,                                      maternity, work injuries & occupational                                      diseases, mortality. Thus, having paid social                                      insurance contributions on behalf of the employees,                                      employers are not to pay for any costs associated                                      with the compensation of those risks confronted                                      by employees.
In addition, for foreign                                      nationals working in Turkey, only short-term                                      risks (maternity leave, sickness, work injuries                                      and occupational diseases) are covered by                                      the associated scheme. On the other hand,                                      foreign citizens can voluntarily register                                      to social insurance institutions for the long-term                                      risk coverage (invalidity, old-age, mortality).                                      However, citizens of the countries with which                                      reciprocity agreements in the power of law                                      have been made are to be fully covered (compulsory)                                      by the relevant social insurance scheme. These                                      countries are UK, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium,                                      Austria, Switzerland, France, Sweden, Libya,                                      Denmark, Norway, and Turkish Republic of Northern                                      Cyprus.
Old-age,                                                  invalidity, sickness, maternity,                                                  work injuries & occupational diseases, mortality

Maximum:                                            YTL 1,499.91 (approximately £ 539)
Employees covered by SSK                                      are also to be covered by the Unemployment                                      Insurance.
The Unemployment Insurance                                      contribution rates (in percent of the contribution                                      base for an employee) are as follows:

Provision of basic health services
The State provides its                                      residents with all basic health services and                                      medication. The basic package includes a very                                      wide range of services and healthcare products,                                      and thus is generous when compared to international                                      ones. The associated costs of people under                                      the coverage of social insurance are financed                                      by the social insurance institutions. Those                                      for the poor, on the other hand, are financed                                      by the State social assistance funds.
With regard to the basic                                      health insurance, residents can use either                                      State hospitals or the private healthcare                                      providers with whom the Social Insurance institutions                                      have made contracts.
If a resident demands                                      some services not included in the basic healthcare                                      package, he/she has to finance the additional                                      costs.
Private Pension Schemes and Private                                                  Health Insurance
Private pension schemes                                      (individual savings accounts/Defined Contribution                                      type pension funds) are voluntary .
Moreover, since the basic                                      health insurance is provided by the State,                                      private health insurance is voluntary .
However, some employers                                      opt to provide their employees with private                                      pension or health insurance products designated                                      for institutional clients so as to increase                                      loyalty to their companies.
Severance Pay
An employer is free to                                      fire the employees. In addition, employees                                      may leave the work for reasons such as military                                      service (men), maternity (women) and retirement.                                      If one of these events occurs, the employer                                      has to pay a Severance Pay to the leaving/fired                                      employee.
Severance Pay (SP) is                                      calculated as follows:
SP= Number of years                                      the Employee worked for the company * Recent                                      Monthly Salary of the Employee
However, the recent monthly                                      salary term cannot exceed YTL 1,727.15 (approximately,                                      £640). The official ceiling on this                                      term is periodically updated by the Government.
In case an employer fires                                      an employee due to an unacceptable behaviour                                      (as defined by the Labour Law) of the employee,                                      then no severance pay is made by the employer.
Unions and collective bargaining
According to Unions Act                                      No. 2821, being a member of any union is voluntary  for both employers and employees.
On the other hand, collective                                      bargaining agreements are contained in the                                      Collective Bargaining Agreements, Strikes,                                      and Lock Outs Act No. 2822. These agreements                                      can be signed between
the authorised employers’ union (or the                                        employer in case the employer has not registered                                        by any employer union) and
the                                        authorised trade union (authorisation is                                        only possible when a trade union covers                                        at least 50% of workers in a workplace and                                        at least 10% of the workers in the relevant                                        industry).
Collective bargaining                                      agreements are benefited by workers registered                                      to a trade union.
Employment of the disabled, terror                                                  victims and former-prisoners
So as to prevent social unrest, the labour law makes enterprises with 50 or more employees  employ
disabled                                        people
The Council of Ministers                                      periodically determines the respective composition                                      of those groups.
The wages to be paid                                      to the people in this category cannot be less                                      than the minimum wage.
However, some private                                      companies evade this regulation since (monetary)                                      penalties chargeable in case non-compliance                                      is detected by work inspectors are not significant.
Establishing a workplace health                                                  unit
Enterprises with 50                                      or more employees  have to set up                                      a health unit which will be in charge of
defining                                        biological, chemical and physical risks                                        of the work and workplace,
prevention                                        of those risks,
periodical                                        measurement, analysis and control of the                                        relevant parameters.
A workplace health unit                                      is composed of a doctor and a nurse  (or a health officer) both of who have been                                      licensed by the Ministry of Labour and Social                                      Security. Depending on the number people employed                                      and the level of risks, part-time or full-time                                      employment of those health personnel is possible.
Recruitment of a work safety expert
An enterprise with 50                                      or more employees  has to sign a contract                                      with a work safety expert who has been licensed                                      by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security                                      and who will periodically visit and supervise                                      the workplace. Instead of hiring such an external                                      person, employers can assign one of their                                      engineers to carry out the activities supposed                                      to be done by an expert. In that case, the engineer in question has to be licensed by                                      the Ministry and is supposed not to do any                                      other job during the times allocated for work                                      safety supervision.
WAGES & COST TO EMPLOYER
Minimum Wage
Gross wages cannot be                                      less than the national minimum (gross) wage,                                      which is currently YTL 608  per month (approximately £ 260 per month)                                      for employees at the age of 16 or more. (The                                      cost to employer is YTL 738.72/employee).                                      The gross wage will be YTL 638 and the cost                                      to employer will be YTL 775.17 from 1st July                                      2008.
In                                      other words, if you establish a firm and recruit                                      employees in Turkey, the monthly minimum labour                                      cost will amount to approximately £318/employee @2,32 on 2 Jan 2008.
Minimum wage is applied nation-wide and updated                                      periodically. The Minimum Wage Commission                                      composed of the social partners advices the                                      Government on what the minimum wage ought                                      to be, and the Government determines the amount                                      taking into account this advised figure.
Average wages in the industry
In the manufacturing sector,                                      gross wages for blue collar workers start                                      from £318 per month. For example, in                                      Istanbul, the most expensive province in Turkey,                                      a net wage of £350-£600 is attractive                                      enough for an average blue collar worker.
With regard to an average                                      white collar worker (an engineer or a person                                      in charge of office works in departments such                                      as accounting, marketing), gross wage starts                                      from £350. In Istanbul, a net wage of                                      £450-750 is attractive enough for an                                      average white collar worker.
Very skilful white-collar                                      workers, engineers or managers (even top managers)                                      who graduated from Turkey’s top universities                                      and have very good command of English can                                      be employed at a net salary of £900-to-£3000                                      per month in Istanbul.
The above figures were                                      obtained from some of the licensed human resources                                      bureaus in Turkey. The reason why wages in                                      Istanbul are used in this section is that                                      it is the most expensive city in Turkey. In                                      other provinces, wages are lower.

As explained in the above                                      sections, total cost of an employee to the                                      employer is the gross wage plus social insurance                                      and unemployment insurance contributions made                                      by the employer (employer’s total contribution                                      is 21.5% of the contribution base. For workplaces                                      with high work safety risks the rate may extend                                      to a level up to 27%).
To give some examples,
1.  A worker works for an enterprise which was                                      rated as ‘high risk’ and is paid                                      a monthly gross salary of £350. His                                      total cost to the employer is then
£ 444.5 (=350+ 27%*350)
2.  A company manager works                                      under no-work injury risk conditions and is                                      paid a gross salary of £2000 per month.                                      Taking into account that the gross salary                                      exceeds the contribution base ceiling of £1700,                                      his total cost to the employer is £                                      2365.50 (=2000+ 21.5%*1700)
How to calculate a net wage?
Since negotiations on                                      wages are generally based on net terms, it                                      is important to know how to calculate a net                                      wage. A net wage is calculated as follows:
Net Wage= Gross Wage                                      - Social insurance and unemployment insurance                                      contributions by the employee - taxes (personal                                      income tax and stamp tax)
As explained in the relevant                                      sections, social insurance and unemployment                                      insurance contributions to be made by an employee                                      are 14% and 1% of the contribution base, respectively.
On the other hand, the personal                                      income tax rates start from 15%. The stamp                                      tax rate for wages is 0.6%. The personal income                                      and stamp taxes are applied to the amount                                      to be calculated to equal “the gross                                      wage minus employee’s contributions”.
To give an example, suppose                                      that an employee earns a gross wage of £300                                      per month and he is in the lowest income bracket                                      (income tax rate of 15%). Then the net salary                                      to be paid to him (£215.2) is calculated                                      as follows:
£215.2 =300- 300*(14%+1%)                                      - [300- 300*(14%+1%)]*(15%+0.6%)
WORKING                                                HOURS & HOLIDAYS
Number of normal working                                      hours for an employee is 45 hours per week.
If the total number of                                      working hours exceeds 45 hours, the difference                                      between it and 45 is considered as overtime                                      and the overtime work is granted 50% extra                                      wage.
In a year, total amount                                      of overtime cannot exceed 270 hours.
An employee cannot be                                      forced to work for more than 11 hours a day.                                      Moreover, he/she cannot work for more than                                      7.5 hours between 8.00 pm and 6.00 am (night).
Employers can ask their                                      employees to work in shifts provided that                                      they carry out some formalities (such as informing                                      Regional Labour Directorate about the issue)                                      defined by the relevant regulations. Number                                      of shifts must be at least 3 and for an employee                                      the interval between two consecutive shifts                                      cannot be shorter than 11 hours.
An employee must be granted                                      a holiday of at least 24 hours (continuous)                                      per week.
Leave with pay
Employers have to let                                      their employees have “leave with pay”.                                      The duration of the leave depends on the number                                      of years worked.
Number                                                  of Years Worked

Religious Festivals (Festivals of                                              Sacrifice and Ramadan)
In the Turkish labour                                      market, generally, two methods are used:
Enterprises                                              which want to employ new personnel                                              have job/vacancy advertisements published                                              in daily newspapers with high circulation                                              rates. Then interested parties (applicants)                                              are invited to interviews or skill                                              tests by those enterprises. Terms                                              are freely agreed by the parties.
Some enterprises prefer using the licensed                                        employment bureaus since those bureaus have                                        broad databases and good expertise in selecting                                        qualified people on behalf of their clients,                                        and provide very wide range of industrial                                        training programs. Thus, enterprises just                                        clearly define what labour qualifications                                        they are seeking, the number of personnel                                        needed and the average wages etc and then                                        employment bureaus find candidates for the                                        vacancies.

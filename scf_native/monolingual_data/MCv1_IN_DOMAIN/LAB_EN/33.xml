			<p id="p3">Enter Your Email:</p>
			<p id="p4">Once you've found a job the law will make sure your employer takes good cares of you.</p>
			<p id="p5">The first step in landing a job on the German economy should be contact with the personnel department of the prospective employer. A resumé (C.V.) should accompany the contact. German resumes are customarily very detailed and include a complete education and work experience summary. It's also a good idea to include copies of citations, letters of recommendation and other documents you think will impress the potential employer; and a recent photograph.</p>
			<p id="p6">You may be required to fill out a job application, and there probably will be an interview. Prospective employers are permitted under the law to ask questions as to an applicant's health and criminal record, if any, but they may not ask a woman whether she is pregnant. Employment interviews are formal in Germany. Dress accordingly and don't get too friendly or familiar with the interviewer.</p>
			<p id="p7">If you work for a German firm you'll be subject not only to German taxes but also to premiums for various health, unemployment and retirement plans. (See the separate articles on benefits and health care .) These can take a bite out of your take-home pay. If you don't intend to work in Germany the rest of your life, it may be possible to be exempted from payments to the retirement insurance (Rentenversicherung) or to collect any money you have contributed when you leave.</p>
			<p id="p8">On the positive side, you might get a housing subsidy (Wohngeld) to help with your rent and a child subsidy (Kindergeld) to help with the raising of your children. Often a company will also subsidize the cost of getting to work, and perhaps pay all or part of the cost of your lunch.</p>
			<p id="p9">If hired, an employee must usually expect a probationary period of three to six months, during which time he or she can be dismissed with two weeks' or one month's notice. Once you have successfully weathered this probation it becomes difficult for the company to dismiss you. It must convince the unions and/or labor court that the reasons are very good, and in any case must give a proper notice.</p>
			<p id="p10">If the employee is of relatively recent hire, the notice period will be four weeks. The notice period lengthens progressively for those who have been with the employer for longer periods, and can be seven months for a person who has been employed 20 or more years. If an employee resigns, the law requires him to give four weeks notice, up to either the first or 15th of a month.</p>
			<p id="p11">The usual German workweek these days is 38.5 hours, and many employers shut up shop early on Friday afternoons. The law requires 18 working days of vacation annually, but some companies give much more than that, sometimes as much as 30 working days. Unpaid leave is also permitted under certain circumstances.</p>
			<p id="p12">Paid sick leave is six weeks, during which you will continue to receive your full salary. After that time, health insurance pays 70% of your last salary until you either return to work or have to retire because of your health.</p>
			<p id="p13">German law is very generous when it comes to maternity and paternity leave. Mothers are allowed six weeks leave at full pay prior to the child's birth and eight weeks at full pay afterward. In the case of a multiple birth, 12 weeks paid leave is allowed. The mother or father is then allowed up to three years of unpaid leave to stay at home with the child. Recently, the German government initiated a program that allows direct subsidies to new parents ( Elterngeld ).</p>
			<p id="p14">Salaries are generally deposited directly into your bank account around the 25th of each month.</p>
			<p id="p15">Looking for a Job</p>
			<p id="p16">Let's say that you have a critical skill, are a member of the family of a person with a critical skill or come from another European Union country. The chances are you can seek work in Germany. If you are none of the above, you may have problems. ( See the separate article on residence and work permits. )</p>
			<p id="p17">If you want to work in Germany, and think you will be allowed to, there are a number of steps you can take either before or after getting your residence status.</p>
			<p id="p18">For executives and specialists with sought-after skills, probably the best way to start your job search is with an executive search firm (Personalberatung). The service is usually at no cost for those candidates who are searching for a position. Another of the many advantages of turning to an executive search firm is that you don't necessarily have to be in Germany when you begin your search.</p>
			<p id="p19">Another option is checking the help wanted ads in the newspapers, or placing a job wanted ad yourself. Most such ads are found in the Saturday editions of big-city newspapers. The Saturday Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung is particularly rich in this type of advertising.</p>
			<p id="p20">A third option is the Labor Office (Arbeitsamt). It has extensive listings of vacancies, which you can examine without charge even if you have no work permit.</p>
			<p id="p21">And, of course, there are a large number of websites dedicated to finding jobs.</p>
			<p id="p22">Though knowledge of English is often a "plus" in today's German labor market, a reasonable knowledge of German is also often necessary for a supervisory, clerical or sales job.</p>
			<p id="p23">It is sometimes possible for an American with a tourist passport to find a job with the U.S. military forces in Germany, though the prospects aren't terribly bright. Both local nationals and family members of military people have priority over tourists. Check with the Civilian Personnel Office that is located in just about any community with a substantial U.S. military presence. If you find such a job you can take it without having a work permit.</p>

Polar regions include the Arctic in the Northern Hemisphere and Antarctica    in the Southern Hemisphere. The Arctic encompasses a large, mostly frozen    ocean surrounded by land, is home to almost four million people ( ACIA,    2004 ), and includes    some or all of the territories of eight nations, including    the  United States. By contrast, Antarctica is an ice-covered continent   surrounded by ocean and is generally uninhabited.
The Arctic is  expected to experience the greatest rates of warming compared with other world regions ( IPCC, 2007a ). In part, this is because ice has greater reflectivity (also known as albedo) than the ocean or land.  Melting of highly reflective snow and ice reveals darker land and ocean surfaces, increasing absorption of the sun's heat and further warming the planet, especially  in those regions. There is evidence that climate change is already having  observable impacts in the Arctic and in Antarctica. Many of these observed changes are consistent with the expected effects of climate change under a range of climate scenarios.

,      an 8-nation intergovernmental forum including the United States. The      ACIA concluded      the following:
Effects on the Climate System
Average temperatures in the Arctic have risen at almost twice     the rate as temperatures in the rest of the world over the past few decades.
Widespread        melting of glaciers and sea ice and rising permafrost temperatures         present additional evidence of strong Arctic warming (see       Figure 1).
The above trends are expected to continue during this century, resulting         from ongoing increases in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases       (though greenhouse gases do not primarily originate from the Arctic).
Melting of Arctic glaciers is a contributing factor to sea-level              rise around       the world.
Warming is very likely to alter the release and uptake       of greenhouse gases from soils, vegetation, and coastal oceans.
Ocean acidification will  adversely affect marine calcifiers by      making it more difficult for these organisms to form protective shells
Reduction           in sea ice is very likely to have devastating consequences for polar           bears, ice-dependent seals, and local                     people for whom these       animals are a primary food source.
Effects on Biological and Human Systems
Arctic impacts will have implications           for biodiversity around the world because migratory species depend         on breeding and       feeding grounds in the Arctic.
Reduced sea ice is likely to increase         marine access to the region’s                    resources, expanding opportunities for shipping and possibly           for offshore oil extraction (although operations could be hampered           initially by increasing         movement of sea ice in some areas).
As frozen ground thaws,           many existing buildings, roads, pipelines, airports, and industrial         facilities are likely to be destabilized.
Increased           areas of tree growth in the Arctic could serve to take up carbon dioxide           (CO 2 , the principal greenhouse gas emitted           by human                        activities) and supply more wood products and related             employment, providing local and global benefits. However, tree growth             would mean absorption                        of additional sunlight (as the land surface would become       darker and less reflective) and add to regional warming.
Climate change           is taking place within the context of many other ongoing changes in         the Arctic, including observed increases             in chemical contaminants entering the Arctic from other regions,         overfishing, land use changes that result in habitat destruction and             fragmentation, rapid growth in the human population, and cultural,             governance and economic       changes.
The conclusions of the ACIA report are further supported by evidence from    remote sensing technologies. Satellites and U.S. and British Navy submarines    have provided data on retreating Arctic sea ice and decreasing Arctic ice    thickness. Satellite data show that the extent of Arctic sea ice has decreased    by about three percent per decade. Figure 2 below shows trends    in Arctic sea ice extent since the 1860s.

Upward-looking sonar data from  U.S. Navy submarines between 1987 and 1997 show it is very likely that average ice  thickness in the Arctic has decreased by up to 1 meter ( IPCC, 2007a ).
The Intergovernmental Panel on  Climate Change ( IPCC 2007a and 2007b ) supports and extends the ACIA’s  conclusions with additional evidence. The IPCC notes that “the resilience  shown historically by Arctic Indigenous Peoples is now being severely tested,” with  impacts on food availability and personal safety that are changing hunting and  traveling practices. Community infrastructures will be harmed by the warming  and thawing of permafrost. A less severe climate may bring benefits as well, such  as reduced heating costs, new agricultural and forestry opportunities, and more  navigable northern sea routes, but such benefits will depend on local  conditions.
Antarctica
Like the Arctic in the Northern Hemisphere, Antarctica in the Southern Hemisphere    has been experiencing effects attributable to changes in regional climate.    Future changes resulting from global climate change are also expected to be significant    in this region of the world.
Over the past half-century, there has been a marked      warming trend in      the Antarctic Peninsula. Much of the rest of Antarctica has cooled during the last 30 years, due to     ozone depletion and other factors, but  this trend is likely      to reverse. Surface waters of the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica      have    warmed and become less saline, and precipitation in this region has increased   ( IPCC, 2007a ).
Antarctica has experienced significant      retreat and collapse of ice shelves,  the result of regional warming.      The loss of these ice shelves      has few direct impacts on sea level and global climate. Because the ice      shelves were floating, their melting does not directly add to sea level    rise. They      usually are replaced by sea-ice cover, so overall albedo (reflectivity)      changes very little ( IPCC, 2007a ).
Satellite observations show no      significant change in Antarctic sea-ice extent over the 1973-2005 period. Analysis of whaling records and modeling studies provide some evidence for  longer-term declines in sea ice extent in some regions, but there are not  enough data to provide firm conclusions ( IPCC, 2007a ).
As climate      change continues, most of the land-based Antarctic ice sheet      is actually likely to thicken if projected warming increases snowfall.    There is a small risk, however, that the West Antarctic ice sheet will    retreat in coming centuries. This is because the West Antarctic ice sheet    is    moored      in      an oceanic basin, where slippery mud covers the basin floor. This unique      setting makes the ice sheet potentially unstable ( IPCC, 2007a ).

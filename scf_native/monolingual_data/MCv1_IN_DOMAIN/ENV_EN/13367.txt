EPA Greenhouse Gas Reduction Initiatives
EPA plays a significant role in  encouraging voluntary         reductions from large corporations, consumers,       industrial and commercial buildings and many     major industrial sectors .
Clean Energy-Environment State Partnership
The Clean       Energy-Environment State Partnership Program is a voluntary state-federal       partnership that encourages states to develop and implement cost-effective       clean energy and environmental strategies. These strategies help further both environmental       and clean energy goals while achieving public health and economic benefits.       Under the Partnership Program, states work across their relevant agencies       to develop and implement a comprehensive strategy for using existing and       new energy policies and programs to promote energy efficiency, clean distributed       generation, renewable energy and other clean energy sources that can provide     air quality and other benefits.
Climate Leaders
Climate Leaders is an EPA industry-government partnership that works with companies to develop comprehensive climate change strategies. Partner companies commit to reducing their impact on the global environment by setting aggressive greenhouse gas reduction goals. Through program participation, companies create a credible record of their accomplishments and receive EPA recognition as corporate environmental leaders. Climate Leaders Partners range from Fortune 100 corporations to small businesses and represent a variety of industries and sectors, from manufacturers and utilities to financial institutions and retailers, with operations in all 50 states.
Combined Heat and Power (CHP) Partnership
The CHP           Partnership is a voluntary program to reduce the environmental           impact of power generation by promoting the use of CHP. CHP is an efficient,           clean and reliable approach to generating power and thermal energy           from a single fuel source. The Partnership works closely with energy           users, the CHP industry, state and local governments and other stakeholders           to support the development of new projects and promote their energy,         environmental and economic benefits.
ENERGY STAR
In         1992, EPA introduced ENERGY STAR as         a voluntary labeling program designed to identify and promote energy-efficient         products to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. ENERGY STAR has been a joint         EPA-Department of Energy program since 1996. Today more than 1,400 manufacturers         use the ENERGY STAR in over 40 product categories. EPA also offers the         ENERGY STAR partnership to businesses and organizations of all types         and sizes including schools, hospitals, hotels, small businesses and         congregations and to key industries such as auto manufacturing, petroleum         refining and pharmaceuticals. ENERGY STAR delivers the technical information         and tools that organizations and consumers need to choose energy-efficient         solutions and best management practices. ENERGY STAR has successfully         delivered energy and cost savings across the country, saving businesses,         organizations and consumers approximately $10 billion in 2004. ENERGY         STAR also has international         partnerships intended to unify voluntary energy-efficiency labeling         programs in major global markets and make it easier to participate in       the program.
EPA Office of Transportation and Air Quality Voluntary Programs
Transportation and           Air Quality voluntary programs aim to reduce pollution and improve air quality     by means of forming partnerships           with small and large businesses, citizen groups, industry, manufacturers,           trade associations and state and local governments. For example, in           February 2004 EPA announced the SmartWay           Transport Partnership . The           Partnership is a collaborative voluntary program between EPA and the           freight industry that will increase the energy efficiency and energy           security of our country while significantly reducing air pollution           and greenhouse gases. Additional transportation and air quality voluntary           programs at EPA include: the Green Vehicle Guide, Voluntary Diesel           Retrofit Program, Clean School Bus USA, Best Workplaces for Commuters         and It All Adds Up to Cleaner Air.
Green Power Partnership
The Green           Power Partnership is a voluntary partnership between EPA and organizations           that are interested in buying green power. Green power is an environmentally           friendly electricity product that is generated from renewable energy           sources. Through this program, EPA supports organizations that are           buying or planning to buy green power. As a Green Power partner, an           organization pledges to replace a portion of its electricity consumption           with green power within a year of joining the Partnership. EPA offers           credible benchmarks for green power purchases, market information         and opportunities for recognition and promotion of leading purchasers.
High GWP Gas Voluntary Programs
EPA has a set of voluntary industry partnerships that are substantially       reducing U.S. emissions of high       global warming potential (high GWP) gases. These synthetic gases - including       perfluorocarbons (PFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and sulfur hexafluoride       (SF 6 ) - are manufactured for commercial use or    generated as waste byproducts of industrial operations. Some of these gases have valuable uses as substitutes       for ozone depleting substances. However, some species of these gases, while       released in small quantities, are extremely potent greenhouse gases with       very long atmospheric lifetimes. The high       GWP partnership programs involve several industries, including HCFC-22       producers, primary aluminum smelters, semiconductor manufacturers, electric       power companies and magnesium smelters and die-casters. These industries       are reducing greenhouse gas emissions by developing and implementing cost-effective       improvements to their industrial processes. To date, these voluntary programs       have achieved significant emission reductions and industry partners are     expected to maintain emissions below 1990 levels beyond the year 2010.
Methane Voluntary Programs
U.S. industries along with state and local governments collaborate         with EPA to promote profitable         opportunities for reducing emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse         gas. These    voluntary  programs are designed to overcome a wide range of informational,         technical and institutional barriers to reducing methane emissions,         while creating profitable activities for the coal, natural gas, petroleum,         landfill and agricultural industries. The collective results of EPA’s         voluntary methane partnership programs have been substantial. Total U.S. methane emissions in 2003 were more than 10 percent lower than emissions         in 1990, in spite of economic growth over that time period. EPA expects         that these programs will maintain emissions below 1990 levels in the         future due to expanded industry participation and the continuing commitment         of the participating companies to identify and implement cost-effective         technologies and practices. Additionally, through our participation in         the Methane to Markets Partnership ,       the U.S. is also working towards reducing international methane emissions.
WasteWise
WasteWise is         a voluntary EPA program through which organizations eliminate costly         municipal solid waste and select industrial wastes, benefiting their         bottom line and reducing the amount of waste deposited in landfills.   WasteWise is a flexible program that allows partners to         design their own waste reduction programs tailored to their needs. Waste         reduction can save organizations money through reduced purchasing and         waste disposal costs. WasteWise provides free technical assistance to         help organizations develop, implement and measure their waste reduction       activities.
Other Federal Greenhouse Gas Reduction     Initiatives
Numerous Federal agencies have launched initiatives to reduce greenhouse         gas emissions intensity. These initiatives address market barriers, accelerate         the adoption of proven technologies and practices and deliver substantial         emissions reductions. The list that follows highlights some of these       initiatives:
In February 2010, President Obama announced a Presidential Memorandum creating an Interagency Task Force on Carbon Capture and Storage to develop a comprehensive and coordinated federal strategy to speed the development and deployment of clean coal technologies. The Task Force will develop a proposed plan to overcome the barriers to the widespread, cost-effective deployment of CCS within 10 years, with a goal of bringing 5 to 10 commercial demonstration projects online by 2016. The Co-Chairs of the Task Force include senior officials from the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Other federal agencies involved include the USDA, Commerce, Interior, Labor, State, Transportation and Treasury, as well as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
Climate VISION Partnership
In February 2003, several major industrial         sectors and the membership of the Business Roundtable committed         to work with four  U.S. agencies (the Department of Energy, EPA, Department of Transportation and         Department of Agriculture) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the next decade. Participating         industry sectors include oil and gas production, transportation and         refining; electricity generation; coal and mineral production and mining;         manufacturing (automobiles, cement, iron and steel, magnesium, aluminum,         chemicals and semiconductors); railroads; and forestry products. For         more information, please visit the Climate       Vision Homepage .
Targeted Incentives for Agricultural Greenhouse Gas Sequestration
In June 2003, the Secretary of Agriculture announced that the Department       of Agriculture (USDA) will provide targeted incentives to encourage wider       use of land management practices that remove carbon from the atmosphere       or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Through forest and agriculture       conservation programs, such as the Environmental Quality Incentives Program       and Conservation Reserve Program, USDA is encouraging the increased use       of biomass energy, crop and grazing land conservation actions, practices       to reduce emissions from agriculture and sustainable forest management.       For more information, please visit the USDA     Press Release on Targeted Incentives for Greenhouse Gas Sequestration .
Tax Incentives to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions
The factsheet Energy Provisions of the American Recovery  and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA or Recovery Act) provides information on the tax incentives for both  individuals and businesses.  The  incentives are designed to spur the use of cleaner, renewable energy and more  energy-efficient technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  The tax incentives include:  an increase in the energy tax credit for  homeowners who make energy efficient improvements to their existing homes;  credits to purchase for qualified residential alternative energy equipment,  such as solar hot water heaters, geothermal heat pumps and wind turbines; and  plug-in electric drive vehicles.  The new  law also includes increases to new clean renewable energy bonds and qualified  energy conservation bonds.  These are  just a few of the energy provisions listed.   The EPA web site contains more information on the Recovery Act , especially Clean  Diesel .
In February 2002, the President  directed the Department of Energy, together with other involved Federal  agencies, to recommend reforms to enhance the Voluntary Reporting Program . Following extensive public review,  the Program’s guidelines underwent an extensive overhaul with the focus of  reporting shifting away from individual projects to emphasize entity-wide  emissions inventories and emission reductions. For more information on  revisions to the Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Program, visit the Changes to Revised Form EIA-1605 page. The  revised 1605(b) Program will begin collecting reports under the revised  guidelines for the 2006, 2007 and 2008 reporting years in 2009.

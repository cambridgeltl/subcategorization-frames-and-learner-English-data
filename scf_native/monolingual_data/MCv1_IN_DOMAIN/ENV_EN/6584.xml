			<p id="p2">World Temperatures according to the Hadley Center for Climate Prediction. Note the steep drop over the last year.</p>
			<p id="p3">Twelve-month long drop in world temperatures wipes out a century of warming</p>
			<p id="p4">Over the past year, anecdotal evidence for a cooling planet has exploded. China has its coldest winter in 100 years. Baghdad sees its first snow in all recorded history. North America has the most snowcover in 50 years , with places like Wisconsin the highest since record-keeping began. Record levels of Antarctic sea ice, record cold in Minnesota , Texas, Florida, Mexico, Australia , Iran, Greece , South Africa, Greenland, Argentina, Chile -- the list goes on and on.</p>
			<p id="p5">No more than anecdotal evidence, to be sure. But now, that evidence has been supplanted by hard scientific fact. All four major global temperature tracking outlets (Hadley, NASA's GISS, UAH, RSS) have released updated data. All show that over the past year, global temperatures have dropped precipitously.</p>
			<p id="p6">A compiled list of all the sources can be seen here . The total amount of cooling ranges from 0.65C up to 0.75C -- a value large enough to wipe out most of the warming recorded over the past 100 years. All in one year's time. For all four sources, it's the single fastest temperature change ever recorded, either up or down.</p>
			<p id="p7">Scientists quoted in a past DailyTech article link the cooling to reduced solar activity which they claim is a much larger driver of climate change than man-made greenhouse gases. The dramatic cooling seen in just 12 months time seems to bear that out. While the data doesn't itself disprove that carbon dioxide is acting to warm the planet, it does demonstrate clearly that more powerful factors are now cooling it.</p>
			<p id="p8">Let's hope those factors stop fast. Cold is more damaging than heat. The mean temperature of the planet is about 54 degrees. Humans -- and most of the crops and animals we depend on -- prefer a temperature closer to 70.</p>
			<p id="p9">Historically, the warm periods such as the Medieval Climate Optimum were beneficial for civilization. Corresponding cooling events such as the Little Ice Age, though, were uniformly bad news.</p>
			<p id="p10">Update 2/27: The graph for HadCRUT (above), as well as the linked graphs for RSS and UAH are generated month-to-month; the temperature declines span a full 12 months of data. The linked GISS graph was graphed for the months of January only, due to a limitation in the plotting program. Anthony Watts, who kindly provided the graphics, otherwise has no connection with the column. The views and comments are those of the author only.</p>

			<p id="p14">Climate fluctuates. The world isn't going to follow our preconceived ideas even if a panel of scientists says it should. But that's what we call leaning; if we knew everything we'd have nothing to learn, and when it comes to climate we obviously have a lot. Things like this are very interesting to read and learn about, it just isn't a surprise, especially involving climate where one would expect there to be a lot of fluctuations.</p>
			<p id="p15">I guess we'll find out in another year more of what's going on (what the trend is, or if this is just a blip so to speak), but this has definitely been one heck of a winter.</p>

			<p id="p18">That's exactly what this is. A climate fluctuation.</p>
			<p id="p19">Notice in the graph, even with the fluctuating drop in temperature in the USA, it is still .037 degrees above normal...</p>
			<p id="p20">Even more interesting, these cold temperatures are probably caused the a La Nina event.</p>

			<p id="p25">What do you mean, 'you people'? You're turning this into an ad hominem attack. I'm just a dad, husband and citizen who's trying to show some responsibility in a world of excess. I can't believe there are still naysayers out there who are willing to interpret this evidence as an indication of possible global cooling. You're an armchair scientist taking potshots at years of hard work. True, we are dealing with a complex global system here, but to deny that pumping billions of tons of small particles into the air may not lead to global warming is insane. The earth is not cooling; the overall trend is a warming one, and it is directly linked to human activity over the past 150 or so years (Industrial Revolution). True, it has always changed, but it's the rate of change that is troubling. The earth's circulatory system has been dramatically altered. It follows that there will be inevitable adjustments to climate, to include cooling spells (see 'Duh' post). It seems that some of you are living in a fantasy, ready to cling to the nearest theoretical life raft so you won't have to change your lifestyles. For crying out loud, people, take a look at the poles! Don't use this as an excuse to be complacent, take some responsibility.</p>

			<p id="p32">Agreed, I find the whole global warming thing really disturbing. Its like the Akira cult (from Akira). Its like the scientists are competing with the religious nuts to convince us that "Armageddon is coming soon". The most disturbing thing is that Governments are being coerced by a mouthy minority lobby to act and legislate against a phantom problem and their is a real anti-progress, anti-west, anti consumerism and anti-technology flavour to it all. I would almost say that the mod's reaction is against how far we have come from more simple times and the extent to which technology has entered our lives and the puritan feeling that excess in all its forms is somehow 'wrong'?.</p>
			<p id="p33">Global warming might well be completely unrelated to environmental pollution and to the fact that Oil and Gas (and eventually coal) are likely to run out, both utter tragedies whcih are 100% genuine. Don't get me wrong, I feel that pollution is absolutely wrong and we need to completely reduce the amount of items we send to land-fill and recycling them where possible makes sense. We need to urgently find replacement fuels to replace oil.</p>
			<p id="p34">This does not imply that Global Warming is related to any of the above. I feel that the net effect of the overstated Global Warming craze is just one where Governments and companies tax you either directly or indirectly more on anything they can. Its already happening in the UK. To believe that they are motivated by concern for the environment is gullible at best and kidding yourselves. They do it for votes, and they do it to extract more money and control out of the populace. The human condition dictates that we must be having an effect on the planet (in our minds) After all we are more than 6 billion humans in the world, and that number seems awfully big, doesn't it? The whole CO2/warming correlation I have always considered tenuous at best and the whole idea seems entirely self-important and too far fetched to be believable...</p>
			<p id="p35">The worst case scenario is that the earth gets too hot/cold to support human life, humanity dies out and then it returns to balance eventually in a couple of thousand years. Problem solved.</p>

			<p id="p39">Dad, don't take "you people" so personally. Check the Constitution- there was no "right to not be offended". I know the school conditioned you to be offended at every little thing that 'feels' uncomfortable. I just purchased a chill pill offset in your name. And new evidence shows 'again' that it's ok to let your kid play contact sports, without getting a trophy, cause everyone DOESN'T win. Did you ever notice it's mostly the kids who were brought up in the timeout era who came up with all of this bunk? Now acting up in school is a 'mental disease'... what has come of this world? Keep drinking the fluoride water. Yes, even 1ppm was bad for us and it didn't help our teeth. Tell me, are you a member of K.O.O.K.S ( K eep O ur O wn K ids S afe)?</p>
			<p id="p40">Showing some 'responsibility' is teaching your kids not to dive in head first when Mr. Al Gore claims to have thousands of scientists (many of whom flat-out deny endorsing the 'theory'), and is proven grossly wrong on the major claims of his global warming (oops, they changed it cause that wasn't popular- "Climate Change" now) theory in a liberal country, in a liberal court. Responsibility is teaching kids to practice what you preach- not "Al Gore's do as I say not as I do" while I spread the word on Global...sorry- Climate Change. Responsibility is to teach them what a joke "carbon offsets" or credits are. Responsibility is to show them what a crock it was to 'fill in the blank' on the chart when the Global Warming data didn't fit the model. So, I'm not sure what you mean by us people "ignoring' the evidence". Us people did not ignore the evidence- evidence that we did not have to "doctor". " but to deny that pumping billions of tons of small particles into the air may not lead to global warming is insane"? I don't deny that it may not lead - I go one further and say the evidence says it is NOT leading to that. But, once the GW crowd gets stuck in a loop, they just don't let go, even when the evidence is countered- scientifically. I don't blame you too much though, the education system has gone so liberal and if it feels good (save the earth- the new religion) do it. It's not your fault. And, of course, all of the new industry that was put on the fast track to come up around the bogus theory, well, if we changed now, jobs would be lost and we just can't do that. GW/CC is just a big money grab.</p>
			<p id="p41">What science would YOU have to see to get you off this global warming bandwagon? Is the fact that those who came before you WROTE IT DOWN- including the ice age hoax of the 70's and now, the GW/CC crisis? How much more plain can it get besides a picture right in front of your face?</p>

			<p id="p49">You say we are "pumping billions of tons of small particles into the air" -- I think you are confused. Particles in the atmosphere (e.g., soot) cause cooling. The air has gotten cleaner, and this has contributed to warming. CO2 is a gas, and pumping billions of tons of it into the atmosphere probably causes some warming. By how much, who really knows. The point of the article is that while we are worrying about global warming, an ice age could come along and freeze our butts off. It seems we have a society of worriers. When I was growing up, we worried about global cooling. Then there was Ebola, the bird flu, nuclear melt downs, and pesticides. Look, on average, we are living longer, which says to me that the net effect of all human actions is good, not bad.</p>

			<p id="p53">no no i think you are the one confused. C02 even though its called a gas is still made up of "billions of tons of small particles" despite you not being able to see it it is made of particles with a mass and weight. Soot is the incomplete combustion of carbon to gas. the theory of global warming is that the gas particles are getting trapped in the atmosphere causing a green house effect.</p>

			<p id="p60">The moral of the story is that people are gullible and will believe all kinds of things rather than check facts and use common sense. When I was in school the scientists and the media were pushing the global cooling story and jumping up and down trying to get the governments to 'do something.' A few years later they were arguing for global warming driven by CO2 even though the science clearly showed that the earth had been warmer during the MWP and Roman Warming and common sense would expect that after a period that we called the Little Ice Age one would expect temperatures to go up.</p>

			<p id="p67">You seem well intentioned but you've been utterly misled:</p>
			<p id="p68">1. Even the pro-AGW researchers concede that the sun played a dominant role in GW until the mid-to-late 20th century.</p>
			<p id="p69">2. The IPCC cites CO2 as causing 40-45 PERCENT of AGW in the past century. According to them it's been the biggest component, but not the majority component.</p>
			<p id="p70">3. By the "poles" I assume you mean the Arctic. Most of the Arctic melt-off of the past 150 years has been due to dirty snow caused by soot coupled with increased solar activity (see above). Same goes for Kilimanjaro in the tropics with the added factor of loss of recharge precipitation due to deforestation lossage of arboreal microclimates. Westerly-borne (Asian) soot has been causing more than half of the ice pack lossage in the American Rockies as well. The rest is due largely to local soot &amp; land use changes (deforestation) that have altered recharge precipitation patterns.</p>
			<p id="p71">4. Likewise SOOT has been discovered to cause more warming than surface dimming (cooling). SO much so that it's found to be accountable for up to HALF of what's been blamed on CO2. Time to revise some computer models, eh? Note how the rhetoric has shifted from "CO2" to "greenhouse gases."</p>
			<p id="p72">Look, I think you are trying to do the responsible thing but what politicos around the world have latched onto is a way to conscript your conscience by calling you into a noble endeavor. But how noble is that endeavor, actually?</p>
			<p id="p73">Let's look @ Kyoto. As it is structured Kyoto TAXES Western countries for their CO2 use, exempts developing countries (importantly China &amp; India) from those same taxes &amp; PAYS them instead (again CHina &amp; India) to eliminate CO2 sources &amp; develop low-CO2 energy sources. If you believe in AGW looks good on paper.</p>
			<p id="p74">In practice this is how it's being found to work:</p>
			<p id="p75">1. Western factory jobs are already being off-shored to China, India, elsewhere in Asia.</p>
			<p id="p76">2. The Kyoto CO2 "taxes" further encourage the loss of domestic production by increasing the incentive to offshore production. Bad for labor? You bet. But somehow in pro-labor Europe this hasn't become a big issue quite yet, but it's starting to simmer.</p>
			<p id="p77">3. The whole point of Kyoto is overall lower CO2 emissions. Although China emits 1/3rd the per capita CO2 of say, the USA, China's emissions per unit of production are 40 PERCENT HIGHER than the WORLD AVERAGE (and even higher than the West's avg). China's soot output (only recently discovered to cause more net atmospheric warming than surface cooling, up to HALF of what had heretofore blamed on CO2) is the highest per capita in the world.</p>
			<p id="p78">So do you see what this means? It means that the rank &amp; file environmentalist bloc has been snookered into both offshoring &amp; destroying domestic production &amp; jobs AND increasing CO2 emissions!!</p>
			<p id="p79">Noble endeavor? Kyoto's about ready to be exposed as a big lie, as big as the Children's Crusade.</p>
			<p id="p80">And when the rank &amp; file pro-environment people figure out how they've been led by the nose by Al Gore the same way the wicked witch of PETA leads her cult of fools, all around the world Gore be hung in effigy by his former followers, the labor bloc will register their votes from the rooftops.</p>

			<p id="p93">" True, it has always changed, but it's the rate of change that is troubling." The signal is not stationary how can one define the rate of change.</p>

			<p id="p95">"It follows that there will be inevitable adjustments to climate, to include cooling spells (see 'Duh' post)." Adjustments? From what "forcing"?</p>

In the early 70s scientists were saying global cooling and as a kid I distincly remember making a snowman in Pasadena Texas where it never snows. The short and long of it is, looking historically, you'll find that scientists take a pinch of data, paint a big picture and hold their hands out for more grants and funds to continue research. If you really dig you'll find that repeatedly. Let me ask this though, how often does your local weatherman actually make an accurate prediction on the weather? Based on whatever answer you give for that, then try and ask that same question about these experts trumpeting the global warming trend.</p>

One year, is not enough to make a trend, and as a greenhouse, CO2 must have some sort of warming affect (though exact figures differ too much to be exactly sure how much). However, if past trends in solar cycles have *note the 'IF' because further research must occur before any exact conclusions can be made* a coorelation with weather along with the La Niña and El Niño events then to say that they only offset what heating the CO2 levels now will cause seems like you mean that CO2 outweighs these others, but that has not been conclusively evaluated with actual scientific research for all those fields.</p>

			<p id="p150">That's right, as a whole, the planet's surface is less than one degree above freezing. I'm not a climatologist, but I suspect that when it drops much below zero, glaciers tend to spread out from the poles, and when it's much above zero, they tend to recede.</p>

It coincides with the start of an upward trend in temperature that eventually triggered the end of the Little Ice Age. C.) Temperature in 2004-2005 only just exceeded the highest temperature at its highest just prior to the Little Ice Age. D.) That 1000 year high has already decreased over the last 2 years and if January and February are any signs that we will see at least as significant of a drop in 08 as the increase in 04. E.)That due to increased car usage in China the most that best case in CO2 generated by cars is level with the 04 numbers but most likely has increased.</p>
			<p id="p215">I am really fearful of this quick fix philosophy that we as a world, and most definitely the US environmentalist groups in the US have. The world has always seemed to be able to deal with gradual changes better then we think whether is through changing the coverage area and density of the Ozone or increased or decreased plant life. It seems to me the earth is has always been a pendulum, always a second late on its changes but finding balance in chaos. Our quick fix attitude seems to me that again we find ourselves more important then we are (like we could actually cause the planet to self destruct)when actually us changing to rapidly to fix one problem could cause the world the pendulum to swing faster till everything spirals out of control.</p>
			<p id="p216">In the end taking the average of a constantly rising temperature of a world coming off an Ice Age isn't exactly the best way to judge what the perfect temperature is.

Data that has been recorded for at least 60 years real time. Now, 20 years of data doesn't trump 60. Also, why was that chart even made? Where's the context and what were they studying? If they were studying temperature fluctuations, how do you know that it had anything to do with global warming. You're comparing a specific observation with a theory. The comparison isn't valid. And the range of values until the last spike down that your whole rant is about is not even significant in regards to the totality of the data. If anything it does more to prove warming. If the earth is indeed warming, then, at some point, equilibrium would say that the rebound will be ever more pronounced.</p>

That year started out, in Stanley as well as other regions of the south, so mild for the months of January and February that many folks let their fires go out and burned wood only for cooking; however, March was very cold and windy. Showers started the Month of April but ended with snow and ice. In May the temperature was like that of winter. The young buds that began forming in April were stiff and frozen. Ice, one half inch thick formed on ponds and rivers in North and South Carolina. Corn was killed and after being planted again and again nothing was reaped from the cornfields. June was cold, the coldest month ever experienced in this latitude. Almost all green things as well as fruits were killed. There was ice, frost, and some snow flurries in July. August proved to be the worst month of all not only here but even in Europe. September started out with two weeks of pleasant weather and the rest of the month was cold. October and November were extremely cold and then December was mild. This extraordinary weather condition in 1816 had been caused by the volcanic eruption of Mt. Temboro in the Dutch East Indies, blowing 50 cubic miles of dust into the air and killing some 66,000 people. The volcanic dust clouded the skies all over the earth causing doom and gloom and the "year without a summer."</p>

However, heat can't be destroyed -- a shutdown of circulation means some other region must warm even more to compensate. Greenhouse gases therefore can't cause cooling on a global scale. The heat has to go *somewhere*.</p>

			<p id="p331">You're right, the heat is not destroyed. And it does go somewhere, indeed. But you seem to think that the system is frozen (sic!), and think in terms of all other things being equal. But the heat is constantly added and removed to/from the system, and the net balance depends on the state of the system. If you assume one second that a major disruption occurs to the current redistributing the heat, leading to a regional cooling of large part of high and mid-latitudes (that would globally be overcome by a larger warming trend in low latitudes in the first phase, as you rightly point out), and that this cooling is enough to cover large regions with snow &amp; ice after a while, then you have changed your forcings, more energy is reflected to space, and you may have triggered a feedback that will for a while or the long run compensate or invert the effect of increased GHG.</p>
			<p id="p332">Now I am not saying that this is necessarily a credible scenario, and you pointed out this alternative has been dismissed as very unlikely (and the TH circulation impact would probably not change the global outcome). It is just illustrative of the fact that the direct effect of CO2 is far from being enough to understand the warming, and that feedbacks from the system are the most important and complex part of the climate response to understand.</p>
			<p id="p333">But the bottom line is that feedbacks as they are known now would not explain a long term global cooling.</p>

			<p id="p344">Not quite. Changes in radiance of the sun does not explain the changes in temps. Take a look at the work of Dr. Svensmark, Danish Climate Scientist. A good book on his theory is "The Chilling Stars".</p>
			<p id="p345">The driver is the increased cloud cover caused by more GCR (Galactic Cosmic Rays) allowed into earth's atmosphere by low magnetic activity in the sun. The sun's magnetic activity can shield earth from GCRs. GCRs provide the 'specks' needed to start cloud formation, more GCRs, more clouds, less CGRs, fewer clouds. Estimates are that a change of 2-4% in global cloud cover can foster a 1-3 deg F change in temp. The suns magnetic activity can be tracked by observing the number of sunspots, more sunspots, higher magnetic activity. Prior to 2006 the sun has been VERY active magnetically. Since 2006 (the end of Solar Cycle 23) there have been virtually no sunspots and Solar Cycle 24 is a year overdue. The result is more clouds, lower temps.</p>

			<p id="p364">by S. Fred Singer</p>
			<p id="p365">"Meltdown" goes into far more scientific detail than it's title would suggest. It does a great job of presenting the science and the data juxtaposed to how it's actually reported in the press. What it really showed me how to do is to look at these GW stories with a much more critical eye, to look not only at what is being said or shown, but also at how it's presented and what ought to be shown or said but isn't.</p>
			<p id="p366">For example, why is it that a NY Times story about increasing temperatures in the 20th century includes a graph that only shows temperatures since 1978? Is it because from the 1940's to the 1970's temperatures were actually going down, and so if you start your graph at a known low point then obviously everything after that looks like a more dramatic increase?</p>
			<p id="p367">And remember those famous graphs from Al Gore's movie showing the high degree of correlation between temperature and CO2 over the past 600,000 years? Ever wonder why he only showed them as two separate graphs so that you had to "eyeball" the correlation? Why didn't he simply superimpose one onto the other so that the relationship would be obvious? Because if he did you'd see that the relationship is the opposite of what he claims, that temperature is actually leading CO2, not the other way around.</p>
			<p id="p368">What I really liked about "Unstoppable Global Warming" is that every chapter ends with *several* pages of citations so you don't have to take the author's word for anything, you can look up everything on your own. Compare that with the GW Alarmists who want you to accept everything they say at face value, and who also insist that the debate is over and the science is settled. Who sounds more credible, the guy who encourages you to check his work, or the guy who wants to you accept what he has to say and discourages any questions or debate?</p>

The eccentricity, axial tilt, and precession of the Earth's orbit vary in several patterns, resulting in 100,000 year ice age cycles of the Quaternary glaciation over the last few million years. The Earth's axis completes one full cycle of precession approximately every 26,000 years. At the same time, the elliptical orbit rotates, more slowly, leading to a 21,000 year cycle between the seasons and the orbit. In addition, the angle between Earth's rotational axis and the normal to the plane of its orbit changes from 21.5 degrees to 24.5 degrees and back again on a 41,000 year cycle. Currently, this angle is 23.44 degrees and is decreasing.</p>
			<p id="p428">The Milankovitch theory of climate change is not perfectly worked out; in particular, the largest observed response is at the 100,000 year timescale, but the forcing is apparently small at this scale, in regard to the ice ages. Various feedbacks (from carbon dioxide, or from ice sheet dynamics) are invoked to explain this discrepancy.</p>
			<p id="p429">Milankovitch-like theories were advanced by Joseph Adhemar, James Croll, Milutin Milankovic and others, but verification was difficult due to the absence of reliably dated evidence and doubts as to exactly which periods were important. Not until the advent of deep-ocean cores and the seminal paper by Hays, Imbrie and Shackleton "Variations in the earths orbit: pacemaker of the ice ages" in Science, 1976, did the theory attain its present state.</p>

			<p id="p435">True. And as you no doubt know, many scientists (including some Christians who are scientists) have labeled the "young-earth-creationists" (YECs) and the "ID-Movement" leadership as "liars for Jesus".</p>
			<p id="p436">That's like the pot calling the kettle black:</p>
			<p id="p437">The “Reverend” Sir John Houghton , former head of the UK Meteorological Office, Publisher of Al Gore’s book on GW and Former Co-Chair of the IPCC , said this:</p>
			<p id="p438">“Unless we announce disasters, no one will listen”</p>
			<p id="p439">“.. human induced global warming is a weapon of mass destruction at least as dangerous as chemical, nuclear or biological weapons that kills more people than terrorism.” ~ John Houghton Monday July 28, 2003</p>
			<p id="p440">Some would call that "lying for Jesus", too -- with malice aforethought. No Kidding. (See "Court case" in my next post)</p>
			<p id="p441">*</p>
			<p id="p442">“.. Mr. Cizik said he had a “conversion” on climate change so profound in Oxford that he likened it to an “altar call,” when nonbelievers accept Jesus as their savior. Mr. Cizik recently bought a Toyota Prius, a hybrid vehicle. “ Richard Cizik is the Vice president of governmental affairs for the National Association of Evangelicals</p>
			<p id="p443">Oct. 2006:</p>
			<p id="p444">“..Cizik dates his “conversion” to 2002, when evangelical left activist Jim Ball of the “What Would Jesus Drive” anti-SUV campaign “dragged” him to Oxford, England, for a global warming summit featuring scientist and Christian thinker John Houghton. “I had, as John Wesley would say, a ‘warming of my heart,’ Cizik recalls. “A conversion to a cause which I believe every Christian should be committed to.”</p>
			<p id="p445">After his Oxford conversion, Cizik returned home, sold his gas guzzler, bought a Prius, and renewed his interest in recycling. He notes that evangelicals comprise 40-50 percent of the “Republican base” and Republican politicians, who “have stymied action on climate change, will “have to listen” if evangelicals become as passionate as Cizik is about climate change.</p>
			<p id="p446">Promoters of The Great Warming are hoping that other evangelicals will have dramatic conversions to the global warming cause like Cizik. No doubt, many of these new enthusiasts for the planet are full of passionate sincerity. But some seem to see acceptance of disastrous scenarios of global warming, fueled exclusively by human activity, as almost an article of faith, transcending need for logical argument. For them, it has become intrinsically a struggle between noble friends of the earth and wicked allies of the fossil fuels industry. They have adopted climate activism as a new crusade.</p>
			<p id="p447">Evangelicals are more famous, or notorious, for preaching about the impending End Times. At least that old kind of preaching pointed listeners towards repentance...and God. This new mode of climate revivalism points evangelicals towards a very differently kind of imagined apocalypse, in which the solution is not divine intervention but increased government regulation, reduced standards of living, diminished national sovereignty, and enhanced powers for international bureaucracies. That Old Time Religion now looks more appealing, because it involves God.</p>

He has brought an application to declare unlawful a decision by the then Secretary of State for Education and Skills to distribute to every state secondary school in the United Kingdom a copy of former US Vice-President Al Gore's film, An Inconvenient Truth ("AIT"), ..... I have had very considerable assistance from both the very able Counsel, Paul Downes for the Claimant and Martin Chamberlain for the Defendant, and their respective teams.</p>
			<p id="p461">The context and nub of the dispute are the statutory provisions described in their side headings as respectively relating to "political indoctrination" and to the "duty to secure balanced treatment of political issues" in schools, now contained in ss406 and 407 of the Education Act 1996, which derive from the identical provisions in ss44 and 45 of the Education (No 2) Act 1986. ...</p>
			<p id="p462">I viewed the film at the parties' request..... It is now common ground that it is not simply a science film – ... – but that it is a political film.. . Its theme is not merely the fact that there is global warming,... but that urgent, and if necessary expensive and inconvenient, steps must be taken to counter it, many of which are spelt out.</p>
			<p id="p463">Paul Downes... has established his case that the views in the film are political by submitting that Mr Gore promotes an apocalyptic vision, which would be used to influence a vast array of political policies, which he illustrates ...:</p>
			<p id="p464">(i) Fiscal policy and the way that a whole variety of activities are taxed, including fuel consumption, travel and manufacturing …</p>
			<p id="p465">(ii) Investment policy and the way that governments encourage directly and indirectly various forms of activity.</p>
			<p id="p466">(iii) Energy policy and the fuels (in particular nuclear) employed for the future.</p>
			<p id="p467">(iv) Foreign policy and the relationship held with nations that consume and/or produce carbon-based fuels."</p>
			<p id="p468">... the Defendant, does not challenge that the film promotes political views. ................."</p>
			<p id="p469">In the DEFRA [the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] leaflet ... there was this one sentence summary:</p>
			<p id="p470">"Mr Johnson said that influencing the opinions of children was crucial to developing a long term view on the environment among the public."</p>
			<p id="p471">After the pre-action correspondence from the Claimant, and on the very day the Judicial Review Claim Form was issued, a somewhat differently worded news release was issued by the Defendant dated 2 May 2007:</p>
			<p id="p472">"....This pack will help to give young people information and inspiration to understand and debate the issues around climate change..."</p>
			<p id="p473">The explanation for the distribution to all schools is now given in these proceedings in the witness statement of Ms Julie Bramman of the DES:</p>
			<p id="p474">"8. …I should say at once that it was recognised from the start that __parts of the Film contained views about public policy__ and __how we should respond__ to climate change. The aim of distributing the film was not to promote those views, but rather to present the science of climate change in an engaging way and to promote and encourage debate on the political issues raised by that science."</p>

			<p id="p477">Partisan</p>
			<p id="p478">... Mr Downes pointed to dictionary definitions suggesting the relevance of commitment, or adherence to a cause. In my judgment, the best simile for it might be "one sided". Mr Downes , in paragraph 27 of his skeleton argument, helpfully suggested that there were factors that could be considered by a court in determining whether the expression or promotion of a particular view could evidence or indicate partisan promotion of those views:</p>
			<p id="p479">"(i) A superficial treatment of the subject matter typified by portraying factual or philosophical premises as being self-evident or trite with insufficient explanation or justification and without any indication that they may be the subject of legitimate controversy; the misleading use of scientific data; misrepresentations and half-truths; and one-sidedness.</p>
			<p id="p480">(ii) The deployment of material in such a way as to prevent pupils meaningfully testing the veracity of the material and forming an independent understanding as to how reliable it is.</p>
			<p id="p481">(iii) The exaltation of protagonists and their motives coupled with the demonisation of opponents and their motives.</p>
			<p id="p482">(iv) The derivation of a moral expedient from assumed consequences requiring the viewer to adopt a particular view and course of action in order to do "right" as opposed to "wrong."</p>
			<p id="p483">This is clearly a useful analysis.</p>
			<p id="p484">".... What is forbidden by the statute is, as the side heading makes clear, "political indoctrination" . If a teacher uses the platform of a classroom to promote partisan political views in the teaching of any subject, then that would offend against the statute.</p>

			<p id="p486">I turn to AIT, the film. The following is clear:</p>

			<p id="p491">... it is noteworthy that in the (unamended) Guidance Note there is no or no adequate discussion at all, either by way of description or by way of raising relevant questions for discussion, in relation to any of the above 9 'errors', the first two of which are at any rate apparently based on non-existent or misunderstood evidence, and the balance of which are or may be based upon lack of knowledge or appreciation of the scientific position, and all of which are significant planks in Mr Gores's 'political' argumentation. ..."</p>
			<p id="p492">"...One particular change in the section on "Citizenship: Planning a whole day event on climate change" is of some significance:</p>
			<p id="p493">"..... Invite in a guest speaker to go over the issues raised across the day and discuss solutions … But please remember that teaching staff must not promote any particular political response to climate change and, when such potential responses are brought to the attention of pupils, must try to ensure that pupils are offered a balanced presentation of opposing views."</p>
			<p id="p494">The _amended_ Guidance Note contains in its introduction a new and significant passage:</p>
			<p id="p495">"[Schools] must bear in mind the following points</p>
			<p id="p496">* An Inconvenient Truth promotes partisan political views (that is to say, one sided views about political issues)</p>
			<p id="p497">* teaching staff must be careful to ensure that they do not themselves promote those views;</p>
			<p id="p498">* in order to make sure of that, they should take care to help pupils examine the scientific evidence critically (rather than simply accepting what is said at face value) and to point out where Gore's view may be inaccurate ...</p>
			<p id="p499">* where the film suggests that views should take particular action at the political level (e.g. to lobby their democratic representatives to vote for measures to cut carbon emissions), teaching staff must be careful to offer pupils a balanced presentation of opposing views and not to promote either the view expressed in the film or any other particular view.</p>
			<p id="p500">"...I am satisfied that, with the Guidance Note, as amended, the Defendant is setting the film into a context in which it can be shown by teachers, and not so that the Defendant itself or the schools are promoting partisan views contained in the film , and is putting it into a context in which a balanced presentation of opposing views can and will be offered. There is no call for the Defendant to support the more extreme views of Mr Gore – ..."</p>

			<p id="p505">Here's a NASA graph depicting solar activity over the past 400 years. Note the high levels of sunspot activity over the past 60 years. Also note the almost non-existent levels of solar activity between about 1650 and 1710. This period is known as the "Little Ice Age":</p>
			<p id="p506">Yearly Averaged Sunspot Numbers for past 400 years:</p>
			<p id="p507">From BBC News - 2004:</p>
			<p id="p508">A new analysis shows that the Sun is more active now than it has been at anytime in the previous 1,000 years.</p>
			<p id="p509">Scientists based at the Institute for Astronomy in Zurich used ice cores from Greenland to construct a picture of our star's activity in the past. They say that over the last century the number of sunspots rose at the same time that the Earth's climate became steadily warmer.</p>
			<p id="p510">Q-Does the number of sunspots have any effect on the climate here on Earth?</p>
			<p id="p511">A-Sunspots are slightly cooler areas on the surface of the Sun, due to the intense magnetic fields, so they radiate a little less energy than the surroundings. However, there are usually nearby areas associated with the sunspots that are a little hotter (called falculae), and they more than compensate. The result is that there is a little bit more radiation coming from the Sun when it has more sunspots, but the effect is so small that it has very little impact on the weather and climate on Earth.</p>
			<p id="p512">However, there are more important indirect effects: sunspots are associated with what we call "active regions", with large magnetic structures containing very hot material (being held in place by the magnetism). This causes more ultraviolet (or UV) radiation (the rays that give you a suntan or sunburn), and extreme ultraviolet radiation (EUV). These types of radiation have an impact on the chemistry of the upper atmosphere (e.g. producing ozone). Since some of these products act as greenhouse gases, the number of sunspots (through association with active regions) may influence the climate in this way.</p>
			<p id="p513">Many active regions produce giant outflows of material that are called Coronal Mass Ejections.</p>
			<p id="p514">These ejections drag with them some of the more intense magnetic fields that are found in the active regions. The magnetic fields act as a shield for high-energy particles coming from various sources in our galaxy (outside the solar system). These "cosmic rays" (CRs) cause ionization of molecules in the atmosphere, and thereby can cause clouds to form (because the ionized molecules or dust particle can act as "seeds" for drop formation).</p>
			<p id="p515">If clouds are formed very high in the atmosphere, the net result is a heating of the Earth - it acts as a "blanket" that keeps warmth in.</p>
			<p id="p516">If clouds are formed lower down in the atmosphere, they reflect sunlight better than they keep heat inside, so the net result is cooling.</p>
			<p id="p517">Which processes are dominant is still a matter of research.</p>
			<p id="p518">[note: the idea is that increased solar activity keeps away galactic cosmic rays from Earth's atmosphere. GCRs are believed to contribute to the formation of low-level cumulus clouds. These thick low-lying cumulus clouds BLOCK sunlight and act to COOL the planet. So when solar activity is highest, LESS GCRs get through to form the sunlight-blocking clouds, more direct sunlight reaches the Earth's surface AND the planet warms...naturally.-LC]</p>

			<p id="p523">AGW is a complete HOAX predicated on the global redistribution of wealth.</p>
			<p id="p524">1) The data in the IPCC is useless. This is a policy statement prepared by politicians. They add enough "science" by "scientists" to make it appear credible. These "scientists" were paid by these politicians to produce this policy statement. It you don't see an inherent problem with this, don't bother reading any further.</p>
			<p id="p525">2) The IPCC report had to be "amended" over and over again. The hockey stick graph has been eliminated, owing to the fact that it was discredited about as soon as it came out. In the beginning there was a statement in the IPCC that there was NO evidence that man was impacting climate change. This was removed as it did not fit their agenda. Several scientists left the panel when they saw the inaccuracies and exaggerations in the report. At least one scientist sued to have his name removed.</p>
			<p id="p526">3) There are several petitions signed by more than 400 scientists, and thousands of people, that do not agree with the IPCC. There were about 52 "scientists" with the IPCC. There is NO consensus! If you were to poll scientists "anonymously" the vast majority would not agree with the IPCC. It must be anonymous so they won't lose their funding.</p>
			<p id="p527">4) The models they used do not take in to consideration such things as solar activity, precipitation and cloud cover. The models themselves are not worthy of any consideration with out those three elements. Think about it, the three elements that OBVIOUSLY influence the temperature the most aren't even addressed.</p>
			<p id="p528">5) Thus, this report is so fundamentally flawed that any true (non government funded) scientist would disregard it. This report is based loosely on "correlation" only. Correlation does not mean causation! There was just an article published that owing to the fact that there are fewer pirates there is global warming, same correlation.</p>
			<p id="p529">6) AGW doesn’t even pass the most basic “smell test”. CO2 makes up .004% of the atmosphere, there in NO way this extremely small percentage, even if doubled, could impact the temperature as they are inclined to say it “does”.</p>
			<p id="p530">7) There is NO scientific proof of AGW. There is, however, proof that the increase in CO2 occurs after the warming. This would make much more sense. As the majority of the CO2 on earth is maintained in the oceans, as they warm they release more CO2. If the CO2 caused the warming it would trigger an unstoppable (regardless of what man did) release of CO2 from the oceans in a never ending cycle. As the earth has warmed and cooled repeatedly, we know that this cannot be true.</p>
			<p id="p531">8) The earth was cooling up until the 70s, right during the midst of historical CO2 production that should not have happened. The earth has not warmed since 1998, right when China and India have come on-line with massive amounts of CO2, this too, should be impossible. 2007 was no warmer. We are having record cold in 2008, record cold last year in the southern hemisphere. AGW doesn't even pass the most basic "smell test". Last years temperatures just wiped out the .7 degree increase.</p>
			<p id="p532">9) Its called WEATHER. It gets warmer and cooler; the poles have even been known to switch with each other. There have been ice ages, warm periods, and it will continue to be that way. This is the most inane crap that man has ever contrived!</p>
			<p id="p533">I agree that we all need to be better stewards of the environment, but this is not the way to do it. I was around in the 70s when the next ice age was coming, as I am a climber I couldn't wait...oh well. Maybe now I can get my wish, better get back in shape.</p>

What a bunch of morons. Anyway, if you've been in the debate long enough you'll know what the word explicitly means. If not, then you are apparently ignorant. Which might be true anyway.</p>

			<p id="p575">I have also looked into the data myself.</p>
			<p id="p576">Google searching turns up a lot.</p>
			<p id="p577">Experiments intended to show CO2 as a GW gas: they took concentrated CO2, and compared it to the same quantity of air; and, aimed a light at them ... the CO2 got 20% warmer than the air.</p>
			<p id="p578">Measurements of CO2 in the troposphere: numbers varied depending on the source ... the #1 source use by most was at an active Hawaiian volcano (when looking for natural CO2 sources I found that volcanos where way up there - we are talking mass quantities, trees dying because of too much CO2 being produced by the volcano, for example, that would be like a person dying from too much oxygen).</p>
			<p id="p579">One of the claims is that in the past hundred years CO2 has gone up by 180ppm and that because mankind has produced so much CO2 in the last hundred years it must be our fault.</p>
			<p id="p580">Fact is most of the CO2 we produce gets consumed by trees and plants.</p>
			<p id="p581">Must of our highways are lined with trees and/or plants. In the case of sea side factories, the green living things in the water will consume most of the CO2 produced.</p>
			<p id="p582">CO2 is heavy and tends to sink.</p>
			<p id="p583">As for the 180ppm of CO2: Even if we go with that; and, the CO2 as an AGW gas guess what we get ...</p>
			<p id="p584">If the net temp increase was .5 degrees, 20% of .5 is .01 times 180 parts/per 1,000,000 - take a way some zeros 18/100,000, 1.8/10,000, .18/1000, .018/100, .0018/10, .00018 - now finish the multiplication - .01 * .00018 = .0000018 degrees difference accounted for by CO2 (assuming no wind to reduce its surface temp); or, in other words, with CO2 at 200ppm the effect would have been 20 millionths of a degree, and now we would be 38 millionths of a degree.</p>
			<p id="p585">Also found out that O2 has nearly the same absorption spectra as CO2.</p>
			<p id="p586">Thats right, based on Absorption spectra, O2 (Oxygen) is a Green House Gas.</p>
			<p id="p587">Ok, lets do some more math (sorry if your head hurts): O2 21% of air * 20% (same spectra probably same AGW effect) = 4% (rounded down for you) * .5 degrees=.02 degrees impact. So thats .02 degrees of impact for O2 and .0000038 degrees impact for current levels of CO2.</p>
			<p id="p588">If your not worried about the small number for O2, then why would you be worried about the multiple orders of magnitude smaller number for CO2?</p>
			<p id="p589">Conclusion: if hundreds of scientists (listed as members of the IPCC) are not complete idiots; then the IPCC is not speaking for them.</p>
			<p id="p590">By the way, as early as the beginning of the 15th Cen they were finding new ways to prove the sun revolved around the earth and that the earth was the center of the universe ... Ah Ha that means we are the center of the universe ... Who needs facts?</p>

			<p id="p600">If you are going to quote a study that goes clearly against the body of evidence, you might want to at least look at the chart and see if it supports your assertion. Look at the incredibly high CO2 concentrations from the Cambrian period. At that point CO2 concentrations were over 18 TIMES as high as today. Also note that over the chart's period there is NO CORRELATION of CO2 and temperature. This much is visually obvious and doesn't require any statistical analysis. Just look at the period from ~325 to ~375...basically constant temperature yet a sixfold drop in concentration from 2500ppm to ~400ppm. Thanks for making our point for us. Excellent job.</p>

			<p id="p611">Okay since you apparently are impervious to logical arguments, here's a short summary of your plot which you claim supports the effect of CO2 on global temperature on a geologic timescale:</p>
			<p id="p612">In the Cambrian period CO2 varied by a factor of two with no effect on temperature.</p>
			<p id="p613">In the end of the Ordovician period the temperature dropped by a giant margin and then millions of years later went right back up, with no appreciable change in CO2.</p>
			<p id="p614">In the Silurian period the CO2 dropped by a factor of two, then went up by nearly a factor of two, with no effect on CO2.</p>
			<p id="p615">At the end of the Devonian period, the CO2 dropped from 4000 to about 200 (similar to current levels) and yet the temperature remained nearly the same for nearly 100 MILLION years before entering another low area, and CO2 was essentially constant for at least 25 MILLION years before the temperatures plummeted.</p>
			<p id="p616">In the sole era where you could say CO2 and temperature might be related, the end of the Permian age indicates temperature started rising probably well before CO2.</p>
			<p id="p617">In the Jurassic era CO2 goes from 1000 to nearly 3000 and the temp is unchanged.</p>
			<p id="p618">Then thru the Cretacious and Teriary eras the CO2 drops from nearly 3000 to about 300 and the temperature remains constant for about 100 MILLION years.</p>
			<p id="p619">So we have 7 eras where it is obvious that temperature and CO2 are NOT related, and one where they might be. Excluding your other factors (aerosols and Orbital forcing (sorry but that's on much, much smaller timeframes)) it's pretty evident that there is no direct correlation.</p>
			<p id="p620">You want to call the Devonian drop CO2 before temperature. Fine. So the timescale for correlation of a drop in CO2 from 4000 to 300 is in the range of 100 million years. So the corresponding increase from 300 to 4000 should take another 100 million years. I'll stop buying carbon credits now.</p>

They think the earth's climate is a closed system that follows the laws of thermodynamics, but only in a chaos-theory sorta way. "If you fart in Quangzhou a waterspout forms off of Key Largo." If the ice caps melt, we cool off temporarily. Come on... The thermohaline cycle of the oceans move at a snails-pace. Plus, last I checked, cold water sinks due to higher density.

Allow the ice to melt (hell, even cover the glass if you would like to in order to limit evaporation). What will happen?? The water will not overflow the glass. Ever.

Finally things got so bad that is was quite evident that the ozone layer was being damaged and the evidence strongly pointed to aerosol. So governments around the world started to ban aerosol. The US finally saw the light and stepped in line. We can now see that the layer is repairing itself many years after the ban. It will take some time for it to fully repair itself.</p>

Maybe the fact that the US was one of the FIRST countries to start banning aerosols, one of the original 28 signers of the Vienna Convention, etc. all missed your attention. The effect was first hypothesized in 1973 and confirmed in 1976, followed by a series of studies to determine it's actual atmospheric effect (including studies on determining how it could reach the upper atmosphere to have an effect). It took about 5 years for the data sets to be collected and clear, and another 3 years until the Vienna Convention.

A few other countries, including the United States, Canada, and Norway, followed suit later that year, but the European Community rejected an analogous proposal. Even in the U.S., chlorofluorocarbons continued to be used in other applications, such as refrigeration and industrial cleaning, until after the discovery of the Antarctic ozone hole in 1985. After negotiation of an international treaty (the Montreal Protocol), CFC production was sharply limited beginning in 1987 and phased out completely by 1996.</p>

			<p id="p747">I made no such suggestion. All I said was that there was a lot of conflicting evidence. In fact, the first such evidence of a Antartic ozone hole was automatically thrown OUT because the numbers were sooo far away from anything expected, they were assumed to be a measurement error. In fact it took roughly three years to conclude that the data was real and the hole existed. During this giant 10 year period from confirmation of discovery thru banning, there was a lot of healthy arguments in the scientific community...something that is still lacking in today's AGW dispute.</p>
			<p id="p748">The original poster blamed the US for blocking the ban, but looking at the facts, the US was in the lead in all of the original and most of the subsequent research and was a cosigner of the first and then all of the subsequent deals, over the objections of giant corporations like DuPont, etc. Blaming the US for CFCs is revisionist history, period.</p>

			<p id="p813">To MadMaster's point, the main issue with the graph is that not only are CO2 and temperature clearly NOT related, but also that the most dominant average temperature is nearly 10 degrees C above today's temp. You claim that "we will not" be happy with 50,000ppm. Yet there is no geologic evidence that 50,000ppm would cause a giant rise in global temperature. So what evidence do you have that it will? Please don't quote the hockey stick. You do know that we are still in the lower end of the temperature scale in geologic terms. The actual global average temperature in 2001 was 14.52 degrees C.

			<p id="p885">I absolutely agree that pollution is an important issue. I hate particulates and toxic chemicals in the air, and I'd love to have a wide variety of cleaner and cheaper energy sources to choose from. However, CO2 is NOT a pollutant, particulate, or toxic chemical! We are doing ourselves a huge disservice focusing on such a benign gas! CO2 doesn't do a lick of harm to asthma sufferers or those with heart disease or lung disorders... Its clean and clear! Trees love it!

The reason is a lot of them are based on traditional agriculture without irrigation and are much more exposed to the weather. In developed countries, you just turn up the AC...</p>
			<p id="p894">It can even be argued that global warming has already caused a lot of the problems in Africa (lake Chad dried up because of a prolonged drought, and it being dry might be the new 'norm' http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Chad ). Again, I can't pin this exactly on global warming, but it is predicted that a good portion of Africa will get dryer. This will cause more difficulties for the people that live there...</p>

			<p id="p918">This article is a gross misrepresentation of the underlying data, which you can find here.</p>
			<p id="p919">We are not about to enter an ice age. Any implication that we are is just plain false. 2007 was in fact the 2nd hottest year on record after 2005. The 8 hottest years on record since 1880 occurred in the last 10 years.</p>
			<p id="p920">The data used in this report is comparing the difference in temperature each month from the global average baseline temperature between 1951 and 1980. So if the data shows a temperature of 0, that would mean the temperature that month was exactly the average of the baseline temperature. If the number is negative, then the temperature is lower than average, etc..</p>
			<p id="p921">Back to the article - What the article is actually reporting is that the temperature in the month of January 2008 was lower than the temperature in the month of January 2007 when using this delta tracking method. This is supported by the underlying data. What the story leaves out is the fact that January 2007 was the hottest month on record. The data from NASA goes back to 1880.</p>
			<p id="p922">On top of that, January 2007 wasn’t just a little hotter than any other month, it was a lot hotter. It was twice as hot as January 2006, for example.</p>
			<p id="p923">The headline also implies that we’ve had twelve months of cooling, when in fact 2007 was the second hottest year on record (after 2005). Check the data if you want.</p>
			<p id="p924">The primary reason the reporter can say that January 2008 is much lower than January 2007 is that January 2007 was so hot. So we’ve hardly wiped out a century of warming in 2007.</p>
			<p id="p925">I’m guessing Michael Asher didn’t run an article last year saying that we’ve had the biggest gain in world temperature ever, much worse than the last 50 years of global warming. Because he could have, using the same standards applied in this article.</p>
			<p id="p926">The story goes on to claim that solar variances have a greater impact than man made changes to the climate. This is not correct either. The facts on the solar variance impact can be found in this document from NASA.</p>
			<p id="p927">The facts are that solar variances from sunspot activity results in a variance of 0.3 Watts per meter squared. That means at the peak of the solar sunspot activity there is 0.3 more Watts per meter squared than at the minimum point.</p>
			<p id="p928">Man made CO2 warming adds 0.3 Watts per meter squared every decade.</p>
			<p id="p929">The sunspot activity goes up and down on a very regular sine wave like oscillation of about 11 years. We are now at a minimum in the sunspot activity cycle. The first sunspot of the new cycle was spotted in January.</p>
			<p id="p930">So we are at a low point in the solar sunspot activity and last year we had the 2nd hottest year on record. That leaves you wondering what is going to happen over the next 5 years as we add 0.3 Watts/m2 from sunspot activity and another 0.15 Watts/m2 from human activity.</p>
			<p id="p931">The most likely outcome of continuing business as usual is that the trend over the next few years will be to continue the warming trend.</p>
			<p id="p932">If you look at the historical data, this type of temperature noise spike followed by a steep decline in temperature has occurred before.</p>
			<p id="p933">The January 1987 temp was 0.25 above average, the January 1988 temp was 0.52 above average (or about double), the January 1989 temp was 0.03 above average. We’d never seen a hotter month before (January 88) and then twelve months later we’d never seen a drop like that before, either. But after that, we were back to increasing temperature. It was just a bit of noise in the inexorable climb of world temperature.</p>
			<p id="p934">Global warming is real. It isn’t going to go away by itself. We’re not about to enter an ice age.</p>

			<p id="p937">granted yes, saying that we are about to enter another ice-age is a bit over the top (however, I believe most of the statements like that are used in a sort of sarcastic way, like a surprise sucker punch compared to how things were projected, by the models, to occur) and I don't believe anyone here has denied that the earth has experienced, in truth, a modest warming trend, however, and yes, this cold spike could very well just be exactly that, an abrupt spike. That's not to say, however, that it could not be a trend of things to come. That's the problem with this darn debate and the major reason why nothing intelligent has been done concerning it; no one is taking the time to just step back and approach this with a calm scientific analysis of data from EVERY side, without jumping to one conclusion or another.</p>
			<p id="p938">I would like to say though, that history shows that other global warming trends have indeed "gone away" so to speak by themselves through the natural patterns of the earth and universe upon which we rely for life.</p>

			<p id="p940">The real spike that folks should be looking at is the fact that January 2007 was by far and away the hottest month on record.</p>
			<p id="p941">To report that we had a month in January 2008 where the temperature was lower than the hottest month ever on record is not particularily newsworthy, nor is it a sign of a long term trend.</p>
			<p id="p942">We are entering a period in the solar sunspot activity cycle where the energy from the sun will be increasing each year over the next 5 years. This natural forcing factor will be combined with the human produced CO2 emmissions to create another dramatic increase in warming after the warmest decade on record.</p>
			<p id="p943">The other trend you should be looking at are the spikes in insurance claim payments due to weather related claims.</p>
			<p id="p944">"Weather-related insurance losses rose to $50 billion in 2005 from less than $10 billion a decade earlier."</p>
			<p id="p945">"Over the past year alone, insurance companies have dramatically raised homeowners' annual premiums in parts of Texas, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Massachusetts and New York State. In the Florida Keys, for instance, windstorm insurance rates for a 1,900-square-foot home in Monroe County soared from $3,000 in 2004 to nearly $16,000 in 2007. In South Carolina private companies have stopped insuring homes valued at less than $500,000. In Rhode Island some agencies have refused to cover any coastal properties. Allstate, one of the largest residential property insurers on the east coast, elected not to renew 30,000 policies covering coastal properties in New York City, Long Island, Westchester County and Connecticut, and is considering reducing coastal area coverage in Massachusetts and along the Gulf."</p>
			<p id="p946">The trend in the industry is that the insurance companies are recognizing that climate change is real and they are actively seeking to reduce their risk from global warming.</p>
			<p id="p947">The insurance companies make their business decisions on hard data. What do they know that you don't?</p>

			<p id="p949">to say that all businesses, whether u mean just insurance or not, is a lie, there have been plenty of companies that do things to get a good buck, All-state was just called out for it for misusing figures to raise rates in Florida, (and Enron didn't get very far on it's hard data, did it?). But yes i'm sure they have taken into account that the sea levels have risen ver slightly every year, and that the possibility that the warm water temperatures might attribute to more hurricanes, etc. but i would doubt very highly that they have taken their information in concern with other forms of climate change, such as wind patterns, solar influences, etc. Again we come to the same problem, just because someone or a group does something (especially when it is a company interested in its finacial well being, which i don't think of as a bad idea) in coorolation to a particular finding doesn't mean it's cause to rule out the other factors, which scientists are currently attempting to analyze and which could support the hypothesis that there could be more cold weather to come, it's still without a bout up in the air.

			<p id="p971">The essence of climate is change, evolution, cyclicality. It's idiotic to speak of "climate change" as if it is the advent of some newly discovered phenomenon. So let's just call it weather. Obviously from climate records, weather changes within even 50 year periods are often simply a natural cycling of oceanic and atmospheric tendencies. BFD. Anyone looking at the mid-troposphere temperature charts brought to us by satellite ( http://www.junkscience.com/MSU_Temps/Warming_Look.... will note the record &amp; gigantic EL Nino of '97-98. How surprising that ocean and global land temps elevated thereafter (at least in the northern hemisphere), and are now coming down as evinced by the 2007-2008 decline in that record of approximately 0.60°C. The raised-temp anomaly is petering out. BFD. All the hysteria induced by over-caffeinated environmentalists and wishful media drones was, yet again, misplaced emotionalism and childish fatalism that arises in cycles as prevalent as temporarily-enduring changes in the weather, oceans and mid atmosphere. 9/11 has warped an unprecedented number of personal psychologies, especially in those most exposed to its tragic images (the media ilk), and those most guilt-ridden about living in the highly consumptive and highly productive USA (the socialists, greenies and sundry malcontents who would denigrate Paradise for its pleasantly immutable continuum). With the sun going into timid mode, CO2 is deflating as the socio-economic bane exceeded only by Jack the Ripper or HIV. While fatal heat waves have been common throughout history, record cold and record snow in the last few years are really the anomalies of significance. Such are known to precede ice ages, precipitation for which is induced by a period of warming weather that is but a gnat's hair on the astrophysical time scale. So the foolish Cassandras and Tiresiass who ride their bikes with a bag of CFLs should just shut up for a while and cool it. Unusually hot weather occurred for modest periods prior to Henry Ford and Eli Whitney, as did imposingly icy periods that kicked Greenland's arse and dug out all the beautiful lakes in the Midwest. It's just the world; mostly saltwater, wrapped in an atmospheric blanket and bombarded by solar flux - victim of an interplay of natural forces that cycle up and down. Just because a few insects of green hue have learned how to trumpet like discomfited elephants is by no means grounds for mass hysteria; even if half of them are liberal-arts majors pontificating from the media pulpit, espousing "scientific fact" like herbal supplement hawkers in infomercials. We've become unnecessarily overwhelmed by such "information sources" because most of us are too lazy to devote time to research of scientific articles on the web. Unwilling to master new terminology and concepts with our overtaxed noggins, we feast at the trough of pre-canned, sensationalist-media Pablum that any cub reporter can lace with epithets and phrases that leave no room for doubt or debate, ostensibly.</p>
			<p id="p972">****</p>
			<p id="p973">Of all that is allegedly unusual today, the most alarming has to be the tendency toward mass hysteria about the "unusual" weather, and even more so the inclination of utterly unscientific politicians to almost immediately generate wrong-headed legislation to outlaw Edison's masterpiece, tax the hell out of everyone in a fantastical attempt to "limit carbon emissions to safe levels," and to impose urban entry fees on drivers efficiently hauling the largest loads. Do-gooder insanity! And a 'good' based on insufficient science still in acrimonious debate (hidden from the public by liberal TV media, but not the Net). But the facts never caused hesitation in politicians when they saw a ripe opportunity. As we are hysterical together, so we will be unfairly taxed together. We had to learn...when a mass movement arose not against a foreign enemy, but against ourselves and way of life. Somehow, the guilt Gorgon, that had for centuries been kept restrained in the church basement, has sneaked into the popular, secular conscience, its cells dividing like evil yeast that clot the synapses across which impulses of reason and skepticism once spryly jumped with relative ease. Oh my GOD! We're doomed for enjoying life and consumerism! CO2 sinning is rampant! Polar bears are drifting on rudderless bergs to their demise! Getting on an airliner is akin to visiting a whorehouse! Clinical self-consciousness IS appropriate each time you throw plastic or food in the trash! Corn is better placed in our fuel tanks than into the mouths of starving millions! SENSE A GREEN THEME HERE? If the 3.4% of our population that is homosexual can introduce hate-crimes laws affecting us all, and elementary-school texts that normalize pathological-gender concepts...don't be surprised when eco-morphs upset national economies and reverse the decline in world starvation as a tolerable sacrifice to the higher, anti-capitalist, anti-industrialism goal. Organized, over-educated yuppies were bound to trump the status-quo, dinosaur politicians at their own game. Computer illiteracy has its price...</p>

			<p id="p1018">Michael,</p>
			<p id="p1019">Could you please explain why you believe there is global cooling?</p>
			<p id="p1020">From the graph you provided, it seems pretty clear that, on average, the trend in temperatures is going up , and not down , as your article suggests.</p>
			<p id="p1021">Yes, the latest month has been lower, but it is still in the positive range (as in, no cooling has taken place, it is still warmer than whatever baseline you're comparing to). However, by looking at the graph, it appears as that the temperature has only gone down in the past month or 2 months, and disregards the trend that seems pretty clear over the last decade.</p>
			<p id="p1022">Again, I don't really understand where you're getting the cooling from, so if I'm reading this incorrectly, please let me know.</p>
			<p id="p1023">Also, how can you dismiss a trend that has been happening over decades with data from a single month? Something seems fishy here.</p>

			<p id="p1027">Look at the graph again. The part highlighting from Jan 07 to Jan 08, an entire year, a majority of which the temperature is dropping shortly. Am I missing something?</p>
			<p id="p1028">&gt; "it seems pretty clear that, on average, the trend in temperatures is going up "</p>
			<p id="p1029">Good question. It all depends on scale. From 1998, the trend is downward...but from 1900 onward, there's still a very slight upward trend. But if one looks back further still (say from 500 AD onward), the trend is cooling again. The earth is cooler now than it was then.</p>
			<p id="p1030">Look back a few more thousand years to the last Ice Age, and the earth is on a warming trend. Look all the way back to the Devonian, and we're cooling again.</p>
			<p id="p1031">So which of these is the "right" period to examine? Depends on what you're trying to prove of course.</p>
			<p id="p1032">&gt; "...with data from a single month?"</p>
			<p id="p1033">Actually, the cooling trend dates back a full year (according to GISS), or back as far as 1998, according to sources like Hadley.</p>

			<p id="p1158">Most expensive weather caused disasters have all happened in the past 5 years. - This has nothing to do with Global Warming or Climate Change. We live in bigger more expensive houses and own more goodies. People are also getting dumber and building more in disaster zones because it is cheaper.

			<p id="p1159">Most wettest / hottest / coldest / driest (in other word extreme) weather has happened in the past 10 years. - Not really, hottest recorded temperatures were in the 1930's. We have only been recording weather for about 150 years out of 4.5 billion so we don't know when the most extreme weather occurred.</p>
			<p id="p1160">First Hurricane in documented history (so since at least 200-300 years) has hit South America from the southern Atlantic Ocean. - Also had a year (2006) with no hurricanes making landfall in North America.</p>
			<p id="p1161">Arctic Ocean no longer freezing so safe crossing levels since the past 5 to 10 years (for the people living in Greenland for example). - This is not a new phenomenon and has been recorded by other explorers of other centuries. Also, why did they name it Greenland? Could it be because it was not covered in ice when they named it?</p>
			<p id="p1162">In 2003 or 2004 (I think, I forgot the exact date), parts of the Amazon forest got so dry (we’re talking about a tropical rainforest here…), it caught on fire - The number one destroyer of rainforest space is being done by farmers so they can grow corn and produce biofuel.

			<p id="p1175">After years of spending billions of dollars collecting temp data, the scientific community should be able to produce a correlation coefficient for global warming. This would tell us what the relative cause and effect that the independent variables have on global warming. In this case, global warming would be the dependent variable and the most likely independent variables (from published studies) would be sun spot activity, CO2 conc., methane conc., ocean currents, etc. The scientist should be able to calculate with their vast amounts of data first and second order effects along with any interaction effects among the indpendent variables. From this, they would have a statistically sound cause and effect analysis that would tell us which causes are the most significant with regards to global warming. This would end most of the debate that we see in the press on this issue.</p>
			<p id="p1176">I suspect if they did this simple correlation, they might come up with the fact that CO2 has a very tiny effect on global warming... thus drying up their funding and ruining their socialist political agenda.

It's unfortunate that republicans spin this data so hard that their followers don't believe it. It's incredible really. Republicans would rather believe a talk show host or republican blogger than a scientist.</p>

He's got his own axe to grind, and makes all kinds of ridiculous mistakes. But if you open your eyes, look at the data, it's easy to see, we are causing global warming. It's not much. a couple degrees F per hundred years. That's it.</p>

			<p id="p1229">Considering that CO2 has been fluctuating during the last 500,000+ years between 180 and 300 ppm, I am not sure how you can derive such a conclusion. In addition, NOAA states:</p>
			<p id="p1230">quote:</p>
			<p id="p1231">2. You're right in what you state implicitly: there is no 'ideal' concentration and no 'perfect' climate. I am not sure anybody a little bit serious has defended such a position, or a serious clarification of the definition of 'ideal' and 'perfect' should be provided. On the other hand, there are definitely bad concentrations, but we're far from them. However, there is definitely a climate (weather patterns, water resources, sea level) under which most major infrastructures of current civilization have developed (major ports, major cities, location and types of crops ...). Reshuffling these patterns is likely to cost a lot in an adaptation process (whether it's money or lives for some).</p>

			<p id="p1234">We could exchange citations with regard to atmospheric CO2 concentrations and their cause over past 500,000 years all day long but unless and until you answer my first question the discussion is moot. I want to know what is the mechanism whereby changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration leads to drastic changes in our climate. In addition, just stating that some concentrations are bad without somehow quantifying your argument is deliciously vague but not too helpful to the discussion. If we know that change in CO2 concentration causes climate change there must be some optimum range for this gas that we would find acceptable;if so, how do we attain and maintain this range? It also follows that if there is an upper limit that is acceptable there must also exist a lower limit that would yield adverse results in the other direction. If we do not know any of these things what are we doing banning and/or regulating everything from cow flatulence to incandescent bulbs. We are blindly flailing about looking for solutions when we really don't have enought knowledge to intelligently define the problem. Ready, Fire, Aim.</p>

			<p id="p1251">No wait actually that has never happened what has happened is that people who think eating a burger and smoking makes you worse than stalin or hitler and people who think pollution is a lie and that the international communist conspiracy seeks to sap our precious bodily fluids have been screaming and yelling their biased opinions based on</p>
			<p id="p1252">pseudoscience sensationalism or twisting facts and researches or even constructing facts to support them.</p>
			<p id="p1253">There is no conclusive evidence on either side. We may or may not affect the climate. From what i've read and heard and watched its 50-50. But THAT is not important. What is important is that climate is not or has ever been normal like so many other have said before. That is a fact. which means that the climate will change whether we affect it or not. Which in turn means that trying to "fix" it will not help in the long term. What must be done is study it with un-biased cold logic and from what i've seen that is not happening.</p>
			<p id="p1254">On one side the tree-hugers value their nature above man as if man and his works are unnatural. Which of course is impossible since man is a natural being bound by the laws of nature even the ones unknown to him like everything else in the universe and so anything he does cannot be unnatural by logic. Only beneficial or damaging to him and things around him. Humans live in nature and off it not outside of it and for it.</p>
			<p id="p1255">The conservatives on the other hand, people who think that the right to health care is dependent on how much money you make so people with 1000000 $ a year is only fair to receive better health care than people with 25000$ a year and that compassion and humanity equals the rise of stalin and pol-pot think that no matter what we do has no effect what so ever and that conservation, research in non-finite power sources and feeling sick to your stomach when right wing redneck pigs like the you know who go hunting wingless birds for fun is gay.</p>

			<p id="p1257">Adapt our selves and our economies through technology to a world where the fact that everything constantly changes (ARISTOTLE) so we must follow OR PERISH becomes dogma</p>
			<p id="p1258">Global warming or cooling, naturally occurring ice ages and temperature variations that threaten our way of life have been around since the beginning of the earth long before man. None of that should have anything to do with i.e. reducing pollution. We should reduce pollution because it degrades our quality of life. We should move away from finite power sources to renewables because finite powers sources well THEY RUN OUT! counties SHOULD PROTECT THEIR ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE THEIR CITIZENS LIVE IN IT NOT BECAUSE AL GORE OR A VERY VERY SAD PANDA COME TO GREECE TO BATHE US IN THEIR INFINITE WISDOM! They should move away from oil because nobody in their right mind wants to be Dependant of people like putin or shavez for their daily survival.</p>
			<p id="p1259">Greece is a good example of that. We produce electricity from domestic coal and import oil ready made electricity and natural gas to sustain our needs. Now if greece exploits its alternative resources (according to greek state university studies we can produce almost 40% of our</p>
			<p id="p1260">needs from alternates) it so happens that greece will be able to produce ALL the power we need from DOMESTIC SOURCES instead of being constantly blackmailed but the Russians or the dogs that regulate oil prices or Iran and OPEK or whoever. Yes we will still import oil for other uses but as a greek i say that it is better to reduce foreign dependency anyway we can even if the price is high and the power bill doubles. I am certain that oil will go at 150 and eventually 200$ and i refuse to submit to such extortion when there is a way to reduce its effects and if we have to bite the bullet of higher billing so be it.</p>

			<p id="p1369">Also please note that one of the major points people made about global warming was not that it was increasing the temperature of the earth, but the fact that all the CO2 we are putting into the air is being absorbed by the biggest carbon sink we have, the ocean. The levels of carbon in the ocean are so extreme right now that is already affecting the feeder species (lowest part of the food chain) Also please do not forget the amount of damage we are already doing by hunting further down the food chain, as we kill of predator fish.</p>

			<p id="p1419">Ok, after reading the umpteen posts on this, I felt I had to weigh in. I've got some background in this, several months of research back in school, before anyone flames me. Rationally, I think most people can agree that Global Warming/Cimate change is a complex issue. There really is no right and wrong, the warmers being all right or the coolers being all right. From my research of the IPCC site (scoff at their nobel prize all you want) and the the GISS site http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs/ it appears that this new data is simply a variation. We may simply be in a "trough" of the variation, lets look at next year before we make any sweeping conclusions.</p>
			<p id="p1420">My main beef with many who say their opinions are the end all be all is that this issue is way too complex for anyone to say "oh well this is all politically motivated bs". When we look at the warming side of the matter, CO2, methane, and a handful of other gases are known "climate forcing" agents, wiki it. They trap sunlight. Heat the earth. However water vapor is the main "greenhouse gas" More of it in the air, the more heat earth can absorb. Ahh, but the catch is that water vapor also contributes to cloud formation, which reflects sunlight and thus "forces" a global cooling effect, ref: http://ams.allenpress.com/perlserv/?request=get-ab... from the american meteorological society. Another link summarizing http://www.cfact.org/site/view_article.asp?idCateg...</p>
			<p id="p1421">I also have to agree that the suns radiative output reaching earth has to do alot with our temps, however is jury is still how the sun works, so scientists need more time. One last thing I want to mention is about the oceans, outgassing of CO2 and methane hydrates, you know the nifty ice like substance thats supposed to replace oil?, well outgassing of that is bad and that happens when the oceans warm, which they have been, and all this WILL cause + temp climate forcing, no doubt. Can cloud cover counteract that force? We, meaning scientists, concerned citizens, will not know until computer models get better. Finally, this is not liberal hippy junk, read it all, read the links, the data. My opinion does not color what I just wrote, its the facts. Point of fact, dumping tons upon tons of carbon into the atmosphere HAS an effect, fact, and clear cutting forests, natural carbon sinks, also HAS an effect, now will someone venture to guess what those effects are?</p>

			<p id="p1424">Carbon sequestration? Where does the wood go, now that we no longer burn it for fuel? It goes into furniture, houses, recyclable paper and cardboard. Little of it is landfilled, and the high quality furniture even from Ikea (compared to their original crappy designs) is hardly ever thrown away. At best it's sold at a garage sale or handed out to children when the parents grow rich enough to buy a step-up in quality.</p>
			<p id="p1425">Then new trees are planted, very fast growing breeds, which are again clearcut, and tons and tons of carbon dioxide are removed from the air.</p>
			<p id="p1426">Your comments are great, one of the few that are balanced, but it also says science needs more time (and money) all the while politicians and lobby groups are SCREAMING WITH PANIC to force upon us the largest economic shut down in history besides the fall of the Roman Empire. And as their scientific "consensus" is being debunked as we speak, they are becoming more and more shrill and, well crazy, developing blindspots as they are blindsided by real science and are causing a massive backlash not only against climate science, but against all of it, now beginning to include the equally politicized from pseudo-science of nutrition research and the old or new "fool pyramid" which by odd coincidence exactly coincided with a massive obesity epidemic in modern societies.</p>
			<p id="p1427">At least nutrition myths like "fat makes you fat" do not amount to an end-of-the-world doomsday religion. Note that literal biblical Creationism is *still* a major force in the USA, all because Genesis got a few details dead wrong.</p>

			<p id="p1472">Just do the math- the earth experiences 15 pounds of atmosphere on every square inch of its surface. Its diameter is prox 8000 miles. the formula for the surface of a sphere is 4 times pi (3.1416) times r squared (1/2 of 8000= 4000) and comes to 2201062400 square miles, times 27878400 (5280 squared) comes to 5605298012160000 square feet, times 144 (square inches per sq foot) and comes to 807162913751040000 square inches, times 15 (pounds per square inch), that comes to 12107443706265600000 pounds of atmosphere (air) weiging down on the surface of the planet. The global out put of greenhouse gasses is 25000000000 metric tons times 2205 pounds per ton=55125000000000 pounds.</p>
			<p id="p1473">round both numbers and we get:</p>
			<p id="p1474">Air= 12000000000000000000</p>
			<p id="p1475">120000000 divided by 55 = 2181818.1818, or 1 part per 2.18 million.</p>
			<p id="p1476">That is prox .48 ppm (LESS THAN 2 parts per million per year) that we (ALL of mankind's industry) added (in 2000). This guy is hollaring about 383 parts per million of greenhouse gasses now in the air- we are causing less than one half ppm (part per million).</p>
			<p id="p1477">here is an exerpt (from the link below the excerpt):</p>
			<p id="p1478">The new data from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration also suggest that the rate of increase of the gas may have accelerated in the last two years. Carbon dioxide emissions, mainly from burning fossil fuels, are thought to be a principle cause of global warming.</p>
			<p id="p1479">Recordings from a volcano-top observatory, NOAA's Mauna Loa Observatory on Hawaii, showed carbon dioxide levels had risen to an average of about 376 parts per million (ppm) for 2003.</p>
			<p id="p1480">When the US team started recording atmospheric carbon dioxide in the late 1950s, levels were around 315 ppm and have risen ever since.</p>
			<p id="p1481">in 1950 we were emitting 1/5 of what we are today. If we add one quarter ppm (we added much less)over the last 50 years average, then we added 12.5 ppm (much more than we have added and not counting the normal gas recycling of the planets ecosystem)in the last 50 years.</p>
			<p id="p1482">Since the forests have been depleted, the normal recycling amount has decreased, and the difference between 1950 and 2000 is 61 ppm (376-315), then deforesatation or normal fluctuation has to account for much more than 48.5 ppm (61ppm-12.5ppm).</p>
			<p id="p1483">Al Gore was sitting next to a medical doctor in an upscale D.C. bar, and he was telling the doc about his findings. How the human race is responsible for all the increase in greenhouse gas. The doc sez, in reply, "you could use an upper colonic".

Truth is we (or most of us) have no idea really what is going on. We blame 'natural, super-natural, consuming, destroying forests, etc) Yes I am sure maybe all these are true.</p>
			<p id="p1489">But what bothers me is that 1st. We as a developed country, and those that are racing to be like us, are like rats. Comsume, polute, and do more damage because "we have a right to" and pass off the personal responsibility leaving it up to the 'others' to fix it so we can drive our SUV to pick up our latte. (figure of speach folks). Then we poke in the dark at what what we know little about. Yes we have ice cores, some fossel records that show some things. But yet the media never seems to release 'other' data because it does not serve thier purpose. Case in point (we have to blame CO2 if we want to Tax it). I believe we should all be green, but do not believe it will help what is happening. Like putting a sumppump next the levy in the south. But will can still be better humans.</p>
			<p id="p1490">Holding back information from the public is also to blame as is dis-information. Such as was anyone aware that not only is our atmosphere changing, so are the 'other' planets within our solar system? Interesting eh? This is verified by NASA from what I had read on thier website. Something about atmospheric density and at least one other..forgive my details (you can go look foryourself), has changes it's pole. We are creatures that get too comfortable and fat, my friends...time is a changing and it should be interesting. As much as we think we can 'fix' everything, we are still at the mercy of the ever changing enviorment and idiots if we think we can change it without causing other problems..we still have alot to learn. Do your research, and do not follow the main stream media as law..(remember it's purpose is to draw you attention, to sell ad space...but that is a topic for somewhere else).</p>

			<p id="p1492">The year without a summer.....</p>
			<p id="p1493">The year 1816 was famous as "the year without a summer." That year started out, in Stanley as well as other regions of the south, so mild for the months of January and February that many folks let their fires go out and burned wood only for cooking; however, March was very cold and windy. Showers started the Month of April but ended with snow and ice. In May the temperature was like that of winter. The young buds that began forming in April were stiff and frozen. Ice, one half inch thick formed on ponds and rivers in North and South Carolina. Corn was killed and after being planted again and again nothing was reaped from the cornfields. June was cold, the coldest month ever experienced in this latitude. Almost all green things as well as fruits were killed. There was ice, frost, and some snow flurries in July. August proved to be the worst month of all not only here but even in Europe. September started out with two weeks of pleasant weather and the rest of the month was cold. October and November were extremely cold and then December was mild. This extraordinary weather condition in 1816 had been caused by the volcanic eruption of Mt. Temboro in the Dutch East Indies, blowing 50 cubic miles of dust into the air and killing some 66,000 people. The volcanic dust clouded the skies all over the earth causing doom and gloom and the "year without a summer."</p>
			<p id="p1494">What do you think, could humans do this much damage to planet Earth's weather in a lifetime???????</p>
			<p id="p1495">I think not. Volcanoes put more CFC's into the atmosphere every day than all of mankind has already done.</p>

If you watched Al's little show but you haven't watched "The Great Global Warming Swindle" then I highly - highly recommend you watch it for perspective.</p>
			<p id="p1501">People preying on the fears of others for gain- attributing the cause of global warming on humans and to ask them to pay up (carbon footprints) is the same as a religion asking you to pay money to have your sins forgiven. It is the great global warming religion preaching fear to the masses and Al Gore is their Prophet (profit)...plain and simple.</p>

			<p id="p1503">A Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) tree-ring width chronology from Jämtland, in the central Scandinavian Mountains, built from living and sub-fossil wood, covering the period 1632 BC to AD 2002, with a minor gap during AD 887–907, is presented. This is the first multi-millennial tree-ring chronology from the central parts of Fennoscandia. Pine growth in this tree line environment is mainly limited by summer temperatures, and hence the record can be viewed as a temperature proxy. Using the regional curve standardization (RCS) technique, pine-growth variability on short and long time scales was retained and subsequently summer (June–August) temperatures were reconstructed yielding information on temperature variability during the last 3600 years. Several periods with anomalously warm or cold summers were found: 450–550 BC (warm), AD 300–400 (cold), AD 900–1000 (the Medieval Warm Period, warm) and AD 1550–1900 (Little Ice Age, cold). The coldest period was encountered in the fourth century AD and the warmest period 450 to 550 BC. However, the magnitude of these anomalies is uncertain since the replication of trees in the Jämtland record is low during those periods. The twentieth century warming does not stand out as an anomalous feature in the last 3600 years. Two multi-millennial tree-ring chronologies from Swedish and Finnish Lapland, which have previously been used as summer temperature proxies, agree well with the Jämtland record, indicating that the latter is a good proxy of local, but also regional, summer temperature variability.</p>

One degree, two degrees or more COOLER than we have now, or is a more ideal temperature to sustain human life actually WARMER than it is now?

Science has shown that climate has fluctuated in the past. Just because some arrogant people try to jam their opinion (that there is "global warming") down our throats does not make it fact. Science is not politics nor should it be in lock step with the news media and the "green" forces trying to convince us that something exists when it might not in fact be happening.</p>
			<p id="p1549">Frankly this article simply reaffirms that the Nobel organization should be noble and ask Al Gore to return the peace prize and apologize to the hundreds of millions on the planet who have endured record cold, snow, floods, and weather conditions that reflect the nearly normal ebb and flow of climate fluctuations.</p>
			<p id="p1550">If the "green" groups were truly scientific they would be in an on-going discussion about the climate and what minimal impact humans have when compared to the sun.</p>

I am waiting for one of these self-declared geniuses to claim that "global warming" is actually caused by the population increase in the last few decades. Then they will act like Hitler, Stalin, Pol Phot or Mao and begin eliminating the surplus population (the people who oppose their dictatorial mandates or refuse to think like mind numbed robots).</p>

			<p id="p1581">As Professor Gold postulated years ago, the feedback system works like this: The ice cover on the Artic melts, which means substantially more atmospheric moisture flows from the Artic to Canada, Siberia, and Greenland. This atmospheric moisture ends up as snow. The snow cover reflects more heat, cooling the atmosphere, and incidentially growing icepacks. This removes water from the ocean. As the ocean level drops, the flow of warm surface water from the remains of the Gulf Stream into the Artic near Spitzbergen diminishes, cooling the Artic Ocean, which leads to a refreezing of the ice, which reduces the snowfall, which in turn raises sea level.</p>
			<p id="p1582">Now, the whole thing may be initiated by outside forces, such as solar radiation or volcanic belching. But this feedback system moderates any changes.</p>

To bail us out, it would have to drop to 1330 W/m2—something that can pretty much be guaranteed not to happen.</p>

When you plot these over time, the warming trend does continue. Let's wait to see what next year brings. Also, instead of debating whether or not there is Global Warming...lets get rational about its cause: what can be attributed to standard cycles vs. man induced.

That year started out, in Stanley as well as other regions of the south, so mild for the months of January and February that many folks let their fires go out and burned wood only for cooking; however, March was very cold and windy. Showers started the Month of April but ended with snow and ice. In May the temperature was like that of winter. The young buds that began forming in April were stiff and frozen. Ice, one half inch thick formed on ponds and rivers in North and South Carolina. Corn was killed and after being planted again and again nothing was reaped from the cornfields. June was cold, the coldest month ever experienced in this latitude. Almost all green things as well as fruits were killed. There was ice, frost, and some snow flurries in July. August proved to be the worst month of all not only here but even in Europe. September started out with two weeks of pleasant weather and the rest of the month was cold. October and November were extremely cold and then December was mild. This extraordinary weather condition in 1816 had been caused by the volcanic eruption of Mt. Temboro in the Dutch East Indies, blowing 50 cubic miles of dust into the air and killing some 66,000 people. The volcanic dust clouded the skies all over the earth causing doom and gloom and the "year without a summer."</p>

			<p id="p1641">A comment I posted 'a long time ago in galaxy far away'..</p>
			<p id="p1642">It is time for everyone to take a step back from this counter-productive confrontation. Let us all stipulate a few facts. Over the eons planet earth has experienced significant periods of change. To the extent that man is exacerbating the current period is arguable, but let's say human activity (read economic activity) is having an undeniable effect. Agree? Good. Now let's start over.</p>
			<p id="p1643">One, we know that a better measure of human activity is not climate change, but air quality. Am I making sense so far? Now where in the world is air quality and economic growth been managed and reconciled most efficiently. Are you ready for this? Right here in Southern California. That's right folks. Anyone alive who lived here in the 1950's know that air quality, despite quantum leaps in economic growth is significantly better. Could it be better still? Of course, but Southern California and all of California has led the technological advance and we will remain in the lead. Our governor wants more leadership still. I respectfully submit that what is needed is not more leadership but more followers. Not just here in the United States, but around the world. And especially around the world in rapidly developing countries in this exploding global economy.</p>
			<p id="p1644">I know what I am talking about. And you should too. For example, are not the olympic games being threatened by bad air quality in Bejing, China? Were they threatened in Los Angeles? Yes, but not air, traffic was the worry. We handled that nicely.</p>
			<p id="p1645">Be honest and look around the globe. A California-style attack, a genuine protocol,against bad air will be the best offense over the near term (50 years) to alleviate man-made economic effects. Now if my logic is correct, will this not also address the zealous war against global warming. Of course, but perhaps not for some. Many zealots have a different agenda.</p>
			<p id="p1646">None of what I suggest precludes all the 'green' actions proposed and already underway here in the United States, but recognizes that fossil fuels will be needed over the near term to insure a peaceful expansion of the global economy. An expansion that should raise and maintain the quality of life for all humankind.</p>
			<p id="p1647">For whatever reason, climate change occurs. The seas will ebb and flow. For now, not melting ice, but rising seas need to be managed. Really folks, we actually do need more fresh water anyway. Let's deal with that. We do know how.</p>

			<p id="p1654">The scientific fact is that the NORMAL climate conditions are ALWAYS CHANGING. If the climate stopped changing, then it would be abnormal. Thinking man has an effect on the climate is frankly ethnocentric. We are insignificant and irrelevant on the cosmic scale.</p>
			<p id="p1655">The biggest consistent contributor to our ever-changing climate is the Sun (solar activity,flares, sunspots, solar wind) and interstellar cosmic rays from Gamma Ray bursts, Supernovae, and other unknown cosmic phenomena.</p>
			<p id="p1656">The rise of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, although miniscule relative to other gasses like water vapor, is not the CAUSE of warming, but the EFFECT of warming. To illustrate this it in layman's terms, bring a bottle of Coke close to the point of freezing. Open it. Very little carbon dioxide escapes (its dissolved in the water). Take another bottle and warm it to 150 degrees F. Then open it. You get a jet of water because carbon dioxide is escaping.</p>
			<p id="p1657">Large bodies of water act the same over decades or centuries, absorbing and releasing carbon dioxide in a delayed synchronization with changes in global temperature: lakes, oceans, calderas. First the temperature rises, then these bodies of water release the carbon dioxide. When global temperatures drop, carbon dioxide follows and is reabsorbed into water.</p>

			<p id="p1680">As one of the few people left in this world that wholly supports Pres. George W. Bush I am disappointed that he has bought into "global warming." It is totally evident, simply from the discussions on this page, that global warming is something we don't understand yet. There is evidence supporting many different theories. I don't know much about science but I know a lot about politics and the economy. Global warming is having a much less severe influence on our climate system than it is having on the poor people of this world. Most people in this world can't afford energy costs as it is. "Updating" to renewable energy is going to cost a lot of money. Is Al Gore going to make up the difference for that with his carbon credits he sells to himself? No, the poor people of this world that work hard just to pay the bills are going to feel the weight of that political monster. I wish "scientists" who disguise themselves as experts on television would be more interested in those people than whatever agenda they are trying to further. I am not saying that climate change isn't an item of concern, it is. Personally I believe the data that shows CO2 increases following warming (and then the water warms up and more and more CO2 is released into the atmosphere). However, that doesn't matter. Keep studying it! Just don't throw it on the shoulders of the public until we are really needing to.</p>

The rest of us rely on slightly less hysterical and emotional reasoning which is based upon data collected from the oceans, snowpacks and glaciers in/around both poles showing data from over 12,000 years that our temperature changes every 1500 years or so based upon solar activity and proximity to the sun (orbit) rather than gas guzzling chariots from the 1st century.</p>

			<p id="p1697">Mellish is pretty good, and answers the myth that “the earth has been through all this before” and that “heat island effect” is what we’re seeing OR that “there was a consensus in the 1970s” that the earth was cooling off.</p>

			<p id="p1701">There IS consensus among most meteorologists and climatologists about AGW being the proximate cause of slight warming over the past century. Mellish makes sure we understand that cyclic variations in snow or hurricane intensity and dry or cold spells in and of themselves cannot prove anything one way or another. Al Gore is just as wrong to use hot summers for his concerns in saving Mother Earth to prove something as are kids playing in snow in Madrid. One model of AGW has more water vapor in the air due to even small temps increase, thus possibly bringing about more snow until such time as those areas that are infrequently seen with snowfall (like, well, Madrid) lose snow altogether. Of course this could take a long time. decades. Or not? I distinctly remember one morning in Atlanta Georgia as a youngster in 1981 where the temperature fell to 5 below zero F. Not happened since. And most unlikely anymore.</p>
			<p id="p1702">There was NOT a consensus outside the editorial staff at Newsweek, however, that the planet was heading to an ice age in the 70s. Oopsy. I remember the claim even as I was a little tyke back then. But it was never based on "science."</p>

When you do this, you betray the fact that the GW discussion is not about science, reasoning, evidence, and deliberation but rather about promoting governmental control, funding for environmentalist programs, vilifying the West and the United States, and conducting guerilla warfare against capitalism. Leftists believe "progress," "modernity," and science led directly to the horrific warfare in the 20th century, when actually it is how many used this technology that was the problem. Irrational fervent nationalism, irrational drives to "unite" people under socialism, fascism, or communism led to the deaths of millions. Science was "hijacked" by these irrational ideologues the way terrorists hijack the Quran to kill "infidels." The point is, leftists don't respect science or reasoning per se, but they cherry-pick it as a means to their own dubious ends. Since leftists don't respect science or rational discussion, there is no reason to respect them when they attempt to commandeer science for their own radical and foolish goals. Just ignore them. It will be so sweet and lovely when these maniacs are completely discredited in a few years. By the way, there are about 100 reasons why the man-made GW craze is a hoax, but if you don't have the brains to figure it out for yourself, I'm not going to convince you here. GW fanatics have their own petty reasons for wanting to believe, and I'm not going to play Bill Nye the Science Guy and hold your hand through a conversation explaining sunspot activity, solar winds, gamma rays, Milankovitch rhythms, how sea levels are affected by melting glaciers (they aren't), or any other basic knowledge you should have learned in "environmental science" in high school.

If a new drug has no reported side effects, the FDA knows the data are fake. That is also why police question criminal suspects many different times, to check for variance. If the same story is repeated almost word for word, then it was made up.</p>
			<p id="p1757">It is not reasonable to expect that AGW explain every bit of anomalous data, or that every scientist should believe that AGW explains the data better than all others.</p>
			<p id="p1758">In fact, a belief that AGW explained everything and all scientists should believe feverently in the theory, is the tip-off that AGW has gone over the edge.</p>
			<p id="p1759">The reason that global cooling never gained traction in the media is because mankind cannot be blamed for it. But it is scary. Another extensive glaciation would mean the end of civilization as we know it. A rise in avg global temp of a degree or two over hundreds of years is not in the same ballpark. (I've lived where the temperature varies over 100F in the course of a year. In one day 30F.)</p>
			<p id="p1760">Most people like warm weather, not cold. Asking people to lower their standard of living for colder weather, which means they have to pay even more money to stay warm, really doesn't resonate with anyone.</p>

If the predictions of a theory don't match what happens, the theory is wrong, period. If AGW proponents really believed that AGW definitely predicts beyond any doubt whatsoever increased hurricane activity that would hit America, then the year 2006 showed AGW is beyond any doubt whatsoever wrong.</p>
			<p id="p1762">Scientists know there is a lot of uncertainty in AGW. I heard a talk by a UN scientist who interleaved the AGW explanations with acknowledgement of the uncertainties. That was her way of saying that she has to eat, but wants other scientists to know she isn't a complete moron.</p>

			<p id="p1768">Thank you for your article informing us that the four major global temperature tracking outlets (Hadley, NASA's GISS, UAH, RSS) have data showing that global temperatures have dropped precipitously over the past year.</p>
			<p id="p1769">I hope you will follow up by identifying the motive for the "Big Lie" - that the Sun is a steady heat source so mankind must have caused global warming. If past experience is any guide, then proponents of AGW (anthropologic global warming) will not be deterred by new data.</p>

			<p id="p1772">The 1969 Apollo Mission provided the first "hard" experimental data that would destroy the illusion that our Sun is a ball of hydrogen, heated by hydrogen fusion. The first hint of an impending calamity for the model of the Sun as a ball of hydrogen was published 1970 [1].</p>

			<p id="p1784">b.) The solar surface is 91% Hydrogen (H) and 9% Helium (He). H is the lightest of all elements. He is the next lightest element.</p>
			<p id="p1785">c.) The interior of the Sun is mostly iron (Fe), oxygen (O), nickel (Ni), silicon (Si) and sulfur (S). These same elements make up bulk material in rocky planets near the Sun and in ordinary meteorites.</p>
			<p id="p1786">d.) The core of the Sun is a neutron star. That is the energy source that lights the Sun, heats planet Earth, and generates an outpouring of solar-wind H and solar neutrinos from the surface of the Sun.</p>

			<p id="p1802">This isn't just a single-year blip. Haven't the global avg. temperatures flattened out in the past five years? Haven't major climatologists conceded this is the case, but still insist that the threat of CO2 is still there?</p>
			<p id="p1803">Isn't the sun itself is overdue for a long-term solar minimum, never mind an 11-year minimum? And were the minimum is as severe as the one 320 years ago it could pose a far greater disruption to civilization than will warmer temperatures:</p>
			<p id="p1804">As for CO2: I've collected some info on soot's very large warming role in the atmosphere &amp; its huge effect in the Arctic. Note the time span on these articles &amp; yet all the fear-mongering in the same time frame about Kilimanjaro, CO2, etc. These revelations about soot are from none other than V. Ramanathan (well renown research, head of INDOEX effort) and Jim Hansen.</p>
			<p id="p1805">Perhaps it's time to get reasonable:</p>
			<p id="p1806">I'm circumspect about the motives behind all this global fear-mongering ... if the ends justify the means, then the raft of lying about global warming suggests some very big goals promoted by the neo-liberal globalist elites that're unrelated to global warming.</p>
			<p id="p1807">Google for "Al Gore Maurice Strong." If that ain't enough to raise doubts, consider that Ken "Enron" Lay was a big backer of Kyoto b/c Enron was going to cash in BIG on the carbon trading schemes. Or that US &amp; EU steel-makers are warning that steel production is getting shifted to China b/c Kyoto cost overheads in the West encourage off-shoring CO2 emissions to China. That'd be just dandy ... except that China's emissions per unit of production are 40% higher than the WORLD AVERAGE (never mind the West's average). So by the logic of the neo-liberals that backed Kyoto, we're going to use carbon credits to encourage offshoring of production to China, hence screwing labor AND emit more CO2, BOTH.</p>
			<p id="p1808">There's something very very wrong with the neo-liberal avante-liberal leadership, they're playing with policies that I find to be either unnecessary or extreme and rhetoric that's deliberately misleading. I guess what really bugs me is that they're making it all up as they go ... at least conservatives can lay some claim to precedence, even if they're sticking with it only on principle. I'm not sure what principles Al Gore or Hillary stand for anymore except their own self interests and power.</p>

So take a prozac, crack open a beer or soda, grab your fishing pole and chill. Things in this world come and go in cycles, and the other things we can't stop anyway. So save the whales because that is a good thing that we can control. Stop cutting down the rainforest because that is good as well, and save the polar bears in the process.</p>

			<p id="p1814">UPDATE AND CAVEAT:</p>
			<p id="p1815">The website DailyTech has an article citing this blog entry as a reference, and their story got picked up by the Drudge report, resulting in a wide distribution. In the DailyTech article there is a paragraph:</p>
			<p id="p1816">“Anthony Watts compiled the results of all the sources. The total amount of cooling ranges from 0.65C up to 0.75C — a value large enough to erase nearly all the global warming recorded over the past 100 years. All in one year time. For all sources, it’s the single fastest temperature change ever recorded, either up or down.”</p>
			<p id="p1817">I wish to state for the record, that this statement is not mine: “–a value large enough to erase nearly all the global warming recorded over the past 100 years”</p>
			<p id="p1818">There has been no “erasure”. This is an anomaly with a large magnitude, and it coincides with other anecdotal weather evidence. It is curious, it is unusual, it is large, it is unexpected, but it does not “erase” anything. I suggested a correction to DailyTech and they have graciously complied.</p>
			<p id="p1819">This from the source of the graphs you used in the posting about colder temps and snow fall but I didn't the correction anywhere. You, like most deniers of climate change have cherry picked the data that fits your needs and ignore all the facts. This is not science, it's called lying to further your ideas or personal agenda. We are not fooled.</p>

			<p id="p1837">I know I'm new to this page, well really this particular site as a whole, but I have spent the past few days periodically viewing the posts here and on some other blog pages as well, but the thing that gets me is that people, scientist, politicians, etc, along with college students like myself all seem to bring up valid points concerning the weather our planet has recently and historically witnessed. That being said (and I apologize for the long drawn out sentences) I still constantly hear about this global "consensus" that just cannot exist; there is just too much data from every field flying around in a crazy flurry by people who have taken their view of the world and are playing it as an unquestionable dogma. And their supposed to be talking about science? How can there be a consensus on a topic that, until the past 100-150 years, we really couldn't even start gathering all of this data for, especially in regards to recent solar data (which in my opinion is extremely interesting and powerful). To think we have, in just one century, figured out all there is to know about a planet that has been around for billions of year (or if your church affiliated thousands) is to know that we are wrong. If science has taught us anything, it's that even if there is just one person (Galileo, Copernicus, Plato, Newton, so on) just one person with the gall to sit their rear end down, analyzing, producing and effectively reproducing charts and graphs that encompass the entirety of the situation and if that one person can sit down and PROVE beyond an inkling of a doubt the exact cause, or in this case causes (because yes each has an effect, each) whether solar, anthropogenic, natural, galactic, glacial, etc, that by doing this with an absolutely un-biased view point, an entire world can be turned on its head. The inconvenient truth, and the real swindle here is that neither side knows beyond a reasonable doubt exactly how each of these factors work hand in hand in producing the climate that we have today, much less what we will have in any time of the future. It never matters how many people say something is true, the only thing that matters is that there is one "fool" open minded enough to see past the politics to find the real answer. That is true knowledge and that is true science.</p>
			<p id="p1838">The moment science is mixed with politics, true science dies and this other breed takes it's place. There are scientists out there who do their research out of love for their field of work, and who aren't politically tainted, why aren't we getting more information about these climate affecting possibilities from scientists in each individual field, who are self funded and don't have any bit of money flowing into their pockets and research from oil companies, political parties, or special interest groups?</p>

			<p id="p1887">"Contrary to some statements flying around the internet, there is no effect on the rankings of global temperature. Also our prior analysis had 1934 as the warmest year in the U.S. (see the 2001 paper above), and it continues to be the warmest year, both before and after the correction to post 2000 temperatures. However, as we note in that paper, the 1934 and 1998 temperature are practically the same, the difference being much smaller than the uncertainty."</p>
			<p id="p1888">Third global warming is not an exact science. Not much is. As a chemist I know there are more things we do not know about chemistry than we do know. However variations in data regressions does not completely debunk my work or any science. Trends are becoming abundantly clear. CO2 levels are above any historical averages, and the temperature is increasing. Those are FACTS , they are not disputable. Whether they directly correlate to one another is what the scientists are doing.

			<p id="p1902">The point is that, on a geologic time scale, atmospheric CO2 isn't high. It's actually very low. And the paleoclimatic record also reveals a very poor correlation between CO2 and temperature, meaning higher levels don't automatically equate with a warming trend.</p>
			<p id="p1903">Recent research has shown that past estimates of CO2's forcing abilities were far overstated. Even a doubling of atmospheric CO2 is anticipated to generate only some 1 degree of total warming. Given we've already experienced over half that warming already (barring the last year's cooling pulse, of course), there certainly doesn't seem to be any reason to scream the sky is falling.</p>

			<p id="p1907">The fact remains that since the Earth and life on Earth look more or less like we know it now (&lt; 500,000 years), the CO2 has not exceeded 300 ppm. To reach the 3,000 ppm you were talking about, I guess you have to go back > 150 My for the best estimate (accounting for the most favorable error bars) to > 300 My.

			<p id="p1969">Coming back hundreds of millions of years ago, when CO2 concentration was considerably higher, is probably a great subject of research, but you will have the greatest difficulties to link your results to the present situation. That is obvious when you consider that for example parts of Africa were at the South pole and atmospheric and oceanic circulation were largely different from what occurs with the present conformation of land masses. Now if you would have a bit of knowledge about climatology, you'd already realize that drawing conclusion about today's and tomorrow's climate from such old paleoclimate is necessarily limited, especially regarding the major question of feedbacks.</p>
			<p id="p1970">Following your argument, one could analyze the Earth original atmospheres, full of hydrogen an helium, or later (until ~ 200 Myears ago by the way) with large concentration of CO2, little O2 and a very simple biosphere.

			<p id="p1995">Has the IPCC changed its tune? Has the media? NO! They still list SOOT as an unknown w/ a higher tendency toward surface dimming &amp; cooling than heat absorption. Ramanathan showed that this *IS NOT* the case, soot has a net heating effect of 1 watt/m3 (more than it cools the surface). How did Ramanathan's team discover this? They got the heck away from the computer model &amp; went and flew sorties of small robotic plains through soot-stained skies over the Indian Ocean. In other words they did EMPIRICAL RESEARCH!!!</p>
			<p id="p1996">Ramanathan &amp; his team @ the Scripps Inst. went on to show how 40% of all the warming over the vast Pacific &amp; the Western USA is DUE TO SOOT, how most of the early melts in the Rockies are due to westerly Asian soot AND how most of the ARctic &amp; tundra early melts are due to Russian oil fields &amp; S.E.

			<p id="p1997">The Asian Brown CLoud is the biggest problem we have at the moment, and if the soot emissions were curtailed the problem would clear itself w/in months, not centuries.

Come on, massive weather systems like hurricanes have a lot more to do with the climate than whether there's a downpour or a snowstorm.</p>
			<p id="p2041">It's no surprise there's no mention of the normal, if not slightly warmer winter weather in Europe. But the ice cover in the arctic ocean is also skipped. It's diminishing like it has been for the last 30+ years.</p>
			<p id="p2042">When people with no background in meteorology or physics read articles like this they should compare it to similar anti-gw articles. The only consistency is the way they are made and their agenda. A scientific article or dataset is taken, coupled with some carefully cherry picked (or made up) facts and premises made by the hack. This bastardized data is then spun into a half assed article, the only purpose of which is to undermine the effort made by scientists to understand this planet better.</p>

			<p id="p2052">Ah, the silly need to throw credentials around. How about: PhD geologist? (Purely academic, by the way -- vulcanologist, you see. Never worked for those "terrible" big oil companies. Yes, I know how you work, you bad boy, you! I could see the inquisitional gleam in your eye from a mile off.)</p>
			<p id="p2053">Man caused global warming is an utter, complete, unscientific hoax -- can I be any clearer? Or should I wash, rinse, repeat?</p>
			<p id="p2054">Your "facts" are simply nonsense (and simply non-science). You talk of statistics, so you'll be familiar with this statement: garbage in, garbage out. Which is why the dogma of global warming has never worked when actually applied to and observed in the real world (a necessary part of any working theory, but what's a little invalidation between friends?).</p>
			<p id="p2055">Thus we see the sudden need to change the label from "global warming" (which only works when a given level of solar output dictates warming -- oh, did I say such a blasphemy out loud? sorry! my bad) to the much more user-friendly "climate change." That certainly covers all the bases, doesn't it? (Though in our politically correct times, wouldn't "global temperature stabilization challenged" be even better? But I digress...)</p>
			<p id="p2056">Which means that people -- meaning those who subscribe to the climate change religion (and make no mistake, it IS a religion in the very worse sense, with unquestioning and unquestionable dogma, calls for inquisitions against we heretics, etc.) -- can assign blame to mankind for ANY change in the weather, and (most importantly) the underlying political agenda can proceed unhindered.</p>
			<p id="p2057">Most of the counter arguments to the precepts of the gospel of climate change have already been covered in the various threads here, but in my quick glance through I didn't see one point that I like to make from a geologist's standpoint: warmer is BETTER. (The article itself alludes to this.)</p>
			<p id="p2058">When the world has been warmer, it hasn't turned in the equivalent of DUNE (a good read, but unfortunately the bible, it seems, of climate changers). In fact a warmer world (and I mean even A LOT warmer) is a greener, wetter, milder, in a word, NICER world for we hairless primates.</p>
			<p id="p2059">If "greenhouse gasses" actually warmed the planet, I'd be for burning them in much larger quantities than we do at the moment. (By the way, I keep wondering how man-generated atmospheric pollutants raised the temperature of other planets in the solar system, but again I digress...)</p>
			<p id="p2060">Here's just the facts, ma'am: If the world is truly entering a cooling phase, we're in for a tough go. The result will be a harsher, more barren world, where a large percentage of the life on this planet (yes, even those wonderful fuzzy fellow travelers we love to protect) is going to struggle. Yes, even climate change religionists are going to witness and be part of some dark times, and we can only hope we'll have enough of BOTH carbon based and alternative fuels to get us through.</p>
			<p id="p2061">And just so we're clear: getting rid of humanity's carbon footprint is not going to do even the smallest thing to stop ANY form of "climate change" (pick from the following options: a) warming, b) cooling, c) neither warming or colling, d) both warming and cooling, e) all of the above).</p>

			<p id="p2064">I just want to know how long has the earth been here? Seems to me I heard that it has been here for millions of years, so being able to see a global trend would take more than one hundred years. One hundred years for our planet would be like less than five minutes in a human life, so that doesn't seem like a positive base line to tell wether or not the planet is doing somthing that it shouldn't.</p>
			<p id="p2065">We do not know what the true tempetures were prior to the mini ice age, during the Roman Empire, or even during 1000AD. So when I hear people screaming that we are all going to die from the warming trend I ask you to prove to me that the tempeture fluctuation is not part of the planetay cycle.</p>

			<p id="p2067">There are things that are being used now to give us ideas of what the temperature was like 1000's of years ago. They have taken samples from ice cores and stalagmites and can get very accurate details that climate change has been occuring for millions of years. Even climate warming. This crap about we are causing our planet to warm are bs.</p>

			<p id="p2081">The year without a summer in the Carolinas</p>
			<p id="p2082">The year 1816 was famous as "the year without a summer." That year started out, in Stanley as well as other regions of the south, so mild for the months of January and February that many folks let their fires go out and burned wood only for cooking; however, March was very cold and windy. Showers started the Month of April but ended with snow and ice. In May the temperature was like that of winter. The young buds that began forming in April were stiff and frozen. Ice, one half inch thick formed on ponds and rivers in North and South Carolina. Corn was killed and after being planted again and again nothing was reaped from the cornfields. June was cold, the coldest month ever experienced in this latitude. Almost all green things as well as fruits were killed. There was ice, frost, and some snow flurries in July. August proved to be the worst month of all not only here but even in Europe. September started out with two weeks of pleasant weather and the rest of the month was cold. October and November were extremely cold and then December was mild. This extraordinary weather condition in 1816 had been caused by the volcanic eruption of Mt. Temboro in the Dutch East Indies, blowing 50 cubic miles of dust into the air and killing some 66,000 people. The volcanic dust clouded the skies all over the earth causing doom and gloom and the "year without a summer."</p>
			<p id="p2083">What do you think, could humans do this much damage to planet Earth's weather in a lifetime???????</p>
			<p id="p2084">I think not. Volcanoes put more CFC's into the atmosphere every day than all of mankind has already done.</p>

			<p id="p2088">But I agree with you. Volcanoes dump a lot of crap into the atmosphere, have for millions of years. Thank you volcanoes!!</p>
			<p id="p2089">I wonder how much this undersea volcano eruption (22 million cubic meters) raised sea levels / temperatures... causing more polar ice melting and killing mass quantities of krill, kelp, and other CO2 converting plant life?</p>
			<p id="p2090">Probably insignificant, but that raise will be attributed to humans instead of the planet.</p>

			<p id="p2094">Maybe you won't have to hold your breath that long. If the planet cools, and we've restricted the building all forms of REAL power generation (Coal, Nuclear, Not burning your food!), your lights and heat and are going to go out daily, like living in Baghdad. As I write 3 M people in So. Florida are in the dark because one Nuclear station went off line. Do you know how long it takes to economically build back a capacity shortage? - 5-10 years.</p>
			<p id="p2095">Our problem isn't burning oil, it's running out of oil. The only way to solve that is growth, investment, invention, human ingenuity. That leads to cleaner technologies, less poverty, longer life, more opportunities for the human spirit. Global warming as a movement is about the opposite: restricting growth, suffocating progress, investing in whether Polar Bears are humping or not, and limiting human potential.</p>

			<p id="p2099">Top psychiatrist concludes liberals clinically nuts</p>
			<p id="p2100">Eminent psychiatrist makes case ideology is mental disorder</p>
			<p id="p2101">WASHINGTON – Just when liberals thought it was safe to start identifying themselves as such, an acclaimed, veteran psychiatrist is making the case that the ideology motivating them is actually a mental disorder.</p>
			<p id="p2102">"Based on strikingly irrational beliefs and emotions, modern liberals relentlessly undermine the most important principles on which our freedoms were founded," says Dr. Lyle Rossiter, author of the new book, "The Liberal Mind: The Psychological Causes of Political Madness." "Like spoiled, angry children, they rebel against the normal responsibilities of adulthood and demand that a parental government meet their needs from cradle to grave."</p>
			<p id="p2103">While political activists on the other side of the spectrum have made similar observations, Rossiter boasts professional credentials and a life virtually free of activism and links to "the vast right-wing conspiracy."</p>
			<p id="p2104">For more than 35 years he has diagnosed and treated more than 1,500 patients as a board-certified clinical psychiatrist and examined more than 2,700 civil and criminal cases as a board-certified forensic psychiatrist. He received his medical and psychiatric training at the University of Chicago.</p>
			<p id="p2105">Rossiter says the kind of liberalism being displayed by the two major candidates for the Democratic Party presidential nomination can only be understood as a psychological disorder.</p>
			<p id="p2106">A social scientist who understands human nature will not dismiss the vital roles of free choice, voluntary cooperation and moral integrity – as liberals do," he says. "A political leader who understands human nature will not ignore individual differences in talent, drive, personal appeal and work ethic, and then try to impose economic and social equality on the population – as liberals do. And a legislator who understands human nature will not create an environment of rules which over-regulates and over-taxes the nation's citizens, corrupts their character and reduces them to wards of the state – as liberals do."</p>
			<p id="p2107">Dr. Rossiter says the liberal agenda preys on weakness and feelings of inferiority in the population by:</p>
			<p id="p2108">• creating and reinforcing perceptions of victimization;</p>
			<p id="p2109">• satisfying infantile claims to entitlement, indulgence and compensation;</p>
			<p id="p2110">• augmenting primitive feelings of envy;</p>
			<p id="p2111">• rejecting the sovereignty of the individual, subordinating him to the will of the government.</p>
			<p id="p2112">"The roots of liberalism – and its associated madness – can be clearly identified by understanding how children develop from infancy to adulthood and how distorted development produces the irrational beliefs of the liberal mind," he says. "When the modern liberal mind whines about imaginary victims, rages against imaginary villains and seeks above all else to run the lives of persons competent to run their own lives, the neurosis of the liberal mind becomes painfully obvious."</p>
			<p id="p2113">This helps explain why liberals just don't get it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

			<p id="p2115">One problem with this argument is that separated-at-birth identical-twin studies (the big one in Minnesota) showed that almost all and I hedge a bit but mostly likely *all* personality traits are inherited by a factor of 50%. Psychology coined phrases such as "cycle of abuse" in which abused kids turn into abusive parents. Guess what? It's mostly inherited abusiveness! The distinction between correlation and causation escaped classic soft-science psychology.</p>
			<p id="p2116">Guess what else is influenced by 50% genetic (or embryonic conditions such as the stress or malnutrition of the mother) factors? Political affiliation!</p>
			<p id="p2117">So if you call Liberalism "madness" then you must also consider the humane fact that it is an inherited "defect". But why might such a "defect" not then be weeded out? Well, political activism is a great way for males to get female attention, and for females to get invited to high society parties full of high status wealthy males.</p>

A planet's climate is decided by its mass, its distance from the sun and the composition of its atmosphere. Mars is too small to keep a thick atmosphere. Its atmosphere consists mainly of carbon dioxide, but the atmosphere is very thin. The atmosphere of the Earth is a hundred times thicker.
Over the last 400,000 years the Earth's climate has been unstable, with very significant temperature changes, going from a warm climate to an ice age in as rapidly as a few decades. These rapid changes suggest that climate may be quite sensitive to internal or external climate forcings and feedbacks.

concentrations in the atmosphere have                 been measured at an altitude of about 4,000 meters on the peak of                 Mauna Loa mountain in Hawaii since 1958.

has increased from a pre-industrial               concentration of about 280 ppmv to about 367 ppmv at present (ppmv=               parts per million by volume).
The rich countries of the world historically has emitted most of the anthropogenic greenhouse gases since the start of the industrial revolution in the latter half of the 1700s. Per capita, the significant emissions still are produced by the OECD countries
In 1988, UNEP and WMO jointly established the Intergovernmental Panel               on Climate Change (IPCC) as concern over climate change became a political               issue. The purpose of the IPCC was to assess the state of knowledge               on the various aspects of climate change including science, environmental               and socio-economic impacts and response strategies.
The potential impacts of climate change on the environment and socio-economic               systems can be understood in terms of sensitivity, adaptability and               vulnerability of the system.

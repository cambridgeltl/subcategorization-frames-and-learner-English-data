Question 1
What can scientific, technical, and socio-economic                analyses contribute to the determination of what constitutes dangerous                anthropogenic interference with the climate system as referred to                in Article 2 of the Framework Convention on Climate Change?
Framework Convention on Climate              Change, Article 2
"The ultimate objective of this Convention and any related legal              instruments that the Conference of the Parties may adopt is to achieve,              in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Convention, stabilization              of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that              would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate              system. Such a level should be achieved within a time-frame sufficient              to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure              that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development              to proceed in a sustainable manner."
1.1
Natural, technical, and social sciences can provide          essential information and evidence needed for decisions on what constitutes          "dangerous anthropogenic interference" with the climate system. At the          same time, such decisions are value judgments determined through socio-political          processes, taking into account considerations such as development, equity,          and sustainability, as well as uncertainties and risk. Scientific          evidence helps to reduce uncertainty and increase knowledge, and can serve          as an input for considering precautionary measures.
1.2
The basis for determining what constitutes "dangerous            anthropogenic interference" will vary among regions, depending both            on the local nature and consequences of climate change impacts, and            also on the adaptive capacity available to cope with climate change.            It also depends upon mitigative capacity, since the magnitude and the            rate of change are both important. The consequent types of adaptation            responses that will be selected depend on the effectiveness of various            adaptation or mitigation responses in reducing vulnerabilities and improving            the sustainability of life-support systems. There is no universally            applicable best set of policies; rather, it is important to consider            both the robustness of different policy measures against a range of possible future worlds, and the degree to which such climate-specific            policies can be integrated with broader sustainable development policies.
1.3
The Third Assessment Report (TAR) provides an assessment          of new scientific information and evidence as an input for policy makers          in their determination of what constitutes "dangerous anthropogenic interference          with the climate system" with regard to: (1) the magnitudes and rates          of changes in the climate system, (2) the ecological and socio-economic          impacts of climate change, and (3) the potential for achieving a broad          range of levels of concentrations through mitigation and information about          how adaptation can reduce vulnerability.
With regard to the magnitudes and rates of changes in          the climate system, the TAR provides scenario-based projections of future          concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, global and regional          patterns of changes and rates of change in temperature, precipitation,          and sea level, and changes in extreme climate events. It also examines          possibilities for abrupt and irreversible changes in ocean circulation          and the major ice sheets.
Risks to unique and threatened systems
Risks associated with extreme weather events
The distribution of impacts
Risks of large-scale, high-impact events.
Of great significance here is an assessment of the likelihood of the          critical thresholds at which natural and human systems exhibit large-scale,          abrupt, or irreversible changes in their response to a changing climate.          Since no single indicator (e. g., a monetary unit) captures the range          of relevant risks presented by climate change, a variety of analytical          approaches and criteria are required to assess impacts and facilitate          decisions about risk management.

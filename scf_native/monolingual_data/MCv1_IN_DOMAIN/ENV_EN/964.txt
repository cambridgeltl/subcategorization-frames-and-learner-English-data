Future              projections by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
According              to a report by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC),              30% of animal and plant species will be vulnerable to extinction if              global temperatures rose by 1.5 to 2.5 degrees Celsius. It says the              world’s have-nots would be worst hit by climate change, predicting              greenhouse gases would change rainfall patterns, intensify tropical              storms, accelerate the melting of Arctic ice and mountain glaciers,              and amplify the risk of drought, flooding and water stress.
IPCC              holds that Asia faces a heightened risk of flooding, severe water              shortages, infectious disease and hunger from global warming this              century. The region is confronted by a 90% likelihood that more than              a billion of its people will be “adversely affected” by              the impacts of global warming by the 2050s.
Its              estimates say the magnitude of climate-change effects will vary according              to the size of the world’s population, energy use and the level              of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. But under any scenario, the              world’s most populous region will be badly hit.
Statements              on Global Warming by IPCC ( New York Times)
IPCC              notes that using the term “very likely” indicates a likelihood              of more than 90%. This is how the the statements about the evidence              have evolved and become stronger.
1990
The                        unequivocal detection of the enhanced greenhouse effect                        from observations is not likely for a decade                        or more
1995
2001
There                        is new and stronger evidence  that most                        of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable                        to human activities.
2007
th
century is very likely due                        to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas                        concentrations.
Sector-wise              findings from the 4th Assessment Report regarding projected impacts              as well as vulnerability and adaptation
Growing              water demand and climate change
120 million to 1.2 billion people in Asia will experience increased              water stress by 2020 and 185 to 981 million by 2050.
Per capita water availability              in India will drop from around 1900 cubic metre currently to 1,000              cu-metres by 2025.
By mid-century, annual average              river runoff and water availability are projected to increase by 10-40%              at high latitudes and in some wet tropical areas, and decrease by              10-30% over some dry regions at mid-latitudes and in the dry tropics,              some of which are presently water stressed areas.
In the course of the century,              water supplies stored in glaciers and snow cover are projected to              decline, reducing water availability in regions supplied by meltwater              from major mountain ranges, where more than one-sixth of the world              population currently lives.
Adaptation procedures and risk management practices for the water              sector are being developed in some countries and regions that have              recognized projected hydrological changes with related uncertainities.
Vulnerability              of Indian agriculture to climate change
Cereal yields in South Asia could drop in some areas by up to 30%              by 2050.
Crop productivity is projected              to increase slightly at mid-to high latitudes for local mean temperature              increases of up to 1-3 degrees Celcius depending on the crop, and              then decrease beyond that in some regions.
At lower latitudes, especially              seasonally dry and tropical regions, crop productivity is projected              to decrease for even small local temperature increases (1-2 degrees              Celsius), which would increase risk of hunger.
Globally, the potential              for food production is projected to increase with increases in local              average temperature over a range of 1-3 degrees Celsius, but above              this it is projected to decrease.
Increases in the frequency              of droughts and floods are projected to affect local crop production              negatively, especially in subsistence sectors at low latitudes.
Coastal              hazards due to climate change
Even modest rises in sea levels will cause flooding and economic disruption              in densly-populated mega-deltas, such as the mouths of the Yangtze              in China, the Red River in China and Vietnam, and the Ganges-Brahmaputra              delta in low-lying Bangladesh.
Coasts are projected to              be exposed to increasing risks, including coastal erosion, due to              climate change and sea-level rise. The effect will be exacerbated              by increasing human-induced pressures on coastal areas.
Many millions more people              are projected to be flooded every year due to sea level rise by the              2080s. Those densly populated and low-lying areas where adaptive capacity              is relatively low, and which already face other challenges such as              tropical storms or local coastal subsidence, are especially at risk.              The numbers affected will be largest in the mega-deltas of Asia and              Africa while small islands are especially vulnerable.
Adaptation for coasts will              be more challenging in developing countries than in developed countries,              due to constraints on adaptive capacity.
The most vulnerable industries, settlements and societies are generally              those in coastal and river flood plains, those whose economies are              closely linked with climate-sensitive resources, and those in areas              prone to extreme weather events, especially where rapid urbanization              is occurring. Poor communities can be especially vulnerable, in particular              those concentrated in high-risk areas. They tend to have more limited              adaptive capacities, and are more dependent on climate-sensitive resources              such as local water and food supplies.
Interlinkages              with health
Projected climate change-related exposures are likely to affect the              health status of millions of people, particularly those with low adaptive              capacity, through
a. increases in malnutrition and consequent disorders, with implications              for child growth and development;
b. increased deaths, disease and injury due to heat waves, floods,              storms, fires and droughts;
c. the increased burden of diarrhoeal disease;
d. the increased frequency of cardio-respiratory diseases due to higher              concentrations of ground level ozone related to climate change; and,
e. the altered spatial distribution of some infectious disease vectors.
Cholera and malaria could              increase due to flooding and a wider habitat range for mosquitoes.
Climate change is expected              to have some mixed effects, such as the decrease or increase of the              range and transmission potential of malaria in Africa.
Studies in temperate areas(mainly              in industrialized countries) have shown that climate change is projected              to bring some benefits, such as fewer deaths from cold exposure. Overall              it is expected that these benefits will be outweighed by the negative              health effects of rising temperatures world-wide, especially in developing              countries.
Impact              on ecosystem structure and function
The resilience of many ecosystems is likely to be exceeded this century              by an unprecedented combination of climate change, associated disturbances              (e.g., flooding, drought, wildfire, insects, ocean acidification),              and other global drivers(e.g., land use change, pollution, over-exploitation              of resources).
Some 30 per cent of Asian              coral reefs, which sustain a large percentage of marine life, are              expected to be lost in the next 30 years, although this will occur as a result of multiple stresses.
Over the course of this              century, net carbon uptake by terrestrial ecosystems is likely to              peak before mid-century and then weaken or even reverse, thus amplifying              climate change.
Approximately 20-30% of              plant and animal species assessed so far are likely to be at increased              risk of extinction if increases in global average temperature exceed              1.5-2.5 degrees Celsius.
The progressive acidification              of oceans due to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide is expected              to have negative impacts on marine shell forming organisms (e.g.,corals)              and their dependent species.
Regional changes in the              distribution and production of particular fish species are expected              due to continued warming, with adverse effects projected for aquaculture              and fisheries.
Corals are vulnerable to              thermal stress and have low adaptive capacity. Increases in sea surface              temperature of about 1-3 degrees Celsius are projected to result in              more frequent coral bleaching events and widespread mortality, unless              there is thermal adaptation or acclimatization by corals.
Coastal wetlands including              salt marshes and mangroves are projected to be negatively affected              by sea-level rise especially where they are constrained on their landward              side, or starved of sediment.
Extreme              events in terms of intensity and frequency
In the Himalayas, glaciers less than four kilometers long will disappear              entirely if average global temperatures rise by 3 degrees Celsius.              This will initially cause increased flooding and mudslides followed              by an eventual decrease in flow in rivers that are glacier-fed.
Drought-affected areas will              likely increase in extent. Heavy precipitation events, which are very              likely to increase in frequency, will augment flood risk.
While extreme weather events become more intense and more frequent,              the economic and social costs of those events will increase, and these              increases will be substantial in the areas most directly affected.              Climate change impacts spread from directly impacted areas and sectors              to other areas and sectors through extensive and complex linkages.

Delegates meeting at the U.N. climate conference in Bali agreed to include forest conservation in future discussions on a new global warming treaty, reports the Associated Press.  The move could lead to the transfer of billions of dollars — in the form of carbon credits — from industrialized countries to tropical nations for the purpose of slowing greenhouse gas emissions by reducing deforestation rates.  Deforestation presently accounts for roughly 20 percent of anthropogenic emissions worldwide.
While controversial, the program, known as Reducing Emissions From Deforestation and Degradation (REDD), has been widely seen by scientists and environmentalists as a way to address environmental degradation by assigning value to intact ecosystems like rainforests and peat swamps.
"[REDD has] the potential to shift the balance of underlying economic market forces that currently favor deforestation, by raising billions of dollars for the ecosystem services provided by rainforest regions," wrote a team of scientists in a paper published in Science  last month.
COMMENTARY FROM THE BALI TALKS:
Gabriel Thoumi, Erb Institute for Global Sustainable Enterprise
In Bali, we saw the global ability to communicate effectively across all four sectors of society - government, NGOs/communities, business leaders, and scientists - strained because the language of our rhetoric is not effective. Effective definitionally suggests that we are able to state a position, debate its merits, pursue critical thinking mechanistically, and arrive at an improved solution that benefits greater society. This is "rhetorical optimization".
In Bali, we saw the US delegation deliberately shame African delegates during the plenary. We saw the US delegation sneak in last minute language that would have eliminated all binding targets. We saw other delegations act in similar fashions. And to what end?
Clearly, our rhetorical understanding of how to approach climate discussions has focused on an elementary binary decision tree where either "I win, you lose" or "I lose, you win". This has been the US position for quite some time and led one esteemed delegate to describe this US administration as "the most fact averse in US history".
So even with partial success in Bali, I am not celebrating because the rhetoric around climate change hasn't changed. The developing nations want to be paid to protect their forests and the developed nations want the developing nations to curb their emissions growth. It is a no-win situation globally because there is a distinct lack of accountability. There are no statutory emissions targets.
Rome continues to burn while we, the leaders in this debate, sit and debate whether to put the fire out with tonic water or club soda.
I am gently suggesting that our rhetoric around climate change optimize to exhibit generativeness and a will to develop solutions together.
REDD may have passed but we have no binding emissions limits. Thank you George Bush for your infinite wisdom.
Researchers, together with the UK government's 2005 Stern Review, say that forest protection could be one of the most cost-effective ways to address climate change.
"Conserving tropical forests could ultimately be one of the cheapest ways we have available to slow global warming," said Dr. William Laurance, a biologist with the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute who has co-authored several papers on REDD. "The costs of forest conservation are modest and deforestation is a massive source of emissions, so slowing deforestation is like plucking the low-hanging fruit — there's a lot of benefit for not a lot of cost. And of course we're not just storing carbon; we're also saving the world's most biologically important real estate, providing a place for local and indigenous peoples, and helping to stabilize delicate soils and reduce catastrophic flooding."
Delegates at Bali apparently agreed, recommending that efforts to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation should be "strengthened and supported" but stopping short of calling for anything other than voluntary action on REDD.
REDD still faces many challenges, especially in implementation. Issues range from "permanence" (whether a county can ensure that forest carbon savings are permanent) to "leakage" (what happens when carbon conservation in one area drives deforestation in another?) to baseline data establishment (how does one measure historic deforestation to establish a baseline for calculating reduction?). Further questions over land rights (will REDD trigger a land rush by industrial agriculture giants and forestry firms?) as well as how local communities will benefit (the cost of registering and establishing a REDD project may top $50,000, a nearly insurmountable sum for communities and small-scale forest holders in some of the world's poorest countries) are also valid.  There is also ongoing squabbling between a coalition of forest nations and Brazil, which sees REDD as an attempt to limit its economic development of the Amazon rainforest.  Some forest-rich countries that have low deforestation rates have expressed concern they will be left out of the process since their forests are not under immediate threat.
Despite these concerns, it appears likely the REDD initiatives will move forward.  Last week nine industrialized governments announced plans to put US$165 million (114 million) toward the World Bank's newly created Forest Carbon Partnership Facility, a scheme that will offer tropical countries carbon offset credits to preserve forests.  The U.S. did not pledge any funds but some 30 tropical countries in Africa, Latin America and the Asia-Pacific stood to benefit from what the World Bank called "the first financial mechanism to pay countries for saving their tropical forests."  In the spirit of the progress on REDD, Governors from the Brazilian state of Amazonas and the Indonesian provinces of Aceh, Papua and West Papua agreed to a moratorium on logging until the carbon values of their forest lands is assessed.

(12/8/2007) Three governors have signed the Forests Now Declaration to protect tropical forests for their carbon value. The Governors, Irwandi Yusuf (Aceh, Indonesia), Barnabas Suebu (Papua, Indonesia), and Eduardo Braga (Amazonas, Brazil), agreed to the declaration's action plan which calls for compensation for reduced greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and protection of standing forests. Deforestation and forest degradation account for roughly 20 percent of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, but steps to reduce forest loss will help mitigate climate change.  The UK government's 2005 Stern Review said that forest protection could be one of the most cost-effective ways to address climate change.
(12/6/2007) Merrill Lynch is working with Carbon Conservation, an ecosystem services firms, to explore opportunities in avoided deforestation and integrated sustainable land management.  The partnership was announced Thursday in Bali, Indonesia, where more than 10,000 policymakers, scientists, and activists are meeting to discuss a post-Kyoto framework on limiting climate change.
(12/4/2007) The Amazon rainforest could play a major part in reducing greenhouse gas emissions that result from deforestation, reports a new study published by scientists at the Woods Hole Research Center, the Instituto de Pesquisa Ambiental da Amazônia, and the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais.  At a carbon price of $3 per ton, protecting the Amazon for its carbon value could outweigh the opportunity costs of forgoing logging, cattle ranching, and soy expansion in the region.  2008 certified emission-reduction credits for carbon currently trade at more than $90 per ton ($25 per ton of CO2).
(12/4/2007) A proposal to pay the Democratic of Congo (DRC) for reducing deforestation could add 15-50 percent to the amount of international aid given to the warn-torn country, reports a new study published by scientists at the Woods Hole Research Center (WHRC).  The funds would help alleviate rural poverty while cutting emissions of greenhouse gases and protecting threatened biodiversity.
(11/29/2007) The global carbon market could play a key role in saving the Amazon from the effects of climate change and economic development, which could otherwise trigger dramatic ecological changes, reports a new paper published in Science. The authors argue that a well-articulated plan, financed by carbon markets, could prevent the worst outcomes for the Amazon forest while generating economic benefits for the region's inhabitants.
(11/27/2007) While environmentalists, scientists, development exports, and policymakers across the political spectrum are ethusiastic about the idea of offsetting carbon emissions by preventing deforestation (a concept known as "avoided deforestation" or Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD)), the concept still faces many challenges, especially in implementation.
(11/21/2007) Conversion of forests and peatlands for agriculture in Indonesia has generated little economic benefit while releasing substantial amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, reports a new study from the the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF), the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) and their Indonesian partners.
(10/17/2007) After a steep drop in deforestation rates since 2004, widespread fires in the Brazilian Amazon (September and October 2007) suggest that forest clearing may increase this year.  All told, since 2000 Brazil has lost more than 60,000 square miles (150,000 square kilometers) of rainforest -- an area larger than the state of Georgia or the country of Bangladesh.  Most of this destruction has been driven by clearing for cattle pasture and agriculture, often in association with infrastructure development and improvements.  Higher commodity prices, especially for beef and soy, have further spurred forest conversion in the region. While drivers of Amazon deforestation are stronger than ever, mounting concerns over climate change and the effort to reign in greenhouse gas emissions may provide new economic incentives for landowners to preserve forest lands through a concept known as "avoided deforestation".
(9/18/2007) Carbon credits through forest conservation will play an important role in Aceh's recovery from decades of civil war and the devastating 2004 tsunami, which left more than 167,000 people dead and 500,000 homeless in the Indonesia province, said Aceh governor Irwandi Jusuf in meeting in San Francisco.

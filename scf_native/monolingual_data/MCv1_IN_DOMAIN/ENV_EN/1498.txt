2.5.2.1 Background and Outline of Post-SRES Analysis
The review of general mitigation scenarios shows that mitigation scenarios    and policies are strongly related to their baselines, and that there has been    no systematic comparison of the relationship between baseline and mitigation    scenarios. Modellers participating in the SRES process recognized the need to    analyze and compare mitigation scenarios using as their baselines the new IPCC    scenarios, which quantify a wide range of future worlds. Consequently, they    participated (on a voluntary basis) in a special comparison programme to quantify    SRES-based mitigation scenarios (Morita et al. , 2000a; 2000b). These SRES-based    scenarios are called Post-SRES Mitigation Scenarios.
The process of the post-SRES analysis was started by a public invitation to    modellers. A Call for Scenarios was sent to more than one hundred    researchers in March 1999 by the Co-ordinating Lead Authors of this chapter    and the SRES to facilitate an assessment of the potential implications of mitigation    scenarios based on the SRES cases, which report was developed in support of    the Third Assessment Report. Modellers from around the world were invited to    prepare quantified stabilization scenarios for two or more concentrations of    atmospheric CO
2
, based on one or more of the six SRES scenarios.    Concentration ceilings include 450, 550 (minimum requirement), 650, and 750ppmv,    and harmonization with the SRES scenarios was required by tuning reference cases    to SRES values for GDP, population, and final energy demand.
Nine modelling teams participated in the comparison programme, including six    SRES modelling teams and three other teams: AIM team (Jiang et al. , 2000), ASF    team (Sankovski et al. , 2000), IMAGE team, LDNE team (Yamaji et al. , 2000),    MESSAGE-MACRO team (Riahi & Roehrl, 2000), MARIA team (Mori, 2000), MiniCAM    team (Pitcher, 2000), PETRO team (Kverndokk et al. , 2000) and WorldScan team    (Bollen et al. , 2000). Table 2.6 shows all the modelling    teams and the stabilized concentration levels which were adopted as stabilization    targets by each one. Most of the modelling teams covered more than two SRES    baseline scenarios, and half of them developed multiple stabilization cases    for at least one baseline, so that a systematic review can be conducted to clarify    the relationship between baseline scenarios and mitigation policies and/or technologies.
While all baselines were analyzed, the A1B baseline was most frequently used.    Across baselines, the stabilization target of 550ppmv seemed to be the most    popular. Because of time constraints involved in quantifying the stabilization    scenarios, the modelling teams mostly focused their analyses on energy-related    CO
2
emissions. However, about half of the modelling teams, notably    the AIM, IMAGE, MARIA, and MiniCAM teams, have quantified mitigation scenarios    in non-energy CO

concentration stabilization    for each post-SRES mitigation scenario, a special generator (Matsuoka,    2000) was used by the modelling teams to convert the CO

concentration trajectories. In addition, the generator was    used by them to estimate the eventual level of atmospheric CO
2

emissions trajectories from    the scenarios. This generator is based on the Bern Carbon Cycle Model (Joos et al. , 1996), which was used in the IPCC SAR (IPCC, 1996) and TAR (IPCC, 2001).    Using this generator, each modelling team adjusted their mitigation scenarios    so that the interpolated CO
2
concentration reached one of the alternative    fixed target levels at the year 2150 within a 5% error. The year 2150 was selected    based on Enting et al.  (1994) who gave a basis for stabilization scenarios of    the IPCC SAR (IPCC, 1996).
A further constraint imposed was that the interpolated emission curve should    be smooth after 2100, the end of the time-horizon of the scenarios. This adjustment    played an important role in the post-SRES analyses for harmonizing emissions    concentrations levels across the stabilization scenarios. The key driving forces    of emissions such as population, GDP, and final energy consumption were harmonized    in baseline assumptions specified by the six SRES scenarios.

2.5.2.2 Storylines of Post-SRES Mitigation Scenarios
The procedure for creating post-SRES mitigation scenarios was similar to the    SRES process, even though the period for the post-SRES work was much shorter    than that for the SRES and, in contrast to the SRES process, the exercise was    voluntary and not mandated by the IPCC. The storyline approach of SRES indicates    that different future worlds will have different mitigative capacities (cf. Section 1.5.1 ). Hence, the first step of the post-SRES    scenario work was to create storylines for the mitigation scenarios.
In general, mitigation scenarios are defined relative to a baseline scenario.    If mitigation strategies are formulated and implemented in any of the future    worlds as described within SRES, a variety of aspects of that world will determine    the capacity to formulate and implement carbon reduction policies, for instance:
The availability and dissemination of relevant knowledge on emissions and      climate change;
The institutional, legal, and financial infrastructure to implement mitigation      policies and measures;
Entrepreneurial and/or governmental policies for generating innovation      and encouraging the penetration of new technologies; and
The mechanisms by which consumers and entrepreneurs respond to changing      prices and new products and processes.
In the post-SRES process, it was difficult for the modelling teams to consider    all of these aspects with relation to the SRES future worlds, because of their    inherent complexity and the amount of time available for the work. However,    some aspects were considered by some modelling teams and these were reflected    in the quantification assumptions. The rest of this section illustrates these    major points in the form of storylines for each of the six SRES scenarios, which    describe the relationship between the kind of future world on the one hand and    the capacity for mitigation on the other.
The A1 world is well equipped to formulate and implement mitigation strategies    in view of its high-tech, high-growth orientation and its willingness to co-operate    at a global scale, provided the major actors acknowledge the need for mitigation.    There will be good monitoring and reporting on emissions and climate change,    and possible signs of climate change will be detected early and become part    of the international agenda. Market-oriented policies and measures will be the    preferred response. Least-cost options will be searched for and implemented    through international negotiation and mechanisms with the support of governments    and multinational companies. New emission reduction technologies from developed    countries will enable developing countries to respond more rapidly and effectively    if barriers to technology transfer can be overcome. In this high-growth world,    the economic costs associated with the response to climate change are likely    to be bearable. In the A1B scenario, where mitigation strategies may hit the    limits of renewable energy supply, and in the A1FI scenario, carbon removal    and storage as well as higher end-use energy efficiency will become major emission    reduction options. In the A1T scenario, technology developments are such that    mitigation policies and measures only require limited additional efforts.
Developing and implementing climate change mitigation measures and policies    in the A2 world can be quite complicated. This is a result of several features    embedded in the scenario storyline: rapid population growth, relatively slow    GDP per capita growth, slow technological progress, and a regional and partially    isolationist approach in national and international politics. Because    of all these serious challenges, the abatement of GHG emissions in the A2 world    becomes plausible only in the situation when the negative effects of climate    change become imminent and the associated losses outweigh the costs    of mitigation. The same features that make the A2 world non-receptive    to worldwide mitigation policies may exacerbate the climate change effects and    prompt nations to act. Measures such as a rapid shift towards high-tech renewable    energy or deep-sea carbon storage will be highly improbable in the A2 world    as a consequence of technology limitations. Instead, such relatively low-tech    measures as limiting energy consumption, and capturing and using methane from    natural gas systems, coal mining, and landfills better fit the A2 worlds    economic and technological profile. The lack of global co-operation may cause    rather large regional variations in the feasibility and cost of mitigation policies    and measures.
The B1 world is also well equipped to formulate and implement mitigation strategies,    in view of its high economic growth and willingness to co-operate at a global    scale. In comparison with the A1 world, however, it will be confronted with    higher marginal abatement costs, although total costs are much lower than in    A1B or A1FI. This is because baseline carbon emissions are lower in the B1 world    compared to the A1 world, a consequence of the emphasis on sustainable development    in B1. There will be intense monitoring and reporting of emissions and climate    change. The precautionary principle informs international agenda setting and    policy formulation, with governments taking responsibility for climate change-related    preventive and adaptive action. Tightening international standards generates    incentives for further innovation towards energy-efficiency and low- and zero-carbon    options. Educational campaigns are another important instrument. Developed regions    support the less developed regions in a variety of ways, including transfer    of energy-efficiency and renewable-energy related technologies. Carbon taxes    are introduced; an elaborate phase-in mechanism for less developed regions is    negotiated and implemented. A part of the carbon tax revenue is used to compensate    some fossil-fuel exporters and for a fund to compensate those affected by climate    change.
In the B2 scenario actions to reduce GHG emissions are taken mainly at a local    or regional scale in response to climate change impacts. Environmentally aware    citizens of the B2 world will increasingly attribute damages to human-induced    climate change. High-income countries, which are generally less vulnerable to    climate change impacts, will increasingly see the need for climate policy action    as a consequence of cost-benefit analyses. With increasing costs of damage,    counter-measures challenge existing energy sector policies and institutional    frameworks. Generally high educational levels promote both development and environmental    protection. Resource availability, economic development, and technical change    are uneven over regions. In relative terms, R&D expenditures are expected    to stay constant, but they will be more targeted towards cleaner and less carbon-intensive    energy technologies. Existing bilateral trade links will foster bilateral technology    transfer from OECD countries to some developing countries. This is because rapidly    increasing energy and, in particular, electricity demand in developing countries    present business opportunities no longer available in OECD countries. Therefore,    there exist a number of incentives for bilateral environmental policy co-operation    between R&D intensive countries in the North and developing countries of    the South. Energy trade links, first for oil and later for natural gas and methanol,    will play an important seed role for new environmental bilateral co-operation,    leading to a regionally heterogeneous approach to GHG reduction.

THE NATURE OF THE TRADE UNION MOVEMENT
2.1 From their early beginings back in the 1600s one thing is very clear - for a worker to join a trade union means having to recognise, to some degree, that he or she has different interests from the boss.
There is no way to explain the survival of the unions other than the reality that there are different class interests, and workers have understood that to promote their own interests they have to organise on class lines.
No amount of conservatism, bureaucracy or backwardness within the unions can obliterate this essential fact.
In recent years the nature of work has, for many people, changed considerably with the growth of contract work, working from home etc.
Nevertheless, by joining a union people recognise a class interest (us v. them). While this may be different from a class consciousness (which implies a recognition of collective interests, not just an individual against the bosses), the dynamic of belonging to a collective organisation leads to the creation of some level of basic class consciousness.
2.2 Trade unions are not revolutionary organisations.
They were formed to defend and improve the lot of workers under capitalism.
Trade union struggle is an absolute necessity.
In the course of these struggles workers begin to see their potential power, they can be radicalised and can be brought into the revolutionary movement.
At times there will be low levels of struggle - whether due to a lack of confidence or to the temporary dominance of 'national interest'/'social partnership' ideas - but the contradiction between bosses' interests and workers' interests will inevitably lead to a return to higher levels of struggle and grassroots organisation.
2.4 Central to our politics is the position that the working class will lead the fight for anarchism.
It is only the self-activity of masses of workers that is capable of mounting an effective challenge to the bosses and their state.
The trade union movement is the most important mass movement the working class has built and no matter how progressive or reactionary the attitudes of its members, no matter how conservative they can become, it does not alter the fact that they are the most important mass organisations of the working class.
For the WSM, as anarchists, activity within them is an extremely important ongoing activity.
They see their union work as a career.
More than a few of them change sides and take jobs with the employers' organisations.
Their career is that of an arbitrator, a fixer, a concilliator, a negotiator.
3.2 What is important to them is proving their skills as smart negotiators, not pulling out all the stops to win their members' demands.
They have narrow sectional interests, they only look after their own patch regardless of the general intertests of workers.
These people rarely lead or initiate strikes.
Instead they will have you running back and forth to the Labour Relations Commission, Labour Court, Rights Commissioners, the Employer-Labour Conference and every other talking shop they can find.
They will negotiate "until the cows come home", and it is all aimed at finding a "reasonable" solution.
They see striking as very much a last resort, and condemn - without hesitation - unofficial action (i.e.
action that has not been sanctioned by them).
3.6 As a whole, the bureaucracy swings between the position of mediator and that of open defender of the status quo.
But as a grouping they can not go over completely to defending the bosses' interests; to some degree they have to respond to their members' demands because they are working in workers' organisations.
This is not to imply that all- or even most - trade union officials would necessarily go over to defending the bosses' interests if they could, but the nature of the position inevitably means that they cannot become totally responsive to their members' demands as that would see the end of their role, power and careers.
There are individual exceptions to this but, as a collective grouping, this remains the case.
7.2 We encourage 100% union membership and all WSM members are members of their appropriate trade union.
When members take up employment in non-union jobs, they are expected to join an appropriate trade union.
However, depending on the circumstances, it may be necessary for some considerable time for this person to remain a secret/ "sleeper" member.
The process of unionisation of non-union workplaces is extremely varied and complex.
In some cases an immediate organising drive can unionise a workplace, in others it is only when a specific issue arises that workers begin to become receptive to unionisation, in yet others it will be the product of slow and undramatic work aimed at convincing people in ones and twos.
The WSM members on a particular job are best placed to decide what strategy is most useful in their workplace.
"
(f) Opposition to 'natural wastage' of jobs, forced early retirement.
(i) For trade union support for the demands of the unemployed, e.g.
providing facilities, refusing to cut off services such as electricity and gas, etc.
(a) Opposition to all laws restricting the right to strike, and all laws which seek to interfere in the internal affairs of the unions.
Opposition to "union bashing".
For the scrapping of the anti-union provisions of the Industrial Relations Act.
(f) All strikes to be automatically made official as long as they do not contradict trade union principles.
(g) Support for all disputes, official or unofficial, in pursuit of higher wages, better conditions, jobs, trade union principles or any issue in the interest of the class.
10.1 When we say we are in favour of 100% trade unionism we mean just that.
A fighting union will gain the support of the vast majority of workers.
But there will be that small minority, from whose ranks hardline parasites and scabs appear, who will refuse to join.
As they automatically benefit from every claim the union wins they should not be allowed to opt out of the struggle for it.
Where the majority of the workforce decide they want a closed shop agreement we support them.
However we do not support single union agreements that are forced on workers from above.
The important thing is that everyone is in a bona-fide union, it is less important which union they join.
11.1 Trade unions will not become revolutionary organisations, they were never set up to be that.
However from within trade union struggle will arise the embryo of the workers' councils of the future.
The early beginnings of this are seen wherever workers create their own rank & file organisation (without mediation or "all-knowing" leaders) to pursue their class interests.

Following much political unrest (conflict with Eritrea, severe famine), a military rebellion made a coup d'état in 1974, and Lieutenant Colonel Mengistu Haile Mariam became the head of state.
The constitution was suspended and the parliament was dissolved.
The monarchy was replaced by a Provisional Military Administrative Council, called the Dergue, which soon diverted from its announced socialist cause.
The re-orientation of the government and national economy from capitalism to Marxism led to the Mengistu's military dictatorship until its fall in 1991.
In addition to the suppression of personal liberties, this regime aggravated the economy and domestic difficulties (ethnic tensions, droughts and famine, widespread flights to Djibouti, Somalia and Sudan).
In 1987, a new Marxist-based constitution was approved.
With the fall of Communism and Soviet support, a coalition of rebel organizations led by Meles Zenawi, was able to conduct a revolution in 1991.
The transitional government of Meles Zenawi sought to stabilize and strengthen Ethiopia, although certain human rights abuses continued (imprisonment of political opponents, journalists and trade union leaders).
Among these fundamental rights, a whole range of general principles of labour rights are firmly anchored in the constitution.
The constitution provides for principles such as the right of the security of the person (Article 16 of the Constitution), the prohibition against inhuman treatment and the abolishment of slavery and servitude (Article 18 (2)) and forced and compulsory labour (Article 18 (3) and (4) of the Constitution).
General Freedom of Association is laid down in the Constitution (Article 31, “for any cause or purpose”), and specified in Article 42, “Rights of Labour”, which reads: “Factory and service sector employees, peasants, agricultural workers, other rural workers, government employees below a certain level of responsibility and the nature of whose employment so requires, shall have the right to form associations for the purpose of improving their economic and employment conditions.
This right shall include the right to form trade union and other associations, and to negotiate with their employers and other organizations affecting their interests”.
The Right to Strike is explicitly mentioned in Article 42 (1) b) of the Constitution.
This article, in its paragraph 2, also lays down the right to reasonable limitation of working hours, to rest, to paid leave and to healthy and safe working environment.
The evolution of Labour Law in Ethiopia
Talking about Labour Law in Ethiopia means to basically review the history of the last 40-50 years.
Present-day labour law, as a specialized law designed to protect employees' welfare, only came into existence as a result of the modern industrial development and with the rise of the status of the employee as wage earner.
Ethiopia's process of modernization and industrialization – in contrast with other African countries with a history of colonization - continued slowly but surely since the times of Menelik II ( emperor of Ethiopia from 1889–1913) , and was only interrupted by the Italian invasion in 1935 and the following tumults of World War II.
Nevertheless, only the post war years allowed the further development of individual and social rights in line with the attempt to economical development.
At the very beginning, the workers' movement in Ethiopia was rather corporative, taking the form of the traditional Ethiopian organizations, such as “ekub” and “edir”, local self-help societies that provide services and mutual aid and protection of the interest of their members.
One of the first workers' organization with the pattern of a modern trade union was the “Franco-Ethiopian Railway Company Workers' Association”, founded in 1947.
But it was not before 1961 that the first union was registered under the Civil Code (Civil Code Proclamation, No.
165/1960).
In 1963 the first formal labour law (on collective labour relations) was established with the “Labour Relations Proclamation No.
210/1963”. This proclamation recognized the rights of associations of employers and workers, as well as a system of collective bargaining, and it set up machinery for the settlement of trade disputes – the Labour Relation Board.
Consecutively, in 1963 the “Federation of Employers of Ethiopia”, and in 1964 the “Confederation of Ethiopian Labour Unions” – CELU, were founded.
However, individual labour relations were treated exclusively like any other service contract according to the regulations of the Civil Code.
During the Dergue period (1974-91) as part of the socialist order of state and society, labour law was based on the public ownership of the means of production and was subject to central planning and central management.
The Labour Proclamation No.
64 of 1975 superseded the imperial Labour Relations Proclamation, and contained almost all provisions of a socialist labour law.
There was no autonomy with regard to the conclusion of collective agreements as a form of independent control over working life exercised by freely constituted trade unions.
There were no employers' organizations, and no contractual freedom between employer and employee.
;
Until recently, the main source of labour law, the Labour Proclamation, Proclamation No.
42/1993, was developed in the post-socialist time, marking the overcoming of the centralized state-economy towards a market oriented, pluralistic society.
Ethiopia was criticized for several years by the ILO Committee of Experts, which noted serious discrepancies between the national legislation and the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No.
87). It was partly in response to the observations made by the House of People's Representatives adopted Labour Proclamation No.
377/2003, effective since 26 February 2004.
This text repealed Labour Proclamation No.
42/1993 (as amended by Proclamation 88/1994).
It has become the principal source of labour law in Ethiopia.
So far the Committee of Experts has not published its comments on the new law.
It creates the full guarantee of freedom of association by abolishing trade union monopoly (Article 114), provided that the number of members of the union is not less than ten;
It recommends regulations on trade union property to be included into the constitution of workers' organizations (Article 117 (12) (new));
It introduces a simpler system of collective bargaining and labour dispute settlement, with specified time limits to speed up the resolution of conflict (Articles 130 (2), 142 (3), 143 and 151);
It intends to improve the efficiency of the Labour Relation Boards (Articles 145, 1474 (4), 149 (6), 150, 153 and 154);
It restricts the definition of “essential services” (Article 136 (2)), excluding railway and inter-urban bus services, filling stations and banks, thereby entitling workers or employers of these undertakings to the right to strike or lockout.
The major sources of labour law are federal regulations, above all the new Labour Proclamation No.
377/2003, some collective agreements, work statutes and some government's ordinances, for instance in the field of occupational Safety and Health regulations.
However, as Article 3 (2) of the Labour Proclamation excludes certain groups of workers from the application of the Proclamation, the following Acts may be considered, too:
Any contract of employment shall meet the requirements of Article 4 (1) to (5), namely it shall be clear, specifying the type of employment, the rate of payment and the duration of the contract.
The contract shall not lay down less favorable conditions for the employee than those provided by law, collective agreements or work rules.
Article 46 defines the home work contract, and entitles the Minister to give further directives.
These directives are not yet proclaimed and in force.
When concluding a contract of employment the parties may agree on a probationary period for the purpose of evaluating his or her suitability to the job (Article 11 (1)).
Such an agreement needs to be done in writing and shall not exceed forty-five consecutive days (Article 11(3)).
During this period, the employee enjoys the same rights and obligations that the other workers have (as defined in Articles 12 to 14), but termination is possible without notice, if he or she fails to meet the requirements (Article 11 (6)).
Severance pay or compensation is not to be paid (Article 11(5)).
leave of absence for the purpose of holding office in trade unions or other social services;
In the latter two cases of suspension the Ministry has to be informed in writing about the ground of the suspension (Article 19).
Articles 20 and 21 then describe the procedure of confirmation by the Ministry.
When the Ministry is convinced that the employer cannot resume its activities within the maximum period of suspension of 90 days, the worker shall be entitled to severance pay (Articles 21 (2), 39 and 44).
Generally any contract of employment might be terminated by both parties, and in accordance with the provisions of the law or a collective agreement.
Article 23 (2) states clearly that the transfer of ownership of an undertaking does not have a terminating effect.
Article 26 of the Labour Proclamation expressly recognizes the following grounds for termination of the employment contract:
commission of any of the unlawful activities defined in Article 14, such as reporting for work in a state of intoxication, refusal to be medically examined (except for HIV/AIDS test) or to observe Occupation Safety and Health prevention rules;
offences stipulated in a collective agreement as grounds for termination without notice.
Under Articles 36 to 41 any case of termination provokes payment obligations, such as wages, severance pay and – in the case of Article 32 (1) (the employee's poor work performance and/or incapacity) – an additional compensation which shall be thirty times his or her daily wages of the last week of service, for the first year of work.
The compensation will be paid in addition to the severance pay referred to in Articles 39 to 40.
There are certain limits on compensation.
The compensation will be hundred and eighty times the average daily wages and a sum equal to the remuneration for the appropriate notice period in the case of an unlawful termination of an unlimited contract (Article 43 (4) a)), and a sum equal to the wages that the worker would have obtained until the lawful end of his contract (Article 43 (4) b)).
Workers are entitled to a weekly rest period of 24 non-interrupted hours in a period of 7 days.
Unless otherwise stated in a collective agreement, the weekly rest should be on Sunday, but another day may be chosen for certain services (Article 70).
Any work exceeding the normal working time of 48 hours a week is overtime.
Overtime is only permissible for up to 2 hours a day, or 20 hours a month, or 100 hours a year, in the following cases (Article 67):
The proclamation defines the overtime payment in Article 68 (1).
The overtime payment ranges from a rate of one and one quarter (1 ¼) of the ordinary hourly rate (from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.) to two and one half (2 ½) on public holidays.
Pursuant to Article 68 (1) b), night work is work realized between 10 PM and 6 AM.
The worker is entitled to a rate of one and a half of the ordinary hourly wage.
Under Articles 73 to 75, public holidays are paid.
A worker who is paid on a monthly basis will not be subjected to a reduction in wages for not working on a public holiday.
An employee who works on a public holiday is entitled to the double of his or her ordinary hourly wages.
Furthermore, the Ethiopian Labour Proclamation provides one part (Part Six) to the Working Conditions of Women and Young Workers.
Maternity leave and maternity protection are regulated in Articles 87 and 88.
There are provisions around the nature of work that a pregnant employee is not permitted to perform where it could be hazardous to her or the child's health (Article 87 (2) to (6)).
Night work is generally prohibited, nor shall she be assigned to overtime-work.
Moreover she shall not be given an assignment outside her permanent place of work and be granted time off for medical examinations (Article 88 (1)).
Moreover, Article 81 to 84 of the Proclamation provide for special leave for family events, union activities and other special purposes, such as for hearings before bodies competent to hear labour disputes, to exercise civil rights, and for training purposes according to collective agreements or working rules.
Under Article 89 of the Labour Proclamation the statutory minimum age for young workers is 14 years.
Beyond the age of 14 years, no person may employ a child for work that is inappropriate or that endangers his or her life or health (Article 89 (2) and (3)).
Special measures of protection of young workers (e.g.
work in transport, night work, work in arduous, hazardous or unhealthy activities, such as mining) may be taken by the Minister.
Work performed under the regime of a vocational training course is exempted from this protection (Article 89 (5)).
Ethiopia ratified the ILO Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (No.
182), in September 2003.
Ethiopian law does not prescribe minimum wages through statute.
Usually wages are fixed by the employer or by collective agreements or by the employee's contract of employment.
Articles 53 and 54 of the Proclamation define “Wages” as the regular payment to which the worker is entitled in return for the performance of the work that he performs under a contract of employment.
Overtime pay, allowances, bonuses, etc are not considered as “wages”.
The Proclamation establishes the principle that wage is only paid for work done, except in cases, when the source of the impossibility to work was in the sphere of the employer (i.e.
non supply of working material).
Under Article 162 (2), claims for payment of wages, overtime and other payments shall be barred after six months from the date they became due.
In case of bankruptcy of the employer, wages enjoy priority.
If an insolvency proceeding has been opened over the employer's assets, the employees' claims of wages are treated with priority over other payments or debts in accordance with Article 167 of the Labour Proclamation and Article 1025 of the Commercial Code, Proclamation No.
166/1966.
The Constitution recognizes the right to freedom of association, the right to form and join a trade union and the right to participate in trade union activities.
Article 113 (2) lays down the trade union structure: There are trade unions (formed by workers), employer's associations, federations (organization established by more than one trade unions or employers' associations) and confederations (established by more than one trade union federations or employer federation).
The Proclamation allows a trade union or an employers' association to appeal the Ministry's decision to refuse to register to the competent court.
Articles 5 and 6 of the ILO Freedom of Association and Protection of the Rights to Organize Convention, 1948 ( No.
87), are addressed in Article 114 (3), (4), (5) and (6) of the Proclamation, permitting the establishment of federations and confederations by registered trade unions and employers' associations.
Subsection 8 allows individual employers to join established employers' federations.
At the national level, the Confederation of Ethiopian Trade Unions (CETU) claims to represent about 300,000 workers organized in 431 basic unions and 9 Federations (Federation of Food Beverage, Tobacco and Allied Workers; Ethiopian Federation of Metal, Wood, Cement and other Workers; Federation of Commerce, Technical Print, and other Workers; National Federation of Farm, Plantation, Fishery and Agro-Industry; National Federation of Tourism, Hotels and Generic Service Workers; Industrial Federation of Ethiopian Textiles, Garment and Shoe Workers; National Federation of Energy, Chemical, Petroleum Workers; Transport and Communication Workers; Ethiopian Banking and Insurance Industrial Federation).
The situation of the Ethiopian Teachers' Association (ETA) has been a cause of deep concern for some time.
An important step towards resuming a normal situation has been the release of Dr. Woldesemayat, President of ETA, following a decision of the Supreme Court in May 2002 after he had been arrested in 1996 and sentenced in 1999 to a prison term of 15 years.
However, in March 2003, the ILO's Committee on Freedom of Association reiterated its concern on this matter and requested the Government “ to amend its legislation so that teachers, like other workers, have the right to form organizations of their own choosing and to negotiate collectively, and to keep it informed of developments in this respect, including the current status of legislative reform as regards trade union pluralism and the labour rights of civil servants” (Case 1888) .
In its latest communication for the 2004 report of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations the Ethiopian Government specified that teachers are free to form associations to promote their occupational interests and that those working in Government institutions are governed by the Civil Servants Law, while those working in private undertakings are governed by the Labour Law.
Clarification on the specific provisions which guarantee to teachers, both civil servants and non-civil servants, the organisational rights under ILO Convention No.
87, is being requested (See the comments made by the ILO supervisory bodies in the ILO database ILOLEX ).
Union dues usually are deducted from the salary; this practice is mostly regulated in collective agreements or rather based on customary practice.
Details are regulated in Chapter 2 of the Labour Proclamation.
Article 124 defines “collective agreement” and “collective bargaining”.
The first is “ an agreement concluded in writing between one or more representatives of trade unions and one or more employers or agents or representatives of employers organizations”, whereas the latter is defined as “negotiation made between employers and workers organizations or their representatives concerning conditions of work or collective agreements or the renewal and modifications of the collective agreement”.
Article 125 (1) grants the right to collective bargaining to trade unions on the one hand and to employers or employers' organizations on the other hand.
De facto, collective bargaining takes place at the company level, even though the approach of the Labour Proclamation is different and leaves the choice of the appropriate level of collective bargaining to the parties and their judgment.
According to Article 130 any party may request the other party in writing.
There are an estimated 450 collective agreements in Ethiopia, mostly dealing with subject matters as benefits and increments (information given by the Ministry).
The proclamation defines the question of representation on the trade union's and on the employer's side (Art.
126). Any party may be assisted by advisors (Article 127).
Articles 128 and 129 of the Labour Proclamation define the subject matter and the content of a collective agreement, as “matters concerning the employment relationship and conditions of work as well as relations of employers and their organizations with workers' organizations”.
Upon signature of any collective agreement, the parties shall send copies of it to the Ministry for registration (Article 131).
Collective agreements apply to all parties covered (Article 134(1)) and where their provisions are more favorable to the workers than those provided by law (Article 134 (2)).
The collective agreement remains in force even after a trade union, which is party to the agreement, is dissolved.
Under Article 133 (3), the duration of an agreement is fixed at three years unless expressly stipulated otherwise.
The Constitution recognizes basic labour rights especially the right to strike, in its Article 42.
Under the previous law, the right to strike was expressly recognized but the pre-strike process was long and made legal strike action difficult.
Labour Proclamation No.
377, Chapter Five, covers strikes and lock-outs but expressly excludes “essential public service undertakings” from this Chapter.
Legal strike action continues to be hard to achieve in practice.
For example, pre-strike procedures include: the party initiating the action to give advance notice to the other party – and to the Ministry - with reasons for the strike or lock-out; both parties making all efforts to settle through conciliation; cooling-off period of 30 days after the notice; a pro-strike vote by a majority of workers concerned in a meeting in which are present at least two-thirds of the members of the trade union; and maintenance of minimum services for the respect of safety regulations and accident prevention in the undertaking concerned (Article 158).
Conciliation, arbitration and the Labour Relation Board
The requirement of conciliation means that the dispute is either brought before a conciliator assigned by the Ministry (Article 142 (3)), or before an arbitrator or conciliator agreed upon by the parties (Article 143).
If, in the first case, conciliation is not reached within 30 days, either party may submit the matter to the Labour Relation Board which shall give its decision within 30 days.
If, in the second case, the conciliation or arbitration fails, either party may move the procedure further by taking the case to the Board or to the appropriate court.
The Proclamation does not provide a time limit for reaching an agreement in these cases.
Nor is there a time limit for submitting the matter to the Board, apart from the general provisions under section 162 concerning periods of limitation for lodging claims (one year from the date on which the claim becomes enforceable, three months from the date of dismissal for reinstatement claims, and six months for wages and emoluments claims).
In its 2004 Report, [2] when noting the draft amendments, the Committee of Experts of the ILO explained that care should be taken to avoid establishing labour dispute settlement processes that amount to compulsory arbitration at the instigation of only one party in the dispute.
It states that, except in situations concerning essential services in the strict sense of the term and acute national crises, arbitration awards should be binding only where both parties have agreed to the procedure.
The Committee also recalled that arbitration procedures should not be excessively long.
Not all kinds of workers have the right to seek, initiate and conduct strike action.
First there are those who, as seen above, are excluded by section 3(a) of the Proclamation from its scope generally.
Secondly, the Proclamation specifically excludes from Chapter Five one class of workers, who consequently do not have the right to strike.
These are workers who are engaged in “essential public service undertakings”.
These services are defined in section 136 (3) to include:
This definition marks a great improvement over the longer list that had existed in the old law, but still awaits full scrutiny by the ILO's supervisory bodies in the framework of the principles of the right to strike.
In its 2004 Report, [3] when noting the draft amendments, the Committee of Experts explained that air transport and urban bus services are not essential services in the strict sense of the term and suggested that the Government give consideration to establishing a system of minimum service in these undertakings, rather than impose an outright ban on strikes therein.
Numerically, the workers engaged in these essential services represent a sizable proportion of trade union membership in the country.
In effect, lawful industrial actions are literally unknown in Ethiopia under these regulations.
The regulations of the previous Proclamation – in addition to the insufficient personnel structure of the judiciary in general - lead to a situation, where labour disputes were often pending for months and years.
In praxis there has never been a legal strike since the Labour Proclamation, No.
42 came into force in 1993.
With the entry into force of Proclamation No.
377 which slightly reduces the procedure, and fixes more time limits, the practice might, although doubtfully, change.
The Ethiopian Labour Proclamation gives Unions and Employers an important tool to participation in all labour matters of concern.
Article 170 (2) and 171 stipulate the Minister's duty to establish a Labour Advisory Board.
Pursuant to Article 170 (2), the Minister shall organize, co-ordinate, follow-up and execute the labour administration system by establishing () a permanent Advisory Board which consists members from the Ministry, employers associations and trade unions.
This Board is an organ “which shall study and examine matters concerning employment service, working conditions, the safety and health of workers, the labour laws in general and give advisory opinion to the Minister.
Its duties and responsibilities shall be determined in the directives to be issued by the Ministry” (Artcile 171).
Labour Disputes are generally regulated in part nine of the Ethiopian Labour Proclamation.
Individual disputes fall under the jurisdiction of labour divisions at the ordinary courts, established “as may be necessary” at each regional first instance court (Article 137(1)).
Article 138(1) lists the following individual labour disputes as examples:

As Labour Law is taught at Addis Ababa University and at the Mekele University (Employment Law) some students' thesis are available in the libraries of the respective law faculties.
How soon must an employer pay wages to an employee after terminating the employment of an employee?
How soon if an employee resigns?
Is an employer required to provide paid vacation, holiday pay, sick leave or severance pay?
Overtime is a provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act.

In reverse Order, under Utah Rules, an employer is required to pay an employee for required attendance at training.
If an individual employee is required to attend training and is not paid for that time they have the right to file for the unpaid wages as they would any other unpaid wage.
On call status is not normally considered work time.
However, the FLSA deals again with work required while on call and all hours of required travel and work performance are normally subject to overtime pay provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act.
The Wage and Hour Division of the U.S. Department of Labor has references to published position papers on these issues at www.dol.gov
Does the State of Utah require work permits for minors?
Employers in Utah are free to hire a minor without a work permit.
The expectation is that employers in employing minors will be complying with the standards concerning age-appropriate jobs, lunches and breaks, and hourly restrictions for minors under age 16.
There is a process in the statute where in limited, special circumstances, a request for a work authorization can be made to the Commission if the employment of the minor, such as in the case of a child actor, is going to involve odd work hours or other variances from the normal standards set forth in the statute or rules.

In response to globalising trends, new approaches and responses to labour management relations are emerging as the social partners seek to find appropriate responses to the effects of modernization and foreign competition.
In a speech delivered on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the Barbados Workers Union in Barbados, a senior member of the union stated “ anyone who has taken time out to follow what we have been doing in the BWU will note that, while we have remained true to the basic principles governing the organization 60 years ago, we have at the same time, been incrementally adjusting our policy and our action programmes to accommodate the change we anticipate, not merely within our Barbados environment, but within the wider Caribbean, as well as our position as a trade union within these global affairs that impact on us”.
Governments are also changing their labour management responses by seeking to encourage more dialogue with the social partners as a means of improving the labour relations climate.
There is also an increased focus on labour legislation reform, in recognition that much of the existing labour legislation is outdated and ineffective.
See: Strategy Paper on the Modenisation of Ministries of Labour as Facilitators of Human – Resource Oriented Strategies.
Public service initiatives to reform and modernise the public service“ The private sector considers that the most serious impediment to the establishment of an environment best suited to the fostering of a healthy business climate is the bureaucratic culture of the public sector and the relationship between the two sectors.
The relationship is at present characterised by “guarded mistrust” on the part of the public sector and a view on the part of certain elements in the private sector that the civil service is a costly and unnecessary waste of manpower .
Caribbean enterprises are entering into smart partnerships or strategic alliance with international enterprises.
Throughout the region efforts are being made to attract foreign investors, as are the tourism, energy, telecommunication and small manufacturing sectors in many Caribbean countries.
Additionally, there have been examples of international companies forming joint venture and other strategic alliances.
Strategic alliances and company mergers have made job security for workers much more unpredictable.
Job redesign .
To achieve the flexibility and productive efficiency required to respond quickly and effectively to market changes, broader job descriptions are now being used.
This is resulting in work tasks based on broader groupings of activities, emphasising the undertaking of "whole" tasks.
In some instances improved technology has been substituted for labour.
The strong alliance between the labour movement and government regimes has weakened over time, as a new cadre of political leaders from the professional class have emerged.
The generation of political leaders born of the trade union movement is dawning to a close.
Worker commitment to unions appears to be on the wane, especially for well educated “generation X’ers” .
Educated knowledge workers are less likely to be attracted to or dependent on trade unions.
This trend is affecting the movement’s ability to attract young recruits from the professional and managerial class.
Increased diversity in the workplace has brought more segmentation in the work force and new worker needs.
Trade unions have to address workers’ concerns relating to HIV/ AIDS, gender equity, sexual harassment, equality of treatment for physically challenged workers, workplace violence, crime, the expansion of the informal sector and environmental protection.
In response to these changes in the labour market, trade unions have to shift from an adversarial system of industrial relations to one based on partnership building.
The social partnership model is based on the coming together of the social partners to address critical industrial relations issues.
The collaboration of the social partners results in the drawing up of an agreement document or protocol.
The protocol defines expected levels of conduct during the life of the agreement, and defines the various ways by which conflict can be resolved.
An important element of conflict handling is the strengthening of the relationship between the partners.
“Another preferred approach for us is the tripartite discussions of social partners who recognise their shared responsibility for the labour market, each one understanding that it has as much a responsibility as the other for what happens in the labour market, and what happens to people who are excluded”
“The BWU prefers the labour management approach which is based on voluntarism.
This is a system where the Government permits the employers and the trade unions, with minimum government interference, to conduct labour management affairs and to reach levels of satisfactory relationships which the parties feel they can properly live with .
the Government still has to set down certain minimum standards below which the players will not go.”
This document sets out “the general Labour Policy to which the Region aspires, consistent with international standards and other international instruments.
It is an important policy guide on labour matters for the Social Partners and will contribute to the development of a healthy industrial relations climate, and enhanced social partnership.
It underscores the rights and responsibilities of the Social Partners, and provides the bases for the development of national labour policies, and inform the enactment of labour legislation”.
“1.1The Social Partners desire through association in a Social Compact to create a modern, efficient economy which is able to produce high and sustainable economic growth accompanied by increased employment, to establish through low inflation an equilibrium between prices and incomes, and to achieve a society which enjoys a greater degree of inclusiveness in all its facets .”
1.2 The Social Partners regard this Protocol as an instrument of policy to achieve industrial harmony and as a means to confront the challenges of globalization and the demands of the information age with a view to improving the competitiveness of the economy as part of the future social development of Barbados.”
Labour and employment legislation in Caribbean state have tended to be aligned to the furtherance of government economic polices.
Generally the labour legislation has been geared to foster an industrial relations climate that encourages investment.
This goal may not always be consistent with good labour standards.
Equal pay for equal value of work.
The enactment of ILO labour standards pertaining to hours of work, wages, severance pay, discipline and termination of workers, retrenchment, maternity leave, health and safety the registration of trade unions.
The rights of trade unions to be recognised as the bargaining agents for workers in bargaining units.
The rights of workers to form and be members of a trade union.
In response to the changing economic and labour market conditions, many States are in the process of revising their labour laws.
CARICOM had prepared a Declaration of Labour Relations Principles as a guide for labour ministries.
Grenada has one of the most modern labour laws in the Caribbean.
The Grenada Labour Code is based on ILO Standards and was developed through a process of social partner consultation, and consensus.
The process took twelve years.
The social partners have recognised that traditional labour management approaches are not effective.
Private sector organisations have realised that adversarial labour relations and distributive collective bargaining limits the implementation of “high road” strategies and this affects the viability and competitiveness of enterprises.
Labour leaders are also aware that embracing the social partnership model is the way forward.
The Governments in the region are also supporting “high road” development approaches creating the climate for improved industrial relations through the introduction of new labour law initiatives.
Together the social partners are positively influencing labour market relations.
More professional and objective negotiations, labour relations stability, more flexible collective bargaining agreements, and significant reduction in probabilities of strike or job action.
For organizations choosing a "hardball" strategy, management takes a position in which they view the union representatives as always wrong and feel that the union must consistently be contested.
Arbitration and mediation become a way of life.
Management assesses a situation, figures out a solution, and then, somehow, jams the solution down the throat of the union.
Management views the union as a major roadblock which must be bulldozed.
It doesn't matter what the issue is, Sunday overtime premium or seniority provisions; if management is to make progress, they must remove the roadblock at any cost.
From a management perspective playing hardball may be an effective strategy in dealing with unions.
But, it is costly and is divisive within the plants or offices.
In addition, people lose focus of their primary goal of serving the customer's needs.
The focus moves from what is right to who is right.
Each side presumes that their position is always right, and that is simply not true.
Finally, taking a hardball approach often places the decision making authority into the hands of an arbitrator, a person who has no interest in serving the needs of the customers.

Following the fall of the Saddam regime in April, organizers of the independent unions resurfaced.
In Basra, they mounted a strike two days after the arrival of British troops, demanding the right to organize and protesting the appointment of a Ba'ath Party member as the new mayor.
In June, 400 union activists met in Baghdad, forming the Workers Democratic Trade Union Federation.
The group laid plans to reorganize unions in twelve of the country's main industries.
"At the beginning, we thought our situation might get better after we got rid of Saddam.
But it hasn't," says Jassim Mashkoul, director of communications of the trade union federation.
Dathar Al-Kashab, who was appointed to manage the Al Daura refinery two months ago, having been an engineer there since 1966, predicts that privatization would have an enormous effect.
"A worker starting here today has a job for life under the old system.
There is no law that permits me to lay him off.
But if I put on the hat of privatization, I'll have to fire 1,500 [of the refinery's 3,000] workers," he says.
"In America when a company lays people off, there's unemployment insurance, and they won't die from hunger.
If I dismiss employees now, I'm killing them and their families.
"
Despite the hostility of the Coalition Provisional Authority, the fall of the Saddam regime has led to an explosion of workplace organizing activity.
Low wages are one motivation.
The Iraqi government employs 70 percent of the workforce.
The authority has set an emergency pay scale.
Though The New York Times says wages are going up, that's not what I found.
Most workers get about $60 a month, a small group gets $120, and a tiny minority (mostly administrators and managers) $180.
This is the same wage scale that prevailed under the last few years of the Saddam Hussein regime.
Working conditions are exhausting and dangerous.
At the Al Daura refinery, Detrala Beshab, president of the refinery's new union, notes that while the workday is officially seven hours, the day shift is actually eleven hours long, and the night shift thirteen hours.
Since workers are paid by the month, there is no overtime pay.
"When we talked to the manager, he told us he had to talk to the oil ministry, which had to talk to the finance ministry, which had to get permission from the coalition forces," he says.
"The coalition forces control the finances--and our wages.
"
At the shoe and vegetable oil factories, another new labor group called the Workers' Unions and Councils began organizing workers this summer.
With its encouragement, shoe factory workers formed a union and demanded legal recognition.
Like workers at the refinery, they complained about long hours without overtime pay, no vacations, and the disappearance of their extra pay when the occupation started.
"Life has gotten much worse," one worker says.
"Everything is controlled by the coalition.
We don't control anything.
"
Arab trade unionists are among the most adamant.
"War makes privatization easy: First you destroy the society, and then you let the corporations rebuild it," says Hacene Djemam, general secretary of the International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions.
NHS hospitals are usually larger than private facilities and most of them are teaching hospitals.
Nurses may find the working conditions less pressured in private hospitals where the ratio of nurses to patients is significantly higher.
UK Nursing Agencies play a vital role in supplying the NHS hospitals and private hospitals with nurses.
Do I need a visa or work permit to work as a nurse in the UK?
With a UK work permit you will need to be sponsored by a hospital, private clinic or company in order to work in the UK.
In that instance you are normally required to commit to at least a year with that employer due to the expenses and paper work involved in sponsoring overseas candidates.
In the UK nurses are graded in seniority from grade A to grade I, with registered nurses beginning at grade D. Newly registered nurses can expect to start on a salary of around £17,000 which can increase to up to £30,000 at the most senior level I.
The new NHS Agenda for Change pay system is divided into nine pay bands, with several pay increments within each band.
Entry level nurses currently begin in band five with the most senior nursing positions falling in band eight.
Levels of pay increase as you gain experience and progress through the increments in each band.
The International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) is the main international trade union organisation, representing the interests of working people worldwide.
It has 301 affiliated member organisations in 151 countries and territories, with a total membership of 176 million workers.
The ITUC was founded at its inaugural Congress in Vienna, Austria, on 1 -3 November 2006.
It groups together the former affiliates of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), along with trade union organisations which had no global affiliation.
The ICFTU and the WCL dissolved themselves on 31 October 2006, to pave the way for the creation of the ITUC.
The ITUC’s primary mission is the promotion and defence of workers’ rights and interests, through international cooperation between trade unions, global campaigning and advocacy within the major global institutions.
The Programme Document adopted at the ITUC founding Congress sets out the Confederation’s overall policy framework.
Its main areas of activity include:
The ITUC adheres to the principles of trade union democracy and independence, as set out in its Constitution.
It is governed by four-yearly world congresses, a General Council and an Executive Bureau.
The chief executive of the ITUC is its General Secretary Sharan Burrow, supported by Deputy General Secretary Jaap Wienen.
The ITUC also cooperates closely with the European Trade Union Confederation, including through the Pan-European Regional Council, which was created on March 2007.
The ITUC has close relations with the Global Union Federations and the Trade Union Advisory Committee to the OECD (TUAC), working together through the Global Unions Council.
The main aim of the ITUC Equality Department is to work to ensure that those millions of people can live and work in conditions characterised by equality, dignity and justice.
Young men and women workers are another vulnerable group, despite the fact that they represent our world’s present and its future.
Addressing their concerns and expectations effectively and ensuring their full involvement in trade unions are essential tasks.
A major focus of ITUC work is to ensure full and universal respect for the Fundamental Workers’ Rights of the ILO, which guarantee the right to organise in a trade union, the right to collective bargaining, protection from discrimination, and the elimination of child labour and forced labour.
Together with its affiliates, its regional organisations, the Global Union Federations, as well as with non-governmental organisations, the ITUC carries out ongoing campaign action for the universal respect of trade union rights, as guaranteed by the Conventions of the International Labour Organisation (ILO).
The ITUC defends trade unionists whenever their fundamental human rights are violated as a result of their trade union activities.
It also takes action against other labour rights violations, and other violations of human rights especially where these affect working people.
The ITUC’s work in this area includes research and documentation of national labour laws and practices, international trade union solidarity actions to support those whose rights are under attack, publicising violations to bring public pressure on those responsible, putting pressure on governments and employers which violate workers’ rights and by taking cases to the international judicial mechanisms of the ILO and also to United Nations human rights bodies.
25 June 2010: On Friday 25 June, Sharan Burrow was elected General Secretary of the ITUC.
On the fifth and final day of its second World Congress in Vancouver (Canada) Sharan Burrow was elected to succeed Guy Ryder, the first General Secretary of the ITUC, the world’s largest international trade union organisation, founded in Vienna in 2006.
Sharan Burrow will leave her post of President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), that she has held since 2000, to become the first woman at the helm of the ITUC.
The election of the first female General Secretary of the ITUC is historically significant for the global trade union movement and occurs at a time of high participation for women at the ITUC Congress with 50 % of delegate’s seats being held by women.
Labour Market Justice and Equity: Reversing the inequalities of the past requires the restoration of justice and balance in labour markets.this requires us to fight for workers’ rights; to promote higher levels of trade union organisation and collective bargaining coverage; to combat precarious and informal work; and to campaign to close the gender pay gap and to eliminate all other types of gender inequality at work.
Governance of Globalisation: The global crisis is a direct consequence of the failure of the international community to impose adequate governance on a process of globalisation driven solely by the dynamics of deregulation, liberalisation and privatisation.
The G20 must maintain its commitment to jobs and development, and these commitments be taken up by all governments as a move towards more effective and inclusive global governance.
Today’s market fundamentalism must be replaced with a commitment to policy coherence for a social dimension in globalisation, with decent work as the overriding policy objective based on the ratification and full implementation of international labour standards.
Employment and social protection must sit side by side with economic indicators including growth and inflation as real measures of risk and progress,
You have reminded us that we all have special responsibilities for the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in the workforce, many of them young workers or women, and called attention to the needs of migrant workers and those in the informal economy.
We must begin by building stronger and truly inclusive trade unions that can respond to the unfulfilled needs of a massive and growing number of workers in a range of different circumstances who need representation.
To Mamounata Cisse, a proud trade union woman we say thank you, for your dedication, your sisterhood, and your proud advocacy of trade union work.
Again we are pleased to continue to have your support as an ILO official in Africa.
Colleagues, we must never forget those who have paid the ultimate price and given their lives for the ambitions we share and indeed we will not give up on those incarcerated for their place in trade union, peace and democratic struggles.
The International Trade Union Confederation, which is made up of 309 labour organisations from more than 156 countries, is holding its inaugural meeting Vienna.
Leadership of new trade union international ready for business
ITUC OnLine 006/021106 Leadership of new trade union international ready for business Vienna, November 3, 2006 (ITUC OnLine): Guy Ryder has been elected General Secretary of the ITUC on the 3rd and final day of its Founding Congress.
Congress also elected a 70 person Governing Council, with an additional 8 seats being reserved for youth and women’s representatives.
Commenting on his election and with the leadership team in place, Guy Ryder said today: “I am honoured by the confidence placed in me by the delegates of the Congress in entrusting me with this position.
Tomorrow we start the work of the new international with a renewed optimism and hope, knowing that we are stronger, not just in numbers but in the diversity that that we bring together”.
“In founding the ITUC we have recognized that if we are to fulfill the promise of improving people’s lives, we have no choice but to change.
The word solidarity has never had as much meaning and importance as now.
And practical solidarity, in the form of international campaigning and organizing is what we intend to deliver.” “The challenges are many but we will not shirk from them.
We will tackle those employers who exploit workers, those governments who deny their people the right to organize and we will take action to bring about a world in which decent work is not just a distant dream, but the reality of people’s lives.”

Where do I get a work permit?
The state of Tennessee does not require work permits.
The minor needs to provide the prospective employer with a copy one of the following documents as proof of age; birth certificate, driver license, state issued ID, or a copy of their passport.
Tennessee has no wage laws concerning overtime, minimum wage, or the regulation of salaried employees.
The United States Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division enforces the Fair Labor Standards Act regulating minimum wage, overtime and salaried employees.
Further information concerning these matters may be found at the WH division of the Department of Labor web site.
No employer shall discriminate between employees in the same establishment on the basis of sex by paying one employee more or less than he pays to any employee of the opposite sex for comparable skill, effort and responsibility in which they are performed under similar working conditions.
However, nothing prohibits wage deferential based on a seniority system, a merit system, a system which measures earnings by quality production or any other reasonable deferential which is based on a factor other than sex.
Title 50-2-201 thru 207
If I complain about equal pay, whose wages would be adjusted?
Is an employer required by law to provide paid vacation, holidays, severance pay, sick pay or health insurance?
If an employer's policy provides a paid vacation and the employee's employment is terminated, is the employer required to compensate for any vacation time I have accrued but not used?
No.
Unless the employer's policy or its labor agreement specifically requires compensation of unused "vacation pay or other compensatory time" to an employee upon his or her termination of employment, Tennessee Code Annotated § 50-2-103(a)(3) does not require that an employee's final wages include such compensation.
There is no Tennessee law which prevents an employer from firing an employee because they file a complaint with our office, unless the complaint was equal pay.

The Act was a response to a call upon a Nation's conscience, at a time when the challenge to our democracy was the tens of millions of citizens who were denied the greater part of what the very lowest standards of the day called the necessities of life; when millions of families in the midst of a great depression were trying to live on incomes so meager that the pall of family disaster hung over them day by day; when millions were denied education, recreation, and the opportunity to better their lot and the lot of their children; when millions lacked the means to buy the products of farm and factory and by their poverty denied work and productiveness to many other millions; and, when one-third of a Nation was ill-housed, ill-clad, and ill-nourished.

Employers should also be required to put any statements regarding job security in such a pre-employment agreement as well so employees are able to more intelligently to make decisions whether to accept a job.
For example, a clear statement that an employee is employed at will would serve both to notify employees of their at-will employment relationship and insulate employers from breach of contract suits.
However, this aspect of the agreement is not the subject of this article.

Perhaps a six month notice term could be required before a wage agreement could be changed if an at-will employment relationship exists.
Without such a term, the employer would be free to offer an agreement and then change the employee's working conditions right after the employee begins his or her employment.
Such a requirement would not affect the employee's job security, as it would merely state the terms of employment while employed.
Regulations would have to be promulgated which define when the six month notice must be given and whether there may be any exceptions to this general rule.
For example, one exception to this general rule would arise when an employee desires to switch from receiving overtime pay to compensatory time for working over a set number of hours.

The changes in work scheduling that have taken place during the last decade have substantially increased employee choices over their personal and professional lives.
But work scheduling is more than a purely social issue; flexible work schedules can help further national goals, particularly in energy conservation and productivity growth.
Compressed workweeks, for example, can substantially cut energy consumption.
Flexible schedules of all kinds can raise employee morale and boost productivity.
And work sharing, which avoids layoffs by distributing reduced work time among all of a plant's employees, can serve as a cushion against cyclical recessions.

Interestingly, in the 1940's an argument was made that overtime penalties penalized workers because employers were required to place certain employees on inconvenient "staggered" shifts.
The Department of Labor dismissed this argument by inaccurately predicting that such shifts would only be adopted by a small percentage of employers.

Since the enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), union and non-union employers have wrestled with the issue of whether to grant a disabled employee’s request for a reasonable accommodation when granting such request would force the employer to violate its own seniority system.
The United States Supreme Court, however, has recently resolved the issue in U.S. Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, ruling in favor of the employer.
While the ruling is considered a major victory for all employers, it does not create a bright-line rule permitting employers to deny all requests for reasonable accommodation when another employee’s seniority is affected.
Barnett, who was employed as a cargo handler, suffered a back injury.
To accommodate his injury, U.S. Airways initially transferred him to a less strenuous mailroom job.
The mailroom job subsequently became open as a result of job bidding pursuant to the terms of an employer-promulgated seniority program.
As a result, employees more senior to Barnett were permitted to apply for the position.
When an employee with greater seniority was selected for the position based upon the the terms of the policy, Barnett asked his employer to make an exception to the policy and permit him to remain in the less strenuous position.
U.S. Airways refused, and Barnett was subsequently terminated.
Barnett challenged his termination, arguing that U.S. Airways’ failure to grant his request for a reasonable accommodation violated the ADA.
The Court disagreed.
In considering the interplay between an employer’s obligation under the ADA to provide reasonable accommodations and the terms of an employer’s seniority system, the Supreme Court recognized that generally, any proposed accommodation that would require an employer to violate its own seniority system is in and of itself, not reasonable.
In so holding, the Court recognized that well-established seniority systems provide employees with a sense of fairness, uniform treatment, job security and opportunities for predictable job advancement based upon objective criteria.
Requiring an employer to ignore such policies simply is not reasonable as a matter of law.
The Court’s ruling, however, falls short of creating a per se rule that requests for reasonable accommodations which affect seniority systems should always be denied.
For example, the Court limited its ruling by acknowledging that an employee may be able to demonstrate that a request for a reasonable accommodation that conflicts with the terms of a seniority system is not unreasonable when the employer has retained its right to unilaterally change the terms of the seniority system or has frequently made exceptions to the policy.
Under those circumstances, an employee may be able to establish that ignoring the terms of a seniority system is, in fact, reasonable under the ADA.
In light of this decision, employers should review the terms of their seniority systems, regardless of whether they are part of a collective bargaining agreement or a separate policy, and apply them consistently and without exception.
Consistent and uniform application of bona fide seniority systems in both union and non-union settings will not only create and foster employee expectations of fair and objective treatment, but is also an essential element in determining whether an employee’s request for an accommodation is reasonable as a matter of law.
Employers may continue to offer leave policies that are more generous than the FMLA as long as these policies meet the FMLA’s minimum requirements of providing 12 weeks of unpaid leave.

By joining with your colleagues in a union at your workplace you benefit in many ways.
On the job, your union brings together the collective strength of you and your co-workers to insure meaningful negotiations with management for an equitable contract.
Besides wages and salaries, areas that can be negotiated include: staffing and overtime, safety and health, cost of living raises, adequate pensions, vacations, equitable promotion systems and transfer policies, and a workable grievance system.
Through your union, you and your co-workers oversee carrying out the provisions of the contract.
If necessary, a union may take contract violations and wrongs to workers to third-party impartial arbitration.
The reality is professional employees are increasingly losing control of their work lives.
At non-union worksites management makes all the decisions concerning the wages, benefits, and working conditions for professional employees.
This is generating conflict between employees concerned about the delivery of their professional services and human resource managers more concerned with the bottom line.
These professional employees are turning increasingly to unions.
For the latest statistics about the unionization of professionals, check the Fact Sheets on the website of the Department for Professional Employees, AFL-CIO (DPE) at http://www.dpeaflcio.org/programs/factsheets.htm.
What about job security — do the unions make a difference here too?
What can a union offer me on things like working conditions and hours of work?
Union contracts often provide for fair and flexible working hours, better pay for overtime and work on evenings and weekends, more paid holidays, paid family and medical leave and employer help with child care and elder care.
Besides your union contract, unions lobby for better laws and programs to help America’s working families.
Unions were a major force behind passage of the Family and Medical Leave Act and are working hard for improved child care, elder care and other policies.
With today’s unions, working people have a better chance to balance not only our family budgets but our family schedules.
Balancing the demands of jobs and families is a challenge for most working Americans, and today’s unions help working women and men gain a little control over our lives.
Won’t a union stifle individual achievement with things like raises and promotions determined solely by seniority?
Salaries and promotions are subjects for collective bargaining.
Without a union, management makes these decisions unilaterally, usually without any worker input.
Through collective bargaining, management and the union must agree on the mechanisms to be used, and that agreement is included in a legally binding contract.
There are no preconditions.
Employees, through their elected union representatives, may bargain for any viable system they believe best suits their profession and employment.
For example, some union contracts provide not only for annual cost of living increases but a pool of dollars for merit increases.
The combination assures a minimum of equity and recognition of individual achievement.
Seniority need not be the only criterion for promotion.
A formal procedure could be devised which would include ratings by both supervisors and peers, credit for advanced education and training programs, and anything else that is deemed relevant by the professional group.
A formal promotion and layoff procedure with rules known by all is preferable to no ground rules at all.
But such a system can only be devised and implemented by a union and its members.
In a non-union work place, management retains the legal right to make all decisions regarding our jobs.
Benefits can be arbitrarily cut including pay, pensions, health care, severance, vacations and holidays without notice to the employees.
With a union, benefits and other working conditions cannot be changed at the drop of a hat; they have to be negotiated, and the union members can vote for or against the proposed changes.
Even during difficult times, the employer must justify its actions to the members of the union, who make an informed choice.
Company has established "Flexible Part Time Employees" job description.
These are part time employees that are hired with the expection that their schedule will be flexible and permit them from time to time to work hours beyond their normally scheduled shift or other non-scheduled hours including split shifts.
Article 6 - Working Hours, Sunday Differential and Overtime
Four-day work weeks with at least two, possibly three consecutive days off.
These shifts will be bid by seniority.
Holiday weeks revert back to 5 day workweeks.
PTO will be 10 hours for one day of PTO.
Mandatory Overtime Cap - increased from 8 hours to 10 hours in a week.
Overtime language applies to full time employees only.
Part time employees may be asked, or may be required to work non-scheduled hours.
Article 6 - Working Hours, Sunday Differential and Overtime
Overtime Administration - For the sole purpose of providing equal and impartial distribution of overtime, all overtime hours offered by an employee's supervisor, the hours refused shall be posted as well as overtime hours worked on a weekly basis.
Scheduling of Non-Selected Tours - This language shall apply to limited situations (i.e.
training). The company may assign tours outside of seniority on the following basis: 0-5 years service - up to 15 weeks annually; 5-10 years service - up to 8 weeks annually; 10-20 years service - up to 6 weeks annually; and 20+ years service - up to 4 weeks annually.
This is an MOA.
Call Center - Holiday Bidding: Holiday bidding will be completed no later than December 15th for the following year.
The bidding will begin with the most senior employee.
The employee will select as many holidays as management determines are required including one alternate holiday.
When a holiday shift is vacant and the company has to assign an employee to work, the assignment will be based on the alternate holiday selected in inverse seniority order.
In any event, the company reserves the right to assign holiday shifts as necessary in inverse seniority order.
Effect of Leaves of Absence on Accrued PTO: Dates of the month (1st, 15th, etc.

If there is an impending layoff, the company agrees to permit regular full-time employees to volunteer to terminate their employment if the employee is in the same classification as the employee slated for layoff; if the volunteer agrees to receive as a layoff allowance either the amount that would be received by most senior employees slated to be laid off of the layoff allowance the volunteer would have received based on the employee's seniority, whichever is less; the volunteer must notify the company of an interest in volunteering for the layoff within one calendar week; or the company's determination of whether to accept the volunteer will be final and shall not be subject to arbitration under the agreement.
Sales and Service Technicians: June 4, 2006 - 2.75%; June 3, 2007 - 2.5%; June 1, 2008 - 2%.
In addition, Sales and Service Technicians will receive a lump sum bonus payment semi-annually, which will be 1% of the base wages for the group (depending on performance the amount will be between .75% and 1.25%).
The amount will be set by the number of districts achieving the targets.
These payments will begin in July 2007 and then every six months thereafter.
Out-state technicians will be brought up to the Metro pay scale.
There will now be only one pay scale for all technicians.
The Labour Act, 1990 (LA), is the major source of law in Gambia in relation to termination of employment at the initiative of the employer.
The following workers are excluded from the provision of the LA dealing with termination of employment: any employee over 55 who has reached a contractual retirement age; any employee over 65; a probationary employee; and any employee whose dismissal is certified as being in accordance with the national interest by the Secretary of the Cabinet.
participation in trade union activities, including the organization of lawful industrial action outside working hours or, with the express consent of the employer, within working hours;
When collective dismissal is being considered, the employer has to provide the relevant trade unions with written information concerning the circumstances giving rise to the need for dismissal, possible alternative options and whether they are feasible, whether redeployment or retraining has been considered, whether it is reasonably possible that a certain number of employees might be re-employed during the next year, and the principles which will be taken into account when deciding on whom to dismiss (such as “last in, first out”).
The employer must then consult with relevant trade unions (sec.
119, LA).
The provisions governing collective dismissal shall not apply to employers with five or less employees in all his or her establishments, or where a collective agreement governs the conditions of collective dismissal (sec.
119(3), LA).
termination of the employment relationship during the probation period;
Before dismissal takes place, the employee has to be informed about the reasons for dismissal and has to be given a reasonable chance to respond (sec.
113, LA).
The dismissed employee has the right to approach the Industrial Tribunal (sec.
121, LA).
Such an employee also has the right to be represented by a trade union representative (sec.
113, LA).
Where the employer does not comply with these conditions, it will constitute an unfair dismissal, unless the employer can prove that the employee was aware of these rights (sec.
113(3) and (4), LA).
The Industrial Tribunal has jurisdiction over dismissal disputes (sec.
21(2), LA).
Any party who is aggrieved by a decision may appeal to the Supreme Court whose decision is final (sec.
43(1), LA).
The Industrial Labour Tribunal has jurisdiction over all types of dismissal claims (sec.
112, LA).
Claims can be filed with the Industrial Tribunal within six months from the date of dismissal.
The burden of proof rests with the employer (sec.
115, LA).
Where the employer cannot prove the reasons for dismissal, such dismissal will be deemed unfair.
In cases where no settlement is reached by the parties, the Industrial Tribunal has jurisdiction to order reinstatement or compensation or both.
The Industrial Tribunal has the power to award such compensation as it considers just and equitable, although this amount can be reduced by reason of the conduct of the employee in contributing to his or her dismissal or in failing to mitigate the loss he or she has suffered (sec.
123, LA).
According to sec.
123(3), the court will also consider, inter alia, other job opportunities available, the value of contractual benefits to which the employee might reasonably have expected to become entitled to had he or she not been dismissed; and the value of statutory rights such as pensions or other accrued benefits.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Macau SAR (China)
Problematic areas remain in the legal framework for trade unions despite the adoption of a new labour relations law in 2009.
Freedom of association is guaranteed under local law, and the law prohibits the dismissal of workers on grounds of their membership of a union or their union activities.
However, the new labour relations law fails to provide adequate protection for part-time workers and migrant workers whilst providing excessive flexibility to employers.
The Guidelines on the Professional Ethics and Conduct of Public Servants also appear to require civil servants to seek prior permission from managers before joining a trade union.
Furthermore, while Macau legislation provides that agreements concluded between employers and workers shall be valid, it does not explicitly state that such agreements should be concluded or that they should involve collective bargaining.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Background: Since the start of the global financial crisis, the casino construction boom has slowed and many employers have laid off workers, in many cases with little or no compensation.
National security laws passed at the end of 2008 could lead to the restriction of union activity on grounds of subversion, sedition or succession.
A new chief executive was sworn in in December: Fernando Chui Sai On was the sole candidate for the post and was "voted" in by 282 of the 300-member election committee nominated predominately for their pro-Beijing affiliation.
Throughout 2009 there were increasing protests over pay and working conditions, illegal imported labour and the passing of the Article 23 National Security legislation.
Lack of union law has crucial impact: A proposed trade union law drafted by unionist and legislator Jose Pereira Coutinho failed to gain support in 2009 for the third time.
The outcome was not surprising given the lack of independent legislators in the legislative body.
Still, the failure of Macau to have a law governing trade unions has very negative effects for workers, who are often unaware of the role of trade unions and unable to get information at their workplace.
Most workers with disputes have to present complaints to the Labour Bureau or attempt to speak to the employer alone.
Both the Bureau and the workers have little negotiating power with employers, who generally ignore the complaints and complainants.
In some cases, the Labour Bureau will try to deter complainants.
China's influence over union activity: It is widely believed that the central government of the People's Republic of China has a strong influence over local trade union activities, including the direct selection of the leadership of the largest private sector union, the Federation of Trade Unions.
Nearly all of the six main private sector unions belong to this pro-Beijing federation.
This has undermined the independence of trade unions, since support for central government policies, such as the minimisation of workplace disruption, overrides the protection of the rights and interests of trade union members.
There have been reports of intimidation of those who do speak out against the Beijing government both politically and in terms of labour rights.
Civil society is weak, but following the May Day rally in 2007 there has been a growth of smaller and more vocal trade unions, alongside a growth in civil society associations.
Difficulties in registering organisations and trade unions: In practice, many labour groups and unions find it difficult to register as organisations.
Informal worker groups and attempts to form labour groups are not allowed, recognised or permitted to exist.
In many cases, organisers are asked to submit the names of potential members before registration.
However, due to well-grounded fears of retribution and blacklisting, many supporters are unwilling to provide full details.
Employers' power: It is common practice in Macau for workers not to have formal employment contracts with their employers.
The power of employers to unilaterally change the wages and working conditions of employees or to terminate employment (equivalent to dismissal) is therefore unchecked.
In the context of this excessive employer power and with no legal-institutional framework for collective bargaining or even employment contracts, workers are easily victimised and discriminated against for their union activities.
The use of temporary contracts has been increasing, making workers even more vulnerable to abuse and intimidation.
Migrant workers denied rights: There were an estimated 89,300 non-resident workers in November 2009, a decrease from the preceding year.
Over half are from mainland China.
Migrant workers are denied the most basic forms of protection and have no right to collective bargaining and no effective legal recourse in the case of unfair dismissal.
Most generally earn less than half the wage of local workers employed at the same job, and contracts are between labour recruitment agents and the employer, rather than directly between the employee and his or her boss.
According to independent legislators and migrants' group, the new law on the Employment of Foreign Employees from October 2009 remains discriminatory and is too vague.
The bill imposes a levy on employers of non-resident workers, gives a six month re-entry ban on workers who terminate their contracts and prohibits the transfer to other job categories.
Wage arrears rising: With more foreign investment in the SAR, the increasing use of sub-contractors and the use of less-protected migrant workers, wages arrears has become a common problem, especially in the construction sector.
The procedure to get wage arrears in front of the Labour Bureau is lengthy and cumbersome.
According to the Civil Servants Union, a simple labour dispute could take one year to process by the Bureau followed by another two years in court.
The majority of migrant workers cannot afford to wait this long, and many leave within this period.
Blacklisting unionists and denial of re-entry to Macau: Macau is believed to keep a blacklist of local workers who have supported local strikes and regularly denies entry to "trouble-makers".
In March five Hong Kong legislators including Lee Cheuk Yan, General Secretary of the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions, were denied entry.
Lee Cheuk Yan reported that he had recently been denied entry three times.
2009 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Macau SAR (China)
Freedom of association: Freedom of association is guaranteed under local law.
Trade unions may be formed and anyone can join one.
The dismissal of workers on grounds of their membership of a trade union or their trade union activities is prohibited by law, and there are clauses in the criminal law that prohibit the interference of public authorities in workers' freedom of association.
Civil servants excluded: Certain clauses specifically exclude civil servants and migrant workers from the protection of the labour law.
Introduction of national security laws: In October 2008, the Macau SAR government introduced draft legislation on national security under Article 23 of the Basic Law for public consultation.
The draft was widely criticised by local and international groups, including the ITUC.
The consultation period was set at only 40 days, which was inadequate in view of the importance of the legislation.
After a short period of consultation, the legislation was only slightly revised by the government and passed in principle by the Legislative Council in December despite the opposition of the minority pro-democracy legislators.
The legislation introduces mainland notions of national security into Macau and outlines criminal sanctions for the crimes of subversion, succession, sedition and treason.
If widely applied this could be used against labour activists and others attempting to promote workers' and trade union rights.
It could also impact trade union activities, especially industrial action, strikes, assemblies or public marches or those linked to foreign trade union organisations.
New labour relations law introduced: On 5 August 2008, a long awaited labour relations law was passed, which will come into effect in January 2009.
The law, developed by a standing committee primarily made up of officials and businesses, fails to provide adequate protection for part-time workers and migrant workers whilst providing excessive flexibility to employers.
Some groups believe the law is a big step backward for workers' rights.
Certain clauses in the new law specifically exclude civil servants, migrant workers, apprentices and employees under vocational training contracts from the protection of the labour relations law.
In addition, there are guidelines requiring public servants to seek prior permission of managers before joining a trade union.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2008
China's influence: It is widely believed that the central government of the People's Republic of China has a strong influence over local trade union activities, including the direct selection of the leadership of the largest private sector union, the Federation of Trade Unions.
Nearly all of the six main private sector unions belong to this pro-Beijing federation.
This has undermined the independence of trade unions, since support for central government policies, such as the minimization of workplace disruption, overrides the protection of the rights and interests of trade union members.
There have been reports of intimidation of those who do speak out against the Beijing government both politically and in terms of labour rights.
Civil society is weak but growing in Macao.
The growing influence of the central government, combined with increasing prosperity for many residents, will further reduce independent worker movements.
Civil society is weak but has been growing in Macao in recent years.
Following the May Day rally in 2007 there has been a growth of smaller and more vocal trade unions, alongside a growth in civil society associations.
Employers' power: It is common practice in Macao for workers not to have formal employment contracts with their employers.
The power of employers to unilaterally change the wages and working conditions of employees or to terminate employment (equivalent to dismissal) is therefore unchecked.
In the context of this excessive employer power and with no legal-institutional framework for collective bargaining or even employment contracts, workers are easily victimized and discriminated against for their union activities.
The use of temporary contracts has been increasing, making workers even more vulnerable to abuse and intimidation.
No protection for strikers: Whilst the right to strike is supposed to be protected by law, there is no legal protection against retribution by employers for involvement in strike action.
Striking workers may therefore be dismissed during or after industrial action, regardless of the negotiated outcome.
Strike leaders and union activists also report that they are blacklisted by the local business sector.
Migrant workers: The number of registered migrant workers reached 95,574 in November 2008, nearly 10,000 more than in December 2007.
More than half of the migrant workers are from mainland China.
Migrant workers are denied the most basic forms of protection.
Although migrant workers usually have employment contracts, they have no right to collective bargaining and no effective legal recourse in the case of unfair dismissal.
While they are entitled to compensation as a result of dismissal before the termination of their contracts, it is common practice for migrant workers to be issued with short-term contracts: resulting in failure to be compensated.
The use of illegal (and hence unprotected) labour is also a problem for Macao authorities who regularly launch crackdowns on the use of illegally imported workers, from Southeast Asia and mainland China.
They mainly work in construction, small & medium enterprises and as domestic helpers.
The high percentage of foreign labour is eroding the bargaining power of local residents to improve working conditions and increase wages.
With the increased number of construction projects (Casinos and hotels primarily) there has been a relaxation of regulations.
Some unions and other groups have been trying to ensure that the use of imported labour does not unduly affect wage rates for local workers and that migrants are covered by union rights.
Wage arrears rising: With more foreign investment in the SAR, the increasing use of sub-contractors and the use of less-protected migrant workers, wages arrears has become a common problem, especially in the construction sector.
However, the government refused to take a more active role in combating the problem and refused to include suggestions to criminalize non payment of wages in the new labour law.
In most wage arrears cases, workers stage unplanned protests to claim back pay rather than seek help from the labour bureau, because the procedure is lengthy and cumbersome.
According to the Civil Servants Union, a simple labour dispute could take one year to process by the labour bureau followed by another two years in court.
The majority of migrant workers cannot afford this timeframe and many leave within this period.
Denial of re-entry to Macau: Macau is believed to keep a black list of local workers who have supported local strikes and has denied entry to "trouble-makers", including the HK legislator and General Secretary of the HK Confederation of Trade Unions.
Many workers are employed in 'formal' workplaces such as factories, depots, mines or offices.
They usually have a contract of work and know who their employer is.
They are more likely to be organised in trade unions, and benefit from the collective bargaining agreements between their union and management.
Their rights are laid down in national legislation, even if not fully upheld.
This is often called the 'informal sector'.
It is a large and growing proportion of the world's workforce.
Women and children are disproportionately employed here.
Trade unions are very weak, if organised at all.
In today's world of free market globalisation, many companies - large and small - have been ridding themselves of their formal workforce, with all the legal obligations and labour costs that this entails.
Some companies have casualised work contracts, hiring workers only for short periods even when the contract is repeated time and again.
Some put workers onto a part-time basis, especially where part-time workers have fewer legal rights
In such ways, the so-called 'formal' and 'informal' sectors are closely interlinked.
Governments have contributed to this shift towards 'informal' labour.
They have been privatising and 'outsourcing' work previously done by their own employees to sub-contractors with part-time or casual workers.
They have been weakening protective labour legislation, claiming that employers need this 'flexibility'.
'Flexibility' to workers, by contrast, usually means more insecurity, lower wages and poorer working conditions.
Many migrant workers have work permits and are part of the formal labour force.
But there are untold numbers of others who do not, for a wide variety of reasons.
These undocumented, hidden or clandestine workers are at the mercy of unscrupulous employers.
They are vulnerable to abuse and desperately poorly paid.
They often work in hazardous, even illegal conditions.
People can be found working in their own homes, often assembling goods, using machinery and parts supplied to them by a local factory.
Homeworkers, the vast majority of whom are women, are another hidden and vulnerable group of workers.
Very often they are not recognised as workers at all.
They are usually paid below legal minimum wages and do not get paid holidays, sick leave or other benefits.
They often have no work contract, which means they can be easily victimised by being denied work.
Being scattered in their own homes, they can find it very difficult to organise.
"The low terms and conditions of 'informal' workers are being used to undermine the higher standards achieved by trade unions for workers in the 'formal' workforce.
Whether by recruiting them into our trade unions or by working together with their associations, organising these vulnerable workers has become crucial to the fight to maintain working standards for all.

2008 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Hong Kong SAR (China)
2007 marks the 10th anniversary of the handover of Hong Kong from British to Chinese sovereignty.
In the past decade, little has changed in terms of legislation on working conditions and trade unionism.
Despite some protection provided by the labour laws, workers and unions continue to have little opportunity to defend their rights in practice.
Collective bargaining rights are regularly ignored.
Workers cannot bargain for a reasonable salary to compete with inflation.
Real wage levels of local low-skilled workers are continuing to decline, thereby aggravating the growing problems facing the "working poor".
The Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions, one of the ITUC Hong Kong affiliates, and community groups are still facing prosecution for campaigning in support of a compensation claim by hundreds of workers affected by cadmium exposure.
Although the Basic Law, which is the Constitution of Hong Kong, contains provisions guaranteeing freedom of association, the right to organise and the right to strike, no laws have been implemented to secure the effective application of these fundamental rights.
The Employment and Labour Relations Ordinance (ELRO) was introduced in 1997 specifically to repeal the laws brought in immediately prior to Hong Kong's reunification with China, which had been designed to implement the ILO core conventions.
The ordinance withdrew the right to collective bargaining while retaining the basic right of workers to form trade unions.
Two conditions apply to the formation of a union: a minimum number of seven members at the union's inception, and the union must be registered under the Trade Union's Ordinance.
The ELRO includes provisions to protect workers against dismissal for trade union activities but does not offer any remedies for individuals who have been subjected to other forms of anti-union discrimination.
Lack of protection for strikers: The right to strike is permitted by law.
According to the Public Order Ordinance, a "notice of no objection" is required from the police seven days in advance (24 hours for emergencies) in order to stage an assembly or protest.
It also authorises the use of force to break up strike pickets and demonstrations.
Employers can also seek an Injunction Order to suppress workers protests.
Many employment contracts stipulate that absence from work may lead to dismissal and strikers have little protection.
In April 2001, the government introduced amendments to the Employment Ordinance that ostensibly increased the protection of workers against dismissal for participating in strikes.
However, the amendments only ensure that, were a worker to be dismissed for strike action, he or she would have the right to sue the employer for compensation.
There is still no legal entitlement to reinstatement, even if a worker is found to have been unfairly dismissed for participating in a strike.
The Labour Advisory Board (LAB) had agreed in principle to laws giving the Labour Tribunal the power to order the reinstatement of unfairly dismissed workers without the consent of the employer.
However, the government has taken no further action on this, and no time frame for implementation has been stipulated.
Bargaining not recognised: The law still does not guarantee the right to collective bargaining.
The HKSAR government has persistently refused to implement the recommendations of the ILO Committee of Freedom of Association (CFA) on introducing legislation for the objective recognition of trade unions for the purpose of collective bargaining.
Limitation on use of funds: The ELRO restricts the freedom of a trade union to manage and use its funds as it wishes, particularly the use of funds for political ends or for transfer to foreign trade union organisations.
Eligibility for trade union office restricted: Only persons actually or previously employed in the trade, industry or occupation of the trade union concerned are permitted to become trade union officers.
The ILO has on several occasions urged the HK SAR government to relax the conditions on eligibility of trade union officials and the restrictions on the use of union funds as mentioned above.
High cost of labour litigation: There is a labour tribunal to deal with labour disputes.
But litigation can prove prohibitively expensive and time consuming.
Many judgments are not enforced and legal aid for such cases is difficult to obtain.
Trade union rights in practice and Violations in 2007
No recognition of collective bargaining rights: Collective bargaining is neither promoted nor encouraged by the authorities, and employers generally refuse to recognise unions.
Although almost 25 per cent of the workforce is unionised, unions are not strong enough to force management to engage in collective bargaining.
Thus, less than one per cent of workers are covered by collective agreements, and those that exist are not legally binding.
The Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions (HKCTU) is consistently excluded from the LAB, the tripartite consultative body established by the government, unlike pro-government and pro-Beijing union federations.
This exclusion means that the HKCTU is denied the right to participate in tripartite negotiations on labour laws and policy and excluded from bodies such as the Committee on the Implementation of International Standards, which reports to the ILO.
Consultation rather than bargaining: The government has consistently claimed that there is no need for collective bargaining rights in the public sector because the administration "consults" civil servants over their pay and conditions.
However, recent civil service reforms, involving transfers, reductions in wages and benefits, retrenchment and contracting-out to the private sector, have demonstrated very clearly that the government is free to act unilaterally without consulting the affected civil servants.
The introduction of legislation on wage cuts of civil servants is a self-evident example.
Minimum wage: In the past few years, the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions has been coordinating a campaign to fight for a minimum wage.
The government has been resisting these efforts and instead has formed a voluntary "wage protection movement" (WPM).
Under the WPM, participating corporations are encouraged to offer cleaning workers and security guards wages not lower than the relevant average market rates and enter into written employment contracts.
Trade unions and labour groups argue rightly that this "movement" is a sham, offering employees little protection, and that it allows the government to continue to resist efforts to discuss the introduction of a minimum wage amid the business sector's talk of a minimum wage "destroying Hong Kong's "competitiveness".
Metal Construction workers on strike – government refuses to negotiate except with pro-Beijing union: Around 2,000 bar benders working on various construction sites in Hong Kong went on strike on 6 August 2007 in protest against low wages and long working hours.
More than two decades ago, workers, in order to avoid competition amongst themselves, agreed to set a standard wage for their trade.
However, employers wanted to ensure a stable supply of workers and agreed with the small Hong Kong Construction Industry Bar-bending Workers' Union (BWU) to hold annual wage negotiations.
Daily wages have, however, dropped from HKD 1,300 in 1997 to the present rate of HKD 800, and many workers were employed on rates of only 500 HKD a day.
The BWU, an affiliate of the pro-Beijing Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions that has avoided pushing for wage increases and increased benefits, postponed the annual negotiations, and this triggered a strike amongst fears of continued salary stagnation or reductions.
The strike lasted over 36 days – one of the longest ever in recent Hong Kong history – and garnered massive public support.
It also revealed very publicly the differences between the pro-government Federation of Trade Unions and the Confederation of Trade Unions.
The BWU criticized the workers for striking and initially refused to support them, so the HKCTU stepped in to negotiate.
However, the government refused to negotiate with the HKCTU and the elected worker representatives.
This led to a complaint from the ITUC calling for the government to negotiate.
Eventually, the BWU was allowed to negotiate alongside the HKCTU, and a pay deal was reached that was only a modest success in terms of the pay demands but crucially gave the workers their shorter eight hour day – a long-term demand.
The settlement is the first genuinely negotiated industry-wide collective agreement in Hong Kong.
Cleaner sacked after giving evidence to sue employer: A cleaner employed by Cheung Kee Environmental Limited Company was dismissed in November 2006 after giving evidence to sue the employer for not granting statutory holidays.
The Cleaning Service Industry Workers Union, a HKCTU affiliate, helped the worker file a complaint to the Labour Department.
The department then filed a lawsuit prosecuting the company for unfair dismissal.
On 4 October 2007 the Magistrate gave a ruling that the company was acquitted of the charges, as the prosecution had failed to prove that the sacking of the cleaner was a result of him assisting in an investigation.
The Labour Department refused to file an appeal to higher court.
Unions threatened with legal action for defending workers: Trade union and labour groups in Hong Kong, including the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions (HKCTU), faced retaliation for their campaign to support workers suffering from cadmium poisoning.
The workers were involved in the production of batteries for Gold Peak Industries at its Huizhou factories in mainland China.
Other poisoning cases have also been reported in Hong Kong production facilities.
Efforts to petition the authorities led to warnings from management and the Huizhou government, including threats of prosecution.
A compensation fund was established in August 2005 but was so poorly managed that by mid-2006, according to Gold Peak's own statements, only four percent of the 400 workers affected by cadmium had received funds.
In June 2006, Gold Peak, through its lawyers, wrote to the groups who had signed and supported a postcard campaign, threatening them with legal action unless they made an official apology and an immediate payment of HKD 500,000 damages.
Gold Peak followed up with a summons to three groups involved: the HKCTU, Globalisation Monitor and the Neighbourhood and Workers' Service Centre.
The case against the three groups is still active today but Gold Peak has made no further arrangement to fix a date for a formal court hearing since September 2007 – the last exchange of legal documents between the two sides.
Cathay Pilots still fighting unfair dismissal: Pilots at Cathay Pacific Airways are still fighting for their rights.
Fifty-two pilots were sacked in 2001 after they took industrial action in a dispute over pay and working hours.
One pilot was subsequently reinstated.
Among the 51 that were not reinstated, there were eight trade union committee members and four union negotiators.
A deal was brokered in 2005 that enabled 19 pilots to apply for new jobs at the bottom of the seniority list with vastly reduced pay; only 12 were offered jobs.
A further 19 continued legal actions with one being successful in the UK in 2006 and the remainder still awaiting court proceedings in HK at the end of 2007.
2008 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - China
Despite the promises made concerning human rights improvements in the run up to the Olympics, workers found themselves detained or arrested, charged and imprisoned for their involvement in collective protest action during the year in the People's Republic of China.
Workers are prevented by law from organising outside the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU), which is bound by its constitution to accept the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).
The Trade Union Law bans workers from organising independently.
No freedom of association: China's Trade Union Law was adopted in 1950.
It was amended in 1992 and again in October 2001.
Workers are not free to form or join the trade unions of their choice.
Only one "workers'" organisation is recognised in law, the All China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU).
According to the revised version of the law, "the ACFTU and all organisations under it represent the interests of the workers and safeguard their legitimate rights".
Trade unions must also "observe and safeguard the Constitution (...), take economic development as the central task, uphold the socialist road, the people's democratic dictatorship, leadership by the Communist Party of China, and Marxist-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory (...) and conduct their work independently in accordance with the Constitution of trade unions".
Among their basic duties and functions, trade unions shall "coordinate labour relations through consultation", "mobilise workers to strive to fulfill their tasks in production" and "educate them in the ideological, ethical, professional, scientific, cultural and other areas, as well as self-discipline and moral integrity".
The law also gives trade unions ample prerogatives in various areas such as "democratic management and supervision" (see below).
Trade union monopoly: Article 10 of the law establishes the ACFTU as the "unified national organisation".
Under Article 11, the establishment of any trade union organisation, whether local, national or industrial, "shall be submitted to the trade union organisation at the next higher level for approval".
Trade union organisations at a higher level "shall exercise leadership" over those at lower level.
The law also empowers the ACFTU to exercise financial control over all its constituents.
Collective bargaining: There is currently no law governing collective bargaining procedures, only regulations on collective contracts.
However, if a collective contract is established in line with the regulations, it is legally binding.
The 1992 Trade Union Law first authorised unions at the enterprise level to conclude collective contracts and the Labour Law (effective 1995) developed the system by adopting collective consultation as a key medium for settling disputes between employers and workers.
Article 33 of the Labour Law states that workers have the right to conclude a collective contract "in an enterprise where the trade union has not yet been set up".
The amended Trade Union Law of 2001 again strengthened the union's mandate in collective wage negotiations as do regulations issued in 2000 and 2001.
A 2004 government "white paper" on employment encourages the ACFTU to conclude "collective contracts" in order to protect workers' rights, and the labour law permits collective consultation and contracts to be concluded between the ACFTU (or workers representatives) and the management.
According to ACFTU statistics for 2006, the number of collective contracts signed across the country reached 862,000, up 108,000, or 14.3%, on the figures for 2005.
The number of sectoral level collective contracts is unknown.
The majority of contracts still appear to be formulaic repetitions of articles from the Chinese labour law and to reflect minimum legal requirements, and many cover too few areas of concern to be of much use to workers.
Developments at the provincial level: The Shanghai Collective Contract Rules (the "Shanghai Rules"), adopted in August 2007, came into effect in January 2008.
To summarise, the Shanghai Rules provide for procedures and legal requirements governing three major areas: 1) collective bargaining; 2) collective contracts; and 3) related dispute resolution.
The new rules provide that collective bargaining shall accomplish the formulation, amendment or adoption of company policies, rules or major decisions directly affecting the following employee interests: (i) salary and wage; (ii) working time; (iii) leave and holidays; (iv) occupational safety and hygiene; (v) social insurance and benefits; (vi) employee training; (vii) labour discipline; (viii) production quotas; and (ix) other matters as required by law.
The rules stipulate the composition of bargaining teams and provide for the engagement of third party professionals.
Bargaining is made mandatory in cases where (i) a company must lay off more than 20 employees or more than 10 percent of its employees; (ii) a labour dispute has resulted in a mass strike or petition to the authorities; or (iii) something in the production process that has the potential to cause major accidents or work hazards has been detected.
The Shanghai Rules also set guidelines for regional or industry-specific union organisations to engage in collective bargaining with companies in construction or food-service businesses for the conclusion of regional or industry-specific collective contracts.
The Shanghai Rules also mandate the City of Shanghai to establish a tripartite system for the coordination and resolution of employment relationships and labour disputes.
Upper-level union organisations are given the discretionary power to oversee the collective bargaining activities of companies within their jurisdiction.
A union has the right to make a claim under the law against a company in breach of a collective contract, where this infringes the rights and interests of its employees.
A union may also apply for arbitration or file a lawsuit if efforts have failed to resolve, through coordination, a dispute arising from the performance of a collective contract.
New Labour Contract Law: In June 2007 the Labour Contract Law was adopted with effect from 1 January 2008.
The Law addresses some of the crucial failings of the current labour law and provides specific penalties and remedies for failing to observe labour laws and regulations.
It seeks to determine and clarify the nature of the employment relationship between workers and employers and stipulates aspects which must appear in a labour contract, such as the contract's duration, the job description, hours of work and rest, remuneration, social insurance and labour protection.
The new law also contains special rules relating to collective contracts, dispatched workers and part time work.
It includes penalties for companies which fail to provide proper written contracts, and penalties for breaking contract terms.
The law also appears to bolster the role of trade unions in discussions on redundancies and other major changes and it is clear that individual contracts cannot be used to undercut the levels of remuneration and working conditions established under collective contracts.
Protections for part-time workers are limited; hourly wages should not be set at levels below the minimum rates established by local government yet there is no requirement to give either notice or financial compensation in the event of termination.
Right to strike not protected under the law: The right to strike was removed from China's Constitution in 1982, on the grounds that the political system in place had "eradicated problems between the proletariat and enterprise owners".
Despite expectations that the revised Trade Union Law would include the right to strike, the revised law skirts around the issue by stating (Article 27): "In case of a work-stoppage or a go-slow in an enterprise, the trade union shall represent staff and workers in consultation with the enterprise, institution or relevant party, and shall reflect the opinions and demands of staff and workers as well as raise solutions.
The enterprise or institution shall strive for a settlement with the reasonable demands made by the staff and workers".
Article 27 does not employ the term "strike"(bagong), but instead refers to instances of "work-stoppage" (tinggong) and "go-slows" (daigong).
There are increasing calls within China for legislation of the right to strike and continued academic debate on the issue.
In reality the number of strikes (both spontaneous and planned, but always without the official recognition of the union if there is one) is increasing.
In the past few years there have been a number of successful and sustained strikes involving large numbers of workers.
Several of these are detailed below.
Health and safety – stoppages allowed: Articles 46 and 47 of the new Work Safety Law, promulgated in November 2003, state that workers who encounter a situation at work that directly endangers their personal safety have the right to refuse orders which violate health and safety rules, and the right to stop work and leave the workplace.
The Chinese labour law (article 56) contains similar provisions.
The Trade Union Law (article 24) is far weaker and states that when a trade union finds that workers have been directed to work in unsafe conditions then the union "has the right to put forward proposals for a solution".
Dispute resolution: In the last decade, the government has made considerable efforts to create a dispute resolution system that involves three stages: mediation, arbitration and the courts.
The Labour Law assigns trade unions the roles of chairing enterprise-based "labour dispute mediation committees" and of participating as a member in tripartite "labour dispute arbitration committees" (LDAC), the latter being chaired by the local labour bureau.
In addition, a new law on Labour dispute arbitration and mediation was passed in December 2007 taking effect in May 2008.
The law is officially aimed at providing a "fair and timely" settlement of labour disputes.
It allows an enterprise to establish its own labour mediation committee to solve internal disputes at its own level.
Such a committee should include employees and management representatives.
The new law also attempts to reduce costs for workers, has increased the length of time allowed for the initiation of a case (from 60 days to 12 months) and is claimed to have streamlined the process – allowing more workers to start and end the process.
Officials reported that the new law would cover labour disputes concerning issues over collective contracts, pay, occupational injuries, compensation, working time, holidays, social insurance and pensions, among other things, and that the arbitration documents would carry legal standing.
According to official statistics, labour dispute arbitration organisations at various levels dealt with 1.72 million cases involving 5.32 million employees between 1987 and 2005, with a growth rate of 27.3 percent annually.
An increasing number of labour disputes end up in the law courts and it is too early to tell if the new law will reverse this trend.
Much of this is due to the under-resourcing of the LDACs and the labour bureaus, the unprofessional behaviour of LDAC personnel, the fact that many cases are refused or obstructed for the reasons given above and to the fact that employers take court decisions more seriously.
While many court cases are settled in favour of the workers, many settlements are never carried out and it is estimated that only around half of the workers involved received their promised compensation.
There is an ongoing year-on-year increase in collective cases being brought to court or to arbitration, especially those of migrant workers.
This has implications for labour dispute settlement, as well as migrants' growing consciousness of their rights.
One 2005 study showed that the number of collective labour disputes nationwide increased more than five times, from 1,482 in 1994 to 11,000 in 2003 and almost double that in 2004 to around 20,000.
More than 410,000 workers were involved in the 19,000 collective actions in 2005.
A report by the ACFTU showed that in 2006 there were some 300,000 lawsuits against employers filed by workers reaching the courts – a reported rise of over 20 percent from 2005.
Over half of these cases were resolved in favour of the employees but in practice many court decisions are not implemented and the compensation awarded to the workers is never paid.
In part response to this in August 2006, a Supreme People's Court circular was issued directing courts to ensure that lawsuits filed by migrant workers over unpaid wages are dealt with and enforced in a timely manner.
Since the implementation of the Labour Contract Law on 1 January 2008, reports indicate that the number of arbitration cases filed in Guangzhou alone has risen dramatically.
60 percent of all cases involved non-payment of salaries and overtime.
According to reports, staffing in the arbitration committees remained low suggesting that the system is likely to quickly become overburdened and excessively slow.
International obligations: China has ratified neither of the two fundamental ILO Conventions on freedom of association, the right to organise and to bargain collectively (ILO Conventions 87 and 98).
The Chinese government has also not ratified core ILO conventions No.
29 and No.
105 regarding forced labour.
In February 2001, it ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), but announced at the same time that provisions guaranteed under Article 8,1 (a) of the Covenant, namely the right to establish and join workers' organisations of one's own choosing, would be dealt with in accordance with Chinese law.
In doing so, the government effectively entered a reservation concerning a fundamental element of the Covenant, thereby putting itself in breach of internationally recognised principles on the law of treaties.
It did not, however, enter any such reservation concerning Article 8, 1 (d) of the covenant, which guarantees the right to strike.
In April and May 2005, the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which monitors State parties' compliance with the ICESCR, examined the first report submitted to it by China following its ratification of the Covenant.
In its "Concluding Observations", the Committee "regretted" China's "prohibition of the right to organise and join independent trade unions".
It also "urged" China "to amend the Trade Union Act to allow workers to form independent trade unions outside the structure of the All China Federation of Trade Unions.
In 2006, China ratified ILO Convention 111 concerning Discrimination in Respect of Employment and Occupation.
In January 2007 the Chinese authorities ratified ILO Convention 155, the Occupational Safety and Health Convention.
Trade union rights in practice and Violations in 2007
Role of the official Chinese trade union (ACFTU) and new developments: The ACFTU has a monopoly as the country's sole official and legal trade union that assists the government in the primary task of ensuring social stability during the economic changes in Chinese industry, while also representing the demands of workers resulting from the multiple problems and inequalities emerging in the new "socialist market economy".
As a result, it actively calls on employers to follow the labour law, while at the same time urging workers to better equip themselves with knowledge of the law.
In keeping with the nationwide emphasis on the development of a "harmonious society" and in particular of a "harmonious workplace", the ACFTU has been promoting its role in the development of a harmonious and stable society.
At the Fifth Session of the 14th ACFTU Executive Committee held on 12-14 December 2007, ACFTU Chairman Wang Zhaoguo "emphasised that the broad masses of workers and union cadres should make greater contributions to scientific development and social harmony.
He called on trade unions at all levels to earnestly perform their duty of protecting workers' legal rights and interests, ... called on trade unions to carry out the principle of "organise the unorganised and fight for labour rights" in real earnest ... "
There is little doubt that the organisation is under huge pressure to meet the government's target of avoiding a repeat of the large-scale collective action that took place in northeast China during the spring of 2002 and to help stem the increasing rise of "mass protests".
Several new policies were decided at the 14th Congress in 2003, including direct trade union elections of enterprise-level branch Chairpersons and the opening of the union to migrant workers, whose formal status as farmers previously excluded them.
According to the ACFTU, about 29.5 million migrants had joined by July 2006 and by the end of September 2007, 61.97 million migrant workers had been admitted into trade unions across China, making up about 51.6% of the total number of migrant workers.
If correct, these figures represent a remarkable increase.
In the latter part of 2007, there was a spate of reports of mass layoffs of long term employees by Chinese and foreign enterprises in the run up to the implementation of the new Labour Contract Law.
In December the ACFTU issued a circular to safeguard employees' legitimate rights and interests, urging the resolute correction of actions such as forced resignations and re-signed labour contracts.
The ACFTU's circular stated that these types of activities by employers in violation or evasion of the labour laws "impacted negatively on building a socialist harmonious society".
It also asked all unions to "search out actions by employers that violate existing labour laws and regulations, or evade the Labour Contract Law in violation of employees' rights, and resolutely demand their rectification.
The need for the ACFTU to achieve a far greater level of unionisation in private enterprises and in particular in transnational companies and foreign owned corporations was again emphasised throughout the year.
In March 2006, China's President Hu Jintao reportedly issued instructions on a policy document – "A Situation Analysis on the Factors of Instability in Foreign-invested Enterprises in China's Coastal Area, and Some Proposed Countermeasures".
Hu Jintao was reported to have ordered the ACFTU specifically to do "a better job of building Party organisations and trade unions in foreign-invested enterprises".
Following this, the ACFTU instructed its staff to set the target of unionising over 60 percent of foreign invested enterprises by the end of 2006.
The target was subsequently raised to 80 percent for 2007.
According to an ACFTU spokesperson, this target was fulfilled with ACFTU branches in 60 percent of the 51,728 foreign-funded firms by the end of 2006 and by mid 2007 some 1.25 million trade unions had been set up in private firms.
Other official sources give higher figures.
In March 2007, Chinese media reported that KFC, McDonalds and Pizza Hut were paying illegally low wages to their part-time and casual "work-study" students in Guangzhou.
One observer stated that in return for not pursuing the matter, the companies agreed with the ACFTU to allow the ACFTU to establish union branches and two months later some six new branches had been reported.
KFC was also accused of trying to control the establishment of the new unions by establishing "trade union small groups" after organising a management led union at its headquarters in cooperation with the Hubei Province ACFTU.
At least one local trade union attempted to establish its own independent structure in Shiyan city but management has reportedly been pressuring workers to resign from this union and to join the formal and KFC operated one.
So far the higher level ACFTU authorities have not intervened.
Support for workers' grievances: Where detailed reports of social unrest are available, the role of the official trade union is often questioned by the workers concerned.
At local level, ACFTU officials usually do not support or recognise independent workers' action.
Their dual function as upholders of the Party and representatives of the working class puts them in a difficult position to defend workers' interests in the face of massive restructuring in the state sector and investor-friendly policies in the private sector.
With regard to the welfare and protection of the millions of workers who have been dismissed in this restructuring process, the impact of the ACFTU in negotiating and enforcing any social safety provisions that may have been obtained appears to be limited.
The privatisation of state, or other collectively-owned assets, frequently goes hand in hand with the corruption of local and regional government officials, over whom the ACFTU appears to have no influence.
It should be noted, however, that, while major labour unrest is generally not reported inside China, smaller collective actions increasingly are, thanks chiefly to the initiatives of workers and the courage of individual journalists and editors.
One 2004 survey of migrant workers in the Pearl River Delta revealed that while many migrants interviewed suffered from severe work injuries, only 1.9% reported that they had received attention from the ACFTU – a figure lower that the 4.5 percent who reported attention from the government.
A recent large-scale national survey showed that only 23.5% of the migrant workers interviewed reported the existence of trade unions in their enterprises and also stated that when their legal rights are infringed, only 4.2 percent would seek assistance from the trade union.
However while there is little evidence of actual ACFTU involvement in disputes, in October 2007 the ACFTU issued new measures aimed at protecting the rights of enterprise level trade union officers and establishing "cadre rights guarantee funds".
Trade union elections: Although the Trade Union Law states that trade union officers at each level should be elected, this is often ignored and most officials are appointed.
Many provinces are now developing regulations on union elections.
Elected candidates are subject to approval by the provincial-level ACFTU committees.
The majority of workers, if aware of the existence of a branch union, have little idea if their chairperson has been elected or not.
In many cases workers, are simply unaware that they have a trade union.
A 2006 survey, by the Chinese Institute of Industrial Relations, of the chairpersons of 1,811 trade unions in state-owned enterprises found that the Party was still appointing 24.5 percent of the chairs of state-owned enterprise trade unions.
In cases where chairs assumed their posts through election or open selective examinations, 35.1 percent of them participated in the election or examinations after the Party recommended them.
The vast majority of chairs, regardless of how they were appointed were party members or officials.
In addition, 72.1 percent of those questioned stated that their union committee had also established a Party group or branch at the workplace.
Many provinces have developed, or are in the process of developing, regulations concerning the obligation to hold trade union elections stipulated in Article 9 of the Trade Union Law which affirms the principle that: "Trade union committees at various levels shall be democratically elected at members' assemblies or members' congresses.
" The Guangzhou municipality passed a regulation, due to take effect in January 2008, stating that company managers were barred from holding union positions.
Membership: True membership levels are difficult to assess and many reports appear to be inconsistent.
According to "China Daily", at the end of 2005 the ACFTU had some 1.17 million grass roots unions and around 151 million members.
Other sources state that the ACFTU saw an "unprecedented" six percent rise in membership in the first six months of 2006 leading to a membership of 160.32 million, including some 2.58 million new members working with foreign companies.
The ACFTU then released figures in 2007 which stated that by the end of September 2006 the number of Chinese grassroots trade union organisations had reached 1.324 million, and the number of union members had reached 170 million.
The ACFTU Vice-Chair Sun Chunlan stated that the ACFTU was expecting 200 million workers to have enrolled as trade union members by July 2008, when the 15th National Congress of China's Trade Unions is scheduled.
However, it should be noted that legal procedures for registering a union office in an enterprise can be completed without trade union officials even entering the workplace, and branches can be set up in some enterprises simply by carrying out administrative procedures.
Under the current Trade Union Law, (Article 10), a basic-level trade union committee shall be set up in an enterprise, an institution or a government department with a membership of 25 or more.
Where the membership is less than 25, a basic-level trade union committee may be separately set up, or a basic-level trade union committee may be set up jointly by the members in two or more work units, or an organiser may be elected, to organise the members in various activities.
" This would essentially leave it up to the workers to establish a union and does not require all units to automatically establish a union.
For several years some companies – most publicly Wal-Mart – have stated that they are not stopping unions from existing but that the workers had not yet expressed the wish to establish one.
To counter this argument, in July 2006 ACFTU Chair, Wang Zhaoguo, proposed an amendment to the Trade Union Law that would require foreign enterprises to establish ACFTU-affiliated branches and that the establishment of unions depends on the "will" of the workers.
All attempts to establish independent trade unions repressed: No independent trade unions are allowed to exist, and all attempts at establishing independent workers' organisations are repressed, sometimes violently.
According to informal statements there exist two forms of illegal trade unions in China; the first where workers are unaware of the need to register with the ACFTU and the second where "hostile forces" incite workers to set up unions to overthrow the system.
The former are educated and assimilated into the ACFTU while the latter are cracked down upon.
Organisers of worker groups or protests are often arrested.
Some are sentenced to terms of imprisonment (officially called "reform through labour", or "lao gai") after criminal trials which fall well short of international standards.
Others can be assigned to terms of "re-education through labour" ("lao jiao", sometimes called "rehabilitation through labour"), an administrative process which bypasses the few safeguards of the criminal justice system.
The fear of detention also makes negotiations between workers' representatives and the authorities and employers extremely difficult.
Nevertheless, there has been a marked trend of worker organisers being prepared to take this risk.
Collective bargaining remains ineffective: The majority of provinces have implemented laws and regulations providing for the implementation of a collective contract system, including regulations governing regional and industry-specific collective contracts.
The ACFTU reported that there were more than 800,000 collective contracts in place, covering 1.5 million enterprises by the end of 2007.
Despite this, collective bargaining remains severely handicapped by the non-existence of truly independent organisations on either side.
Almost all contracts are drawn up by employers and simply reflect minimum legal requirements.
The subordinate position of the ACFTU to the government and the Party means that it will often work with the employer in drawing up collective agreements which simply mirror the labour law.
There is very little actual bargaining and in fact the Chinese term employed is "collective consultation" rather than "collective bargaining" although the new Labour Contract Law appears to favour the term bargaining over consultation .
Very often workers are offered no formal contract at all, especially migrants in export processing zones (EPZs).
If they do sign a contract, they are rarely given a copy.
ACFTU officials have been quoted as opposing wage increases in order to avoid triggering other demands for similar deals.
Despite this, some provinces are enacting specific collective contract regulations which, if properly implemented may improve the contract negotiation process and the quality and scope of the resulting contracts.
For example Hebei province implemented new Regulations on Enterprise Collective Consultations between Labour and Management which state that the consultation process should give equal weight to the interests of the enterprise and the workers.
According to one commentary the regulations explicitly state that where there is no trade union in the enterprise, the workers' representatives in the negotiations should be "democratically elected by a majority of employees.
" Where there is a union, representatives should be recommended (tuijian) by the union, and scrutinised by the workers' congress.
The new regulations continue to use somewhat vague language regarding the legal duty to engage in open and equal negotiations.
Unpaid wages and increasingly low wages and poor working conditions were the other major source of protests in 2007 and especially of the often smaller but more frequent protests, strikes and sit-ins by workers at privately owned enterprises.
In early 2006, the PRC Ministry of Public Security announced that more than 87,000 "mass social disturbances" had occurred in 2005, up 6 per cent from 2004 and 50 per cent from 2003.
More than 3.7 million people were involved in such incidents in 2004.
The figures were widely quoted in the foreign media and since then similar national figures have not been widely reported.
Many mass disputes were about land seizures in rural areas, about half of which were labour-related.
The report states that there were over 1,000 strikes involving factories with more than 100 workers in 2005 in Guangdong Province alone.
According to an ACFTU scholar, 60 per cent of protests are work-related and their number is increasing by 30 percent a year.
Statistics announced in December 2007 by China's National Bureau of Statistics revealed that in 2006 public security bodies handled 599,392 cases involving "disturbances of social order", "disturbances in public spaces", "trouble-making activities" or "obstruction of public service execution.
"
On strike for trade union rights: Several hundred workers at the Yantian International Container Terminals (YICT), a major southern Chinese port went on strike over low pay and to demand the creation of a trade union in April 2007.
An earlier strike was also reported in March.
The strike was ended after management reportedly agreed to raise wages by three percent and to allow workers to organise a union.
Detention of strikers and protestors: While the Labour Law, Trade Union Law and Occupational Safety and Health Law make mention of "work-stoppages", workers who put these vaguely-worded provisions to the test are likely to face a host of problems.
They are usually picked up by the police and warned about public order offences, traffic violations, breaking the law on parades and demonstrations, or much more serious political charges.
Strike organisers and independent labour activists also face the threat of re-education through labour, a form of administrative detention.
Though in principle limited to three years, in practice these periods of forced labour can be extended at the authorities' will.
Crackdown on legal aid groups for workers: The past few years have seen a constant increase in the number of workers using the courts as way of achieving redress for unpaid wages, missing benefits or other issues.
A parallel growth in the legal field has seen a rise in the number of lawyers taking on civil litigation cases, including labour rights cases.
Increasingly such lawyers are being blacklisted, banned from practice and in some cases imprisoned for their work.
The ACFTU has also begun some work on the provision of legal aid for workers involved in labour disputes.
However some have stated that the aim is to prevent workers from organising or relying on local labour groups in order to maintain limits on the influence of such groups.
Medical concerns and deaths: In addition to concerns over Hu Shigen and Kang Yuchun, fears continue over the deteriorating health of Yao Fuxin, who was sentenced in May 2003 to seven year's imprisonment, along with Xiao Yunliang, for their part in the mass protests in Liaoyang in March 2002.
The health of both men deteriorated during their imprisonment, after the prison authorities provided them with little or no medical care.
Despite repeated calls by their families and protests by the international trade union movement and despite the clear legal basis for their release, medical parole was denied to Yao and Xiao.
In February 2006, Xiao Yunliang was released three weeks ahead of completing his sentence.
The ACFTU failed to provide any response to repeated calls by the international trade union movement that it intervene on their behalf.
Zhang Shanguang, a teacher from Hunan and a veteran independent labour activist and former prisoner was sentenced to ten years in 1998 on charges of "threatening the security of the State" after attempting to set up an independent trade union.
There have been repeated reports that Zhang has been ill-treated and tortured.
Shao Liangchen, a leading member of the Ji'nan Workers' Autonomous Federation in Shandong Province and originally sentenced to death, then reprieved, was diagnosed with leukaemia in 2004 and passed away in late 2005, two days after having been released on medical parole.
Continued imprisonment for activists: Many labour and trade union activists sentenced in previous years, as reported in previous versions of the Survey, remained in custody.
They include: Li Bifeng, Zhao Changqing, Li Wangyang, He Chaohui, Chen Wei, Huang Xiangwei, Li Jianfeng, Lin Shun'an, Lin Shuncheng, Lin Shunhan, Zhan Gongzhen, Zheng Xiaohua, Lin Chan, She Wanbao, Kong Youping, Nin Xianhua.
Lu Wenbin, Hu Mingjun, Wang Sen, Yue Tianxiang, Guo Xinmin, Wang Wanxing, Gao Hongming, Xu Yonghai and Zha Jianguo.
Information on Ni Xiafei and Li Keyou has not been made public and it is assumed they remain in detention.
All had tried to protect workers' interests, by protesting or organising and representing workers.
According to new information, several releases of other workers involved in the 1989 protests have been made public.
These include Zhou Yan who was a 23-year-old worker at a Shanghai textile factory in 1989 when he was detained for infiltrating student and citizen organisations during the 1989 protests in order to gather intelligence for an unnamed foreign power and incite unrest.
Zhou was sentenced to life in prison for espionage.
In late 2007, it was reported that he had in fact been released in June 2006 after several sentence reductions.
In September 2006 a previously unknown factory worker detained during 1989, Zhang Maosheng was released after serving 17 years in prison for allegedly setting fire to a military vehicle in June 1989.
Du Hongqi and Li Yanying, two laid-off workers of the South China Industries Group had founded an underground trade union in September 2003 to fight for better working conditions and had organised several petitions and protests.
After the mass lay-offs, their union helped to voice the workers' demands for unemployment compensation and aid to find new jobs.
The leaders were subsequently apprehended.
Du was arrested on 8 December 2003 under the charge of "assembly to disturb social order".
In October 2004, he was tried and sentenced to three years' imprisonment.
Du is now believed to have been released.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Palestine
The exercise of freedom of association or collective bargaining remain extremely difficult for most Palestinians workers, especially in Gaza.
One trade union leader was sacked and another one detained.
Peaceful May Day demonstrations were broken up by soldiers.
The law does not yet cover all trade union rights.
While basic trade union rights are guaranteed, gaps remain in the labour law.
Palestinian workers, including public sector employees, may establish and join unions and engage in collective bargaining, although this is not yet enshrined in law.
Palestinians working in Jerusalem are governed by Israeli labour law, and they are free to form and join unions.
While the right to strike is recognised, unions must give four week's advance notice for strikes in public utilities.
Furthermore, the Ministry of Labour can impose arbitration, and trade unions can face disciplinary action if they do not accept the outcome of that arbitration.
A new trade union law is being drafted and includes the institutional framework for industrial relations, although it has been criticised by the Palestinian General Federation of Trade Unions (PGFTU).
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Background: The Israeli offensive against Hamas in late 2008 and early 2009 resulted in massive rebuilding costs for the Palestinian Authority and reduced the ability of Palestine to provide employment opportunities, further reducing its ability to pay its own officials.
Between 1,166 and 1,417 Palestinians and 13 Israelis were killed, while over 4,000 homes were destroyed and 600-700 factories and workshops were destroyed.
The current installation by Egypt of a new steel wall aimed at blocking the tunnels between Gaza and Egypt, through which a reported 60% of the economy in the Gaza Strip depends, will add to the economic desperation of most Palestinians and the potential for abuses.
In September, the Israeli Trade Union centre Histadrut confirmed its support for a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine.
Gaza has become a humanitarian crisis, with 80% of families relying on humanitarian aid, 95% of Gaza's industrial operations suspended, and unemployment at 50%, with most Palestinians being unable to leave Gaza to work in Israel.
Salaries of public sector employees are frequently delayed, as the transfer of funds has to come through Israel and major strikes occurred in the public sector after wages were delayed.
Difficult exercise of trade union rights in Gaza: Due to the political strife in Gaza between Hamas and Fatah, with each side describing any union activity as politically-motivated, any normal daily exercise of freedom of association or collective bargaining is extremely difficult.
Discrimination hinders organising of women workers: Women workers receive some 60% of the wages of their male counterparts, and wages are the lowest in sectors that are predominantly female, such as agriculture and services.
Security issues, legislative discrimination and cultural issues deter more women from entering the labour force.
Women make up less than 15% of employees in the Palestinian labour market according to the Palestine General Federation of Trade Unions (PGFTU), and most of them are unorganised.
Sackings and strikes at UN agency: On 5 and 14 February, United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East's (UNRWA) employees went on strike demanding pay increases similar to Palestinian Authority and UN workers in other countries.
In April, following internal trade union elections involving around 10,000 workers, management warned it may fire employees who violated the organisation's non-partisan policy.
In late June, 312 workers from the West Bank were fired.
In response, large numbers of workers protested, with the support of the Palestinan General Federation of Trade Unions (PGFTU), and nearly 16,000 held a one-day strike.
An agreement was finally reached in December.
Peaceful May Day demonstrations broken up by Israel soldiers: On 1 May, a short march of workers in the West Bank organised by the Palestine General Federation of Trade Unions (PGFTU) to celebrate May Day was held at Mt.
Zayton in Jerusalem.
The activities were kept small and not publicised for fear of trouble.
Another march was held afterwards outside Bethlehem attended by some 250 people.
The marchers were stopped by a line of Israeli soldiers and vehicles that launched sound grenades and tear gas canisters into the crowd.
The canisters were fired directly at groups of workers, and an ambulance had to be called.
Three workers and a journalist were apprehended.
Health Workers Union leader sacked over complaints: In September, various transportation, teachers and health workers' unions demanded an urgent meeting with caretaker Prime Minister Salam Fayyad after the firing of the leader of the Health Workers Union.
Tensions had been rising between the Health Minister and unions over poor working conditions including the non-payment of overtime and transport costs.
Osama An-Najjar, head of the health professionals' union, accused the Health Ministry of "targeting union activities" and deliberately avoiding direct dialogue.
According to the union, An-Najjar was then fired and another official dismissed.
Health workers then went on strike.
In a radio interview, the Health Minister Fathi Abu Moghli called the strike illegal.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Israel
There were many strikes during the year in all sectors although the labour courts often issue back-to-work orders in various sectors.
Palestinian workers in Israel, even with permits, are hounded by the authorities and are often subject to abuse, illegal detentions and deportations while Israeli Arabs are subject to extensive employment-related discrimination.
Most employers breach the labour law, and the right to strike is coupled with restrictions.
Israeli workers are free to join and establish trade unions and have the right to organise.
However, a minimum of one third of the employees in a workplace is needed to form a union.
It is also forbidden to be a member of two unions at the same time.
While Palestinians who work in Israel enjoy freedom of association, they may not elect or be elected to trade union leadership bodies.
The right to strike is secured, but it is prohibited to strike over issues that are covered by a collective bargaining agreement in force.
All political strikes are also forbidden.
Furthermore, the government or authorised ministers may pass emergency measures to "defend the country", ensure public safety and guarantee the supply of "essential services".
Such measures, which can remain in force for up to three months, allow the government to impose severe penalties for failure to comply.
Finally, the government or a public employer can ask the labour courts to issue back-to-work orders to strikers.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Migrant workers admitted into Histadrut: In November, the Histadrut Legislative Assembly passed a motion which admits migrant workers as members with equal rights.
With this amendment in the constitution, the Histadrut will work as a trade union to promote the status, working conditions, and to protect the rights of migrant workers in Israel, based on the principles of equality and the Israeli law.
Previously, only Israeli citizens or residents could be members.
Histadrut also objected to the increasing deportation of the migrant workers' children and is calling instead for a solution.
A new union, Koach La Ovdim – literally "Power to the Workers" – had previously begun organising among migrant workers, in particular in non-organised sectors, contract work and temporary employment, such as security work, baggage handling, waiting and even lecturing.
Very poor respect of labour law: According to a 2006 report, 92% of employers breach the labour law.
The main victims are migrant workers and women.
In February 2008, the government approved a significant increase in the number of labour supervisors.
Problems for Palestinian workers: The ILO reports that there are 60,000 Palestinians working legally and illegally in Israel; these workers face serious daily problems with crossing borders between the West Bank and Gaza Strip and are sometimes harassed and humiliated by border guards.
In addition, some 20,000 Palestinians work in the West Bank for very low wages, and many are among the most marginalised people in Palestinian society, often widows or women with sick family members who fall through the gaps in the network of social solidarity that has enabled many Palestinians to survive the effects of the Israeli occupation.
The situation of these workers is exacerbated by the fact that often Israeli authorities abandon the Palestinian workers to their employers by not inspecting their working conditions, especially in the West Bank settlements.
Migrant workers abused and denied union rights: Migrant workers, who make up around 7% of the working population, have only restricted labour and trade unions rights.
They are often mistreated, threatened with deportation or deported when they complain or attempt to organise.
The rounding up and deportation of undocumented migrant workers has increased with the formation of a targeted immigration force and the economic crisis raising fears over local jobs.
Histadrut recently opened membership to migrants and has urged Israeli employers to grant migrant workers the same social and employment rights as their Israeli counterparts.
While the Israeli Labour Court has agreed that this principle should be applied, in practice abuse is still common.
Palestinian workers denied rights – suspended and dismissed after strike: In October, around 80 Palestinian workers, members of the Jahleen Bedouin tribe in the city of Ma'aleh Adumim, went on strike after their municipal employers refused to allow more workers to attend Friday prayers.
As a result the authorities ordered the dismissal of three employees, threatened three others with dismissal and suspended 14 other employees.
The gardening and sanitation workers come under locally applied Jordanian law, which is not extended to Palestinians.
Jordanian labour law was applied in the territories in 1965, and while recent amendments have made the legislation more progressive these amendments are not applied to Palestinians.
Lawyers filed a suit on their behalf at the regional labour court asking that Israeli labour law be applied, which would allow them restricted rights to strike as well as improved working conditions.
Palestinian textile workers abused: According to a November 2009 report, most workers from a textile factory in the Barkan Israeli industrial zone received 7 – 12 shekels an hour (approximately a third of the legal minimum wage).
Workers did not receive a pay slip, nor any medical or social benefits including overtime and holidays.
In April 2008, the Kav LaOved NGO helped 47 Palestinian workers from the Barkan factory to sue their employer in the Labour Court.
The complaints were also made to the management, the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Labour in Israel and the Civil Administration.
However, the authorities have not yet visited the factory nor made any response.
Several of the original complainants have been forced to drop their cases because they and their families could not afford not to work.
Chapter 2 of the Constitution provides for the protection of basic rights and liberties, including fundamental labour rights.
Under Sec.
18, the right under law to acquire one’s living through work or trade of his own choice is protected.
The promotion of employment and everyone’s right to work, as well as the protection of the labour force are duties imposed on the public authorities.
Everyone has the right not to be dismissed from work without lawful reasons.
The freedom to organise in trade unions (as a positive and a negative right) is regulated in Sec.
13 in connection with the right to arrange and participate in demonstrations.
These provisions are also considered to contain at least a basic guarantee for the right to strike.
The main function of the constitutional rights discussed here is to imply tasks for the public authorities.
However, the provision on job security has, in legal proceedings, been treated as an enforceable right for the individual.
The same applies to the rules of Sec.
6, concerning equality and ban on discrimination, which are also considered to have a horizontal effect between private parties.
The structure and role of the Finnish labour regulation reflects many of the central features of the so called Nordic model of industrial relations.
Thus, the Finnish labour market is characterised by a high level of organisation on both the employee and the employer side, and an important role played by collective bargaining in labour regulation.
The basis of the regulation lies, however, in comprehensive and detailed labour legislation which is complemented by collective agreements.
It is common for statutory rules to allow derogation by means of collective agreements, usually concluded between national federations of employers and employees.
The impact of collective negotiations has evolved mainly after the II World War.
Since Finland’s affiliation to the EEA Agreement in 1994 and joining the EC the following year, European integration has had a harmonising influence on the regulation as a whole.
The basic regulation of individual labour relations has in Finland traditionally been codified in a statute called the Employment Contracts Act.
The first Act bearing this name was passed 1922 and was replaced by the 1970 Act, which in turn has recently been repealed by the 2000 Statute (Act 55/2000, in force as from 1 July 2001).
The Employment Contracts Act provides for the definition of the employment contract, the ways of concluding and ending the contract, as well as the rules on job protection and a number of basic rights and duties of the parties regarding e.g.
equal treatment, transfer of undertakings, family leaves, payment of wages, and the determination of minimum terms of employment through generally applicable collective agreements or collective agreements which are to be observed by employers hiring out their workers.
Aspects of the individual labour relationship are regulated in separate statutes such as the Labour Safety Act (1958), the Annual Holidays Act (1973).
The Hours of Work Act (1996), The Study Leave Act (1979), and the Act on Equality between Men and Women (1986).
The collective regulation of terms and conditions of employment takes place within the framework of the Collective Agreements Act (1946) which defines the competence of parties to collective agreements and the legal effects of such agreements.
During a period not covered by an agreement the state may intervene in labour disputes of interest by virtue of the Mediation in Labour Disputes Act (1962).
Worker participation at the enterprise level is based on the Co-operation Within Undertakings Act (1978), the Act on the Representation of the Personnel in the Administration of Enterprises (1990), and the Act on Personnel Funds (1989).
The sources of labour law can be presented in a rough hierarchical order as follows:
2) Norms in a collective agreement which has been declared as generally applicable;
3) Norms in a collective agreement which is binding by virtue of the Collective Agreements Act;
7) Optional rules of law and provisions of collective agreements, i.e.
norms which allow derogation based on individual contracts;
Case law, especially the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court and the Labour Court, has an important role in clarifying the interpretation of the rules of labour law, and is thus commonly observed by other courts.
The regular courts may also ask the Labour Court for an advisory opinion in a case in which the application of a collective agreement is involved.
This usually takes place when the claim is based on a generally binding collective agreement, a situation where the jurisdiction is vested in the regular court.
As regards the interpretation of statutory labour law, a special tripartite body, the Labour Council, has been established to give advisory opinions to other courts and authorities at their request.
The practice of the EC Court is also observed in the national courts.
The Employment Contracts Act is applicable to several groups of workers engaged under both regular and atypical employment contracts.
Thus, part-time workers, fixed-term workers, home workers and workers of temporary employment firms are all covered by the definition of employment contract given in Chapter 1 Sec.
1 of the Act.
It is another matter that the Employment Contracts Act as well as a number of other statutes contain some specific provisions regulating the terms of employment of these workers.
Seafarers, household employees and apprentices are subject to somewhat more differing regulation.
The status of civil servants and certain other workers employed by municipalities and other public law units is distinguished from employment contract and subjected to the rules of public law.
There are only a few statutory rules regulating the operation of private temporary work agencies.
Such firms need not be licensed, but only reported to the labour inspectorate.
In addition, a TEA must give the labour inspection and manpower authorities regular information of its activities.
The user firms are equally subject to only few restrictions as regards the use of external workers supplied by a TEA.
Utilization of outside manpower is, however, a matter which must be handled in negotiations under the Cooperation Within Undertakings Act.
There are also collective agreements according to which the use of outside manpower should be limited for the levelling of work peaks or for special and temporary tasks which cannot be performed by the undertaking’s own staff.
The employment contract between a TEA and its worker is usually made on a fixed-term basis for each assignment.
According to a new rule adopted in Sec.
9, Chapter 2 of the Employment Contracts Act, workers hired to work for another employer under its authority enjoy certain basic protection even if their own employer, such as a TEA, is not bound by any collective agreement.
In this case the minimum terms of employment to be observed are normally those determined in the collective agreement applicable to the user undertaking.
The health and safety at work of temporary workers is protected under a Government Decree issued in 1997 to implement EC Directive 91/383.
An employment contract may be agreed to start with a trial period of not more that four months, or in some cases, six months (1:4 Employment Contracts Act).
If the contract is made for a fixed term shorter than eight months, only half of the contract term may consist of a trial period.
To be entitled to invoke a stipulation on a trial period coming from a collective agreement, the employer must individually inform the employee of the stipulation upon concluding the contract.
During the trial period, either of the parties may terminate the contract with immediate effect.
If the measure is taken by the employer, however, it may not be based on unfair grounds.
Termination of the contract of employment by means of notice is regulated in Chapter 7 of the Employment Contracts Act.
The formulations are partly new but the provisions mainly reflect the status of case law developed in the application of the 1970 Act and introduce only a few changes with the improvement of job security as their goal.
Further rules, related to rescinding the contract, are to be found in Chapter 8, while the termination procedure is governed by Chapter 9 of the new Act.
Provisions on terms of notice and some other general issues regarding termination are given in Chapter 6.
The grounds for individual termination are specified in Sec.
2 in which two types of reasons are described: serious violation or omission of the employee’s essential duties, and incapacity to work resulting from a change of conditions that belongs to the risks of the employee (e.g.
imprisonment). Save the most serious cases of misconduct, the employee must be provided with a warning and an opportunity to change his behaviour prior to the termination.
The employer must also ascertain whether or not the employee can be relocated in other work in the undertaking or within a group of undertakings controlled by the employer.
Sec. 2 further lists grounds which in no event can be considered to justify a termination, such as the employee’s illness which has not caused permanent disability to work, participation in an organized industrial action, or the employee’s political or religious opinions.
Under Sec.
3, a collective termination is justified if work has reduced for economic or production-related reasons or reasons connected with the reorganization of the firm’s activities, and the reduction is both substantial and permanent.
The employer’s relocation duty applies to collective dismissals as well.
Examples of unjustified grounds for dismissal are given also in Sec.
3. The situations envisaged here mainly relate to presumed cases of concealed individual terminations, such as reorganization of work which in fact has not resulted in a reduction of the work tasks.
If the employer within nine months after a collective termination needs manpower for similar work, such work shall in the first place be offered to former employees seeking work through the local Manpower Office.
The procedural rules on termination require that the employee shall be accorded an opportunity to be heard about the reasons for an intended rescission or an individual termination.
In cases of collective termination, the reasons and alternatives for the projected measure shall in good time be presented to the employees in question or to their representative.
Where the Cooperation Within Undertakings Act is applicable, the matter must be submitted to negotiations under that Act.
Further rules on the details of the termination procedure are given in Chapter 9 of the Employment Contracts Act and in collective agreements.
The effect of a termination is that the employment relationship ceases even when the termination is not justified.
Neither can the relationship be reinstated without the consent of both parties.
Instead, an employee who is illegally dismissed from work is entitled to compensation under the provisions of Chapter 12 of the Employment Contracts Act.
The compensation sum may amount to 24 month’s wages and is determined on the basis of a number of criteria, such as loss of earnings suffered by the employee, unemployment benefits awarded to compensate such loss, duration of the employment relationship, and degree of guilt found on the side of the employer.
An employee may terminate an employment contract, concluded for an indefinite period, by giving notice to his employer.
The notice period to be followed is 14 days or one month, depending on whether the employment relationship has lasted for five years or a longer time.
No grounds are required for such termination.
But if the employee intends to rescind the contract with immediate effect, he must be able to present an especially weighty reason for doing so.
Also in other respects the employee must follow the provisions which correspond to those which the employer must observe when rescinding the contract (Chapter 8 of the Employment Contracts Act).
According to Sec.
2 Chapter 12 of the Employment Contracts Act, if the contract is rescinded by the employee on grounds relating to the employer’s wilful or negligent action envisaged in Sec.
1, Chapter 8, the employee is entitled to compensation as if the contract had been unjustly terminated by the employer.
A specific provision on constructive dismissal in connection with a transfer of undertaking is included in Sec.
6, Chapter 7 of the Act.
In line with Art.
4(2) of the Transfer of Undertakings Directive, the employer is deemed liable if the employment contract is terminated due to a substantial change in working conditions to the detriment of the employee.
Under the Hours of Work Act, working time includes the time actually worked and the time the employee is obliged to be at the work-site at the disposal of the employer.
The maximum normal working time is eight hours a day and 40 hours a week.
The weekly limit may, however, be exceeded by means of a schedule, laid down by the employer in advance, providing for working hours not exceeding 40 a week on average over a period of 52 weeks.
The Act further provides for a number of alternative ways of arranging the normal working time within certain limits.
This is possible in branches, enumerated in Sec.
7 of the Act, where periodic work is allowed, and generally if the arrangement is agreed upon individually or, as the case may be, through a nation-wide collective agreement.
Working time arrangements based on collective agreements which in turn permit local deviations are quite common.
Night work, shift work, Sunday work as well rest periods are subject to rules and conditions which in the main follow the regulation in the Working Time Directive.
Overtime work presupposes the employee’s individual consent, given for every separate occasion or for a certain shorter period.
Overtime is allowed up to 138 hours within a period of four months, and up to 250 hours during a calendar year.
The yearly maximum can be exceeded with at most 80 hours on the basis of a local agreement.
Emergency work, necessitated by an accident or some other unforeseen circumstance, can be done for a period of two weeks at most regardless of any other limits set by law or agreement.
Overtime work and emergency work in excess of the normal daily hours of work shall be paid with time and a half for the first two hours and with double time for any extra hours.
If merely the normal weekly hours of work are exceeded, the hours so worked shall be paid with time and a half.
The compensation just explained may be replaced with corresponding paid free time, if so agreed.
The annual vacation shall normally be given as one continuous period during the holiday period of 2 May through 30 September.
However, the part of the vacation that exceeds four weeks may be given as a winter vacation.
Within these and certain other limits provided for in the Act, it rests with the employer to determine, upon hearing the opinion of the employee, the time of the vacation.
One of the exceptions to this main rule is that the employee has the right to save six days of his summer vacation to be used in later years.
In addition to their normal wage which under the Act is payable before the time of the vacation, employees are, according to most collective agreements, entitled to a vacation bonus, usually 50 per cent of the vacation pay.
As regards public holidays, a special Act has been passed in 1937 to guarantee that employees get their normal pay also on Independence Day, 6 December.
Should work be done on Independence Day, it is remunerated as Sunday work.
The same applies to work done on a number of Church festivals which have been transferred to Saturdays.
Some festival days, such as New Year’s Day, Good Friday and May Day, may coincide with usual working days, and for these cases collective agreements generally include provisions according to which employees are entitled to a full week’s wage in spite of the holiday.
The right to family leaves is regulated in Chapter 4 of the Employment Contracts Act.
Maternity, paternity and parental leave is granted for the period to which the corresponding benefit, governed by the Sickness Insurance Act (1963, as amended), is deemed to relate.
Thus, maternity leave normally begins 30 weekdays before the calculated date of confinement and lasts 105 weekdays.
Paternity leave is granted for 6 to 12 weekdays in connection with the confinement and for another 6 days at a later time.
Maternity leave is followed by a 158 weekdays’ parental leave, which can be used by the mother or the father according to their choice.
According a reform plan, which has already been agreed upon politically, one month of the parental leave will be reserved for the father only.
The benefit payable to the employee amounts to 70 per cent of the previous earnings at most.
Under the Employment Contracts Act, the employer has not duty to pay wages for the time of family leaves.
However, according to some collective agreements the employee is entitled to full pay for the first two or three months of the maternity leave.
Study leave is granted under the Study Leave Act (1979) to employees with at least one year’s full-time service with the same employer.
The leave may be taken for general, vocational, professional, or trade union education and training.
The maximum amount of study leave is two years in the course of five year’s service.
No wages are paid during the time of the study leave.
Furthermore, its is common that collective agreements provide for trade union courses and other educational leaves.
Professional courses arranged by the employer, as well as courses for workers’ representatives, generally include compensation for the time off.
Special protective measures, such as training, education and medical examination, must be taken by the employer in connection with the employment of a minor (Sec.
9-11 of the Act).
The regular working time of a young person over 15 is the same as that of an adult employee in the same kind of work.
As for overtime and emergency work, night work, shift work, and minimum daily rest, more restrictive conditions are prescribed in Sec.
4-8 of the Act.
Thus, no more than 80 hours of overtime work per calendar year is permitted (without dispensation) for a young worker, and the working hours may not exceed 9 per day and 48 per week.
The minimum daily rest is 12 consecutive hours and the minimum weekly rest is 38 hours, correspondingly.
The hours of work shall fall between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. The work of an employee under 15 is subject to even more far-reaching restrictions as regards working time.
The prohibition to discriminate on the ground of sex, age, origin, language, religion, conviction, opinion, health, disability or other such ground is laid down in Sec.
6 of the Constitution.
The prohibition is subject to the condition that there is no acceptable reason for different treatment.
The Employment Contracts Act, 2:2, repeats the main content of the provision, adding trade union activity to the list of grounds on which discrimination within the employment relationship is forbidden.
The discrimination ban must be observed also in hiring new employees.
Furthermore, the provision of the Employment Contracts Act imposes on the employer a duty to treat his employees impartially in other respects as well, unless an exception is warranted by justified reasons.
Besides prohibiting sex discrimination, the Act also imposes on the employer duties to promote equality.
He shall endeavour to have both women and men seeking jobs, try to create equal career opportunities, and adjust the working conditions suitable to both sexes (Sec.
6 and 6 a).
One of these positive obligations is the duty to ensure as far as possible that no employee is subjected to sexual harassment or derangement.
Non-fulfilment of this duty is regarded as a form of prohibited discrimination and may, as in the case of the other forms, render the employer liable to pay to the victim a pecuniary compensation which is normally adjusted between 15,600 - 51,900 FIM (ca.
2,600 - 8,700 EUR).
The supervision of the Equality Act is entrusted with the Equality Ombudsman and the Equality Delegation.
A major reform of the Equality Act is under way at the moment.
The amount of pay is not fixed directly by law in Finland.
Pay is normally determined in collective agreements or between parties to individual employment contracts.
The provisions on pay, included in the Employment Contracts Act, merely regulate the time, place and manner of payment and related issues.
However, the Act also provides for the general applicability of collective agreements and in this way forms a statutory basis for the regulation of minimum wage and other minimum terms and conditions of employment as well.
Within this system, even non-organized employers shall observe the minimum provisions of a collective agreement which has been declared as generally applicable in the field.
Should there be no collective agreement applicable to a particular work, and no stipulation on pay in the employment contract either, the Employment Contracts Act provides that “customary and reasonable wage” shall be paid (2:10).
Thus far there is no experience of the matter, and the application of the new provision can be expected to have only minor significance in practice.
One could assume that the criteria for reasonable wage would be found e.g.
in a collective agreement regulating similar type of work.
In case of dispute, the matter shall be brought before a regular court to be tried in normal order.
Trade union freedom, comprising also the right not to belong to an association or to resign from one, is guaranteed by the Constitution, the Employment Contract Act, and also the Criminal Code.
In addition, most collective agreements include clauses on freedom of association.
Employers are equally covered by the rules envisaged, and workers enjoy protection against actions taken by their fellow-employees as well.
The regulation in effect prohibits closed shop arrangements.
Trade unions as well as employers’ associations are governed by the general rules of the Associations Act (1989).
No specific pattern for trade unions is provided for.
A union gains legal personality upon registration which cannot be denied if the formal requirements are fulfilled.
The Finnish labour market is characterized by three dominating central confederations on the worker side.
The largest one is the SAK, the Central Organization of Finnish Trade Unions, representing nearly 1,100,000 wage-earners.
The member associations of the SAK are 23 federations which are in general formed on an industrial basis.
They are fairly independent in their collective bargaining activity which covers manufacturing, private services, transport, local government, and the state sector.
The federations in turn are composed of local unions which may comprise employees of one single large employer, or employees of all workplaces of the industry in the locality.
As from 1968, most collective agreements have included clauses on collection of union dues by check-off.
Upon an authorization, given in writing by the worker, the employer shall deduce union dues from wages and salaries and remit the amounts thus deducted to the trade union in question.
The system is generally applied and plays an important part in the stability of the trade unions’ economy.
Collective bargaining is regulated in the Collective Agreements Act, 1946.
As a precondition for the application of the Act, three basic characteristics of a collective agreement, relating to its parties, contents and form, are required to be at hand.
Under Sec.
1 of the Act, a collective agreement shall on the employer side be concluded by an employers’ association or by an employer, whereas on the employee side a trade union must appear as a party.
The agreement may also have more than two signatory parties, e.g.
one employee federation and two federations from the employer side.
Regarding contents, the agreement must set conditions to be observed in employment contracts or otherwise in employment relations.
This widely interpreted definition refers to the so called normative clauses of a collective agreement which regulate the terms and conditions of individual employment relationships (pay, working hours etc.).
A collective agreement may, in addition, contain obligatory clauses which are intended only to have legal effect between the contracting parties, e.g.
a commitment to develop new pay systems.
Finally, to be legally valid a collective agreement must under Sec.
2 of the Act be concluded in writing.
At the top level, the employees’confederations negotiate general and framework agreements with the central employers confederations regulating general wage increase, hours of work, the status of shop stewards, and other matters broadly pertaining to working life.
These agreements normally become binding after they have been incorporated in collective agreements concluded by the federations.
It is common practice that also the state takes part in such central negotiations which then may result in an incomes policy agreement covering social policy and tax solutions etc.
Most of the of collectively agreed terms of employment come into being at the level of nation-wide federations.
Usually there is one leading, comprehensive collective agreement in the industry in question.
However, where the organization of the trade union is based on craft, the union negotiates an agreement with the employers’federation in each industry.
Local agreements of various types have gained importance in recent years.
An industry-wide agreement may refer certain issues to be solved locally, or allow derogation from its contents by means of local agreements.
There are also independent company agreements concluded between an employer and a local or an industry-wide trade union.
Under Sec.
4 of the Collective Agreements Act, the subjects bound by the agreement are: 1) the parties to the agreement themselves and those who have in writing joined the agreement, and, 2) the associations as well as individual employers and employees which are, directly or through intermediary associations, members of associations which are parties to the agreement.
Employment terms included in the normative clauses of a collective agreement become automatically and with obligatory effect applicable within employment relationships covered by the agreement.
Moreover, an employer who is bound by the agreement shall observe its terms vis-à-vis his employees who are not themselves bound by the agreement (usually non-organized employees) but who perform work covered by the agreement.
The employment terms stipulated in a collective agreement may, however, usually be exceeded by means of individual employment contracts.
A compensatory fine is provided for in the Act to give effect to compliance with obligations ensuing from the agreement.
Associations bound by a collective agreement are under a duty to supervise that their members do not violate any provisions of the agreement.
Finally, a labour peace obligation enters into force for the agreement period as a statutory effect of the conclusion of a collective agreement.
The scope of certain collective agreements may be extended so that they have an obligatory effect also on employers not otherwise bound by the agreement.
Under Sec.
7 of Chapter 2 of the Employment Contracts Act, the general applicability of collective agreements presupposes that the agreement is nation-wide and can be deemed as representative in the field in question.
In the consideration of the said criteria several factors are taken into account, the point of departure being that about one-half of the employees in the field concerned are covered by the agreement already by virtue of the Collective Agreements Act.
The procedure for declaring a collective agreement to be generally applicable is regulated in a specific Act (2001), passed in connection with the new Employment Contracts Act.
A generally applicable collective agreement will not involve a labour peace obligation, nor any other obligations to the employee side.
The most important workers’ representative in the enterprise is the shop steward.
Chief stewards and department shop stewards are elected at the workplace by members of the local trade union.
The system is based on collective agreements, and the shop steward is considered to represent the local union especially in negotiations concerning the application of the collective agreement.
However, the shop steward has certain statutory tasks and rights as well.
The Employment Contracts Act has further accorded workers not represented by a shop steward a right to elect a workers’ delegate.
Under the occupational health and safety legislation, all workers of the undertaking have, regardless of union membership, a right to take part in the election of a labour safety representative for an office of two years at a time.
All workers’ representatives, mentioned above, enjoy special job security as well as statutory protection against discrimination.
They also have rights pertaining to information in their respective fields, and a right to compensation for loss of earnings.
Shop stewards have the most extensive rights, determined in detail in collective agreements.
The organization ofworker participation is under the Co-operation Within Undertakings Act (1978) arranged on the basis of the workers’ representation just explained.
Matters subject to the co-operation procedure may be discussed with the individual workers affected, but, if the matter concerns the personnel more generally, it is negotiated with the representatives, normally the shop stewards, of the personnel groups in question.
Sec. 6 of the Act contains an extensive list of issues to be handled in the procedure prior to the employer’s decision-making.
The most important of these issues relate to business reorganizations leading to collective dismissals or a transfer of the undertaking or a part thereof.
In these respects the Act has been adjusted to meet the requirements, regarding scope and content of the information and consultation duties, envisaged in the relevant EC Directives.
Industrial action is permissible within the limits laid down in the Collective Agreements Act and procedure regulated in the Act on Mediation in Labour Disputes (1962).
Under Sec.
8 of the Collective Agreements Act, the peace obligation is connected with the conclusion of a collective agreement and remains in force together with the agreement.
During this period all those bound by the agreement, except individual employees, are under a duty to refrain from taking industrial actions - meaning strike, lock-out, overtime ban, blockade, mass dismissal etc.
- directed against the agreement as a whole or any of its individual stipulations.
In addition to this so called passive peace obligation, parties bound by the agreement are under an active duty to ensure that their members respect industrial peace.
In case of a comprehensive collective agreement, there remains little margin for exerting lawful pressure against the opposite party in labour relations.
Political actions and genuine sympathetic actions are, however, permissible even during the agreement period.
An employer or an association may, under Sec.
8 of the Collective Agreements Act, be ordered by the Labour Court to pay a compensatory fine for a breach of the peace obligation.
According to the Employment Contracts Act, individual employees participating in an industrial action, legal or not legal, are protected against dismissal on condition that the action is decided by a trade union (7:2).
Thus, the legal consequences of organized industrial action are confined to the sphere of collective labour law rules only.
The procedural rules of the Act on Mediation in Labour Disputes become applicable when the peace obligation is not in force.
Under Sec.
7, any one intending to commence a strike or lock-out has to give notice to the opposite party and to the office of the National Conciliation Officers at least 14 days beforehand.
The Ministry of Labour may defer the intended labour stoppage for another 14 days, if essential general interest are threatened and extra time for mediation is deemed necessary.
Upon receiving the prior notice mentioned above the competent conciliator shall take measures to settle the dispute.
Such measures may include presenting a draft settlement to the parties, if negotiations convened by the conciliator have not lead to a solution.
No compulsory measures are, however, available to stop the projected labour stoppage or to enforce a settlement the parties are not willing to accept.
Individual labour disputes over rights, referring to labour legislation or to employment contracts, are heard and tried by the regular courts following the same procedure as applies e.g.
to other contractual disputes.
Accordingly, the Supreme Court is the last instance in these cases.
The Labour Court is a single special court established to deal with disputes connected with collective agreements.
The jurisdiction of the Court is reflected in its tripartite composition, consisting of neutral members and members representing employers and employees, all nominated for a three-year period.
The competence of the Court covers disputes concerning interpretation of collective agreements, and breaches against duties ensuing from collective agreements (such as violations of individual agreement clauses or the peace obligation).
The parties to lawsuits at the Labour Court are normally the parties to the collective agreement in question.
In recent years, approximately 100 suits per year have been brought before the Labour Court.
Legal proceedings at the Labour Court may only be instituted if the dispute has not been settled in a grievance procedure, if provided for in the collective agreement.
The procedure usually implies that disputes concerning the application of the agreement shall be handled in negotiations which are started at the level of the workplace and, if necessary, continued at the federation level.
Remaining disputes can then be taken to the Labour Court which gives a final decision in the case.

2009 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Palestine
Israeli labour law governs Palestinians working in Jerusalem.
They are free to form their own unions.
They may also belong simultaneously to unions affiliated with West Bank federations and to the Israeli Histadrut Labour Federation.
Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip who work in Israel have the right to organise their own unions in Israel or to join Israeli trade unions.
The right to strike: This right is recognised, but unions must give two week's advance notice, or four weeks in public utilities.
However, the Ministry of Labour can impose arbitration, and trade unions can face disciplinary action if they do not accept the outcome of that arbitration.
New trade union law in preparation: A new trade union law is being drafted and includes the institutional framework for industrial relations.
While the organisation of unions is still being discussed within the law's framework, the Palestinian General Federation of Trade Unions (PGFTU) has rejected the draft because it believes many sections violate ILO conventions 87 and 98.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2008
Trade union building targeted in Gaza: On 28 February, the PGFTU headquarters were destroyed by two Israeli rockets.
According to Nabil al-Mabhouh, acting PGFTU head, the building was targeted because the PGFTU is supporting the rights of tens of thousands of Palestinian workers.

Trade union rights in practice and Violations in 2007
Background: The lack of a legal and institutional framework for industrial relations means that social dialogue and tripartite activities are sporadic.
In addition, the dramatic rise in violence makes it almost impossible to carry out any effective trade union activity.
Palestinians' movements within and between the occupied territories are restricted by an ever tighter and more complex set of barriers, rules and permits.
Any normal daily exercise of freedom of association involving contacts and communication between trade unions and their branches, and between the various local bodies, has been rendered impossible by these restrictions on movement.
Attempts to assassinate PGFTU leaders: In the early hours of 29 January the home in Gaza of Rasem al Bayari, deputy general secretary of the Palestinian General Federation of Trade Unions, was partially destroyed by rockets.
It was then bombed 24 hours later.
On 10 July, Shaher Sae'd, general secretary of the PGFTU, was taken at gunpoint from a Nablus restaurant by masked men who threatened him in order to force him to resign his trade union position.
He refused.
He was released 30 minutes later.
Worker fired for signing letter demanding minimum wages: In November a worker who signed a letter to the management of the West Bank factory Sol-Or asking for minimum wages was sacked.
Ninety Palestinian workers at the Sol-Or factory, which manufactures and markets gas and petrol containers, went on strike, citing dangerous working conditions and low wages.
The workers had formed an impromptu union and were asking for a wage rise.
2009 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Israel
Although workers are free to join and establish trade unions and to organise and bargain collectively, most employers breach the labour law.
Palestinian workers in Israel, even with permits, are hounded by the authorities.
The university threatened to lock out striking lecturers, and workers at the Davidson Institute were beaten during a protest.
Israeli workers are free to join and establish trade unions and have the right to organise and bargain collectively.
New labour law: At the beginning of 2008, the government introduced a bill that would monitor the implementation of labour laws based on cooperation between the government, Histadrut and private employers' organisations.
The bill proposed a series of warnings and fines for non-compliance with labour laws, and places responsibility for maintaining the rights of workers, like cleaners and guards, on the body commissioning their services.
In October 2007, the Histadrut petitioned the Israeli High Court that laws should apply equally to Palestinian workers in the occupied territories.
It ruled that Palestinians working for Israeli employers in West Bank settlements should be given work benefits according to Israeli, rather than Jordanian, law.
However, it had not passed into law by the year's end.
Discrimination against Palestinian workers: Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip who work in Israel have the right to organise their own unions in Israel or to join Israeli trade unions.
However, the Palestinian members of Histadrut may not elect, or be elected to, its leadership bodies.
The Israeli government issued an additional 5,000 permits for Palestinian workers, of which 2,000 are for the construction sector, but at the same time it brought in a special tax for Israeli construction firms who employ Palestinians.
The declared purpose is to guarantee that the cost of employing Palestinian workers does not fall short of the cost of employing migrant workers.
It is likely that these taxes will be taken out of the Palestinian workers' wages.
Palestinian workers are entitled to protection under Israeli collective bargaining agreements negotiated by the General Federation of Labour in Israel, Histadrut, in exchange for paying 0.80% of their wages to Histadrut (half of which the federation remits to the bank account of the Palestinian General Federation of Trade Unions (PGFTU)).
In June 2008, Histradrut and the PGFTU signed an agreement, building on the original agreement, in which Histadrut agreed to reimburse the PGFTU the outstanding balance of union and legal representation fees paid since 1993 by Palestinians working for Israeli employers and to implement the early agreement to transfer 50% of union dues to the PGFTU.
In addition, the Histadrut committed itself to assisting Palestinian workers who had worked for Israel employers, to provide them with legal help and to improve their working conditions.
All non-resident workers are allowed to establish employees' organisations that will be recognised by the Israeli regional and national labour courts under the terms of the Collective Agreement Law.
Only recognised representative employees' organisations are entitled to engage in collective bargaining.
Restriction on right to strike: Strikes are permitted, but unions must give 15 days' advance notice unless otherwise specified in the collective bargaining agreement.
Strike leaders are protected by law.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2008
Most workers can exercise their union rights freely, though the labour courts often issue back-to-work orders in various sectors, as with a strike by port workers in September, and one by airport authority employees in November.
Changing forms of employment are also undermining the strength and position of the trade union movement.
Very poor respect of labour law: According to a 2006 report by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, 92% of employers breach the labour law.
The main victims are migrant workers and women.
In February 2008, the government approved a significant increase in the number of labour supervisors (from 19 to 77).
This decision followed the recommendations of the Steering Committee composed of representatives from the Histadrut, the Coordinating Bureau of Economic Organizations, and the Ministries of Industry, Commerce and Employment, and Finance.
Problems for Palestinian workers: The ILO reports that there are 60,000 Palestinians working legally and illegally in Israel; these workers face serious daily problems with crossing borders between the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
In addition to the travelling time involved, they are sometimes harassed and humiliated by border guards.
In September, border guards arrested 200 Palestinian labourers who had work permits and in another incident beat up 20 workers with work permits.
There were also reports that Israeli forces raided workplaces, tore up work permits, arrested Palestinians and put them through the court system.
Migrant workers: Migrant workers, who make up around 7% of the working population, are increasingly coming from Asia.
Many migrant workers are mistreated and threatened with deportation to deny them their basic rights.
Foreign trade union organisers are systematically expelled from the country.
the principle and the length of the qualifying period for implementing the principle of equal treatment between permanent and temporary workers.
Employers believe that this period should be 12 months or more; trade unions consider this vesting period too long.
Many temporary work agencies, however, have seen the need to atract better-qualified personnel in order to compete with the regular labour market and get rid of the sector's bad image.
In February 2007, Eurociett, an industry federation bringing together the largest temporary work agencies in Europe, and UNI-Europa, the European branch of the global services trade union, published a sectoral joint declaration on agency work and flexicurity which recognised "the importance of reaching a fair balance between the protection of agency workers and enhancing the positive role that agency work may play in the European labour market".
In a number of member states, collective agreements heve been concluded between employers' associations in the sector and trade unions.
This time, ministers may find an agreement.
The UK recently signalled its willingness to change its mind if that meant getting rid of collective agreements at national level, liberalising the sector across Europe and opening up new opportunities for temping agencies.
"From the UK's point of view, if we reach agreement on an equal treatment for an agency workers' directive, we would want it to properly apply to agency workers across Europe... Sometimes agency workers, because of collective agreements, may be paid less than other workers, or it may be to do with qualifying periods.
It may sometimes be a regime of not equal treatment, which is indefinite.
"
Services trade union UNI-Europa Secretary-General Bernadette Ségol, said: "UNI-Europa has recently signed a statement with Euro-Ciett , which is clear about our stand on equal treatment: temporary agency workers must be treated equally with workers in the user companies.
This should be the basic principle governing all EU countries.
Any other treatment is a source of injustice, exploitation and national and european downwards pressure on wages.
"
She added: "May I also point out that the social partners, when they considered an EU level agreement a few years ago, had opened the possibility for negotiations at national or sectoral level, to adapt the rule, if and when necessary.
UNI-Europa believes that there is an urgent need for a legislation at EU level, given the development of the sector and the need to establish clear operating rules.
"
ETUC, the European Trade Union Confederation, has expressed frustration towards Denmark, Germany, Ireland and the UK for blocking a deal, singling out their attitude for "special criticism".
"Trade unions throughout the EU have been lobbying hard to get this law approved... However, there has as yet been little sign of progress," ETUC said in a statement.
The real problem lies with the whole idea of retirement as something that falls across our path like a tree in a storm.
And that is because we have such fixed ideas about a "normal" working life.
Why should everyone be expected work at least eight hours a day, five days a week – and often much more?
Why do we look upon the rise in "part-time" employment as some kind of aberration, instead of a step in the right direction?
The New Economics Foundation is calling for a move towards a much shorter working week, over a decade or more, with a goal of 21 hours as the new standard.
We start from the premise that a return to unfettered growth is not only unlikely, given the state of global capitalism, but also undesirable for developed economies because it is incompatible with reducing carbon on the scale required to keep global warming within manageable limits.
That means finding ways to manage the economy so that it can flourish but not grow – remaining in a state of "dynamic equilibrium".
In these circumstances, we can't expect an ever-expanding volume of paid employment.
But as leading economists Tim Jackson and Peter Victor point out, instead of settling for high rates of unemployment, why not share the work out, with shorter hours for all allowing more people to join the labour force?
No one imagines this will be easy, but an incremental shift would leave time to put compensating measures in place – a higher minimum wage, more training, flexible working conditions and a gradual trade-off between pay increments and working time.
These are explored in our recent report, 21 Hours , but there is still a lot of work to be done on the details of the transition.
The benefits of a shorter working week could be very substantial.
Think of it as a redistribution of paid and unpaid time.
People who are currently out of work get a chance to earn a living.
Everyone gets more discretionary time – so they have more freedom to play their part as parents, carers, friends, neighbours and active citizens.
It begins to make sense of the notion of "work-life balance", which has proved so elusive – especially for parents and carers – in a long-hours culture.
It could even help to realise some of the more honourable intentions of the "big society" – how else, after all, are citizens and voluntary organisations to find the time to take more control over what happens to them at a local level?
The New Economics Foundation is calling for a move towards a much shorter working week, over a decade or more, with a goal of 21 hours as the new standard
Why do we look upon the rise in "part-time" employment as some kind of aberration, instead of a step in the right direction?
I'm not sure who "we" are here, there have been plenty of government campaigns promoting part-time work and plenty of employers are happy to offer part time work.
The people who might see a shorter working week as an aberration would be those who would suffer a loss of income as a result.
Because there isn't a fixed amount of work that needs to be "shared out"?
A shorter working week may be desirable for many reasons, but it won't cure unemployment (any more than allowing people to work longer will exacerbate it)..
Oh, and overtime even for salaried workers (this has been a bugbear of mine for years- doing a 70 hour week and getting paid for 37.5 hours is the most depressing thing I think I'll ever do in my working life).

How about this for a concept....why not let people chose how long they work in contract with their employers / customers and stop interfering and lecturing others on how to live and work their lives?
Under the Employment Standards Act, 2000 ( ESA ) a person's employment is terminated if the employer:
An employer is not required to give an employee a reason why his or her employment is being terminated.
There are, however, some situations where an employer cannot terminate an employee's employment even if the employer is prepared to give proper written notice or termination pay.
For example, an employer cannot end someone's employment, or penalize them in any way, if any part of the reason for the termination of employment is based on the employee asking questions about the ESA or exercising a right under the ESA , such as refusing to work in excess of the daily or weekly hours of work maximums, or taking a leave of absence specified in the ESA .
Please see the chapter on Reprisals .
The termination-of-employment rules are entirely separate from any entitlements an employee may have to be paid severance pay under the ESA .
The employee would have to resign in response to the significant change within a reasonable period of time in order for the employer's actions to be considered a termination of employment for purposes of the ESA .
A week of layoff does not include any week in which the employee did not work for one or more days because the employee was not able or available to work, was subject to disciplinary suspension, or was not provided with work because of a strike or lockout.
Employers are not required under the ESA to provide employees with a written notice of a temporary layoff, nor do they have to produce a reason.
They may, however, be required to do these things under a collective agreement or an employment contract.
the employer recalls the employee within the time frame set out in an agreement with an employee who is not represented by a trade union;
a layoff longer than a layoff described in 'B' where the employer recalls an employee who is represented by a trade union within the time set out in an agreement between the union and the employer.
an employer can terminate the employment of an employee who has been employed continuously for three months or more if the employer has given the employee proper written notice of termination and the notice period has expired;
an employer can terminate the employment of an employee without written notice or with less notice than is required if the employer pays termination pay to the employee.
Notice of termination of employment, once given, cannot be withdrawn without the consent of the employee.
Note: Special rules determine the amount of notice required in the case of mass terminations - where 50 or more employees are terminated at an employer's establishment within a four-week period.
This is an employee's rate of pay for each non-overtime hour of work in the employee's work week.
These are wages other than overtime pay, vacation pay, public holiday pay, premium pay, termination pay and severance pay and certain contractual entitlements.
For an employee who usually works the same number of hours every week, a regular work week is a week of that many hours, not including overtime hours.
An employer is not allowed to reduce an employee's entitlement to wages by scheduling an employee's vacation time during the statutory notice period unless the employee--after receiving written notice of termination of employment--agrees to take his or her vacation time during the notice period.
There are special rules for providing notice of termination if an employee has a contract of employment or a collective agreement that provides seniority rights, allowing an employee who is laid off or terminated to displace ("bump") other employees.
In that case, the employer must post a notice in the workplace (where it will be seen by the employees) setting out the names, seniority and job classification of those employees the employer intends to terminate and the date of the proposed termination.
The posting of the notice is considered to be notice of termination, as of the date of the posting, to an employee who is named in the notice.
However, this notice of termination must still meet the length requirements set out in the ESA .
Special rules for notice of termination may apply when the employment of 50 or more employees is terminated at an employer's establishment within a four-week period.
This is often referred to as mass termination.
(Note: an "establishment" can, in some circumstances, include more than one location.
)
When a mass termination occurs, the employer must submit the Form 1 (Notice of Termination of Employment) to the Director of Employment Standards before giving notice to the affected employees.
Notice of mass termination is not considered to be effective until the employer submits this form.
In addition to providing employees with individual notices of termination, the employer must post a copy of the Form 1 provided to the Director of Employment Standards in the workplace where it will come to the attention of the employees it affects on the first day of the notice period.
The amount of notice employees must receive in a mass termination is not based on the employees' length of employment, but on the number of employees who have been terminated.
An employer must give:
A "recall right" is the right of an employee on a layoff to be called back to work by his or her employer under a term or condition of employment.
This right is commonly found in a collective agreement.
If an employee is entitled to both termination pay and severance pay, he or she must make the same choice for both.
If an employee who is not represented by a trade union elects to keep his or her recall rights or fails to make a choice, the employer must send the amount of the termination pay (and severance pay, if any) to the Director of Employment Standards, who holds the money in trust.
If an employee who is represented by a trade union elects to keep his or her recall rights or fails to make a choice, the employer and the trade union must try to come to an arrangement to hold the termination pay (and severance pay, if any) in trust for the employee.
If they cannot come to an arrangement, the employer must send the termination pay (and severance pay, if any) to the Director of Employment Standards, who holds the money in trust.
has refused to exercise his or her right to another position that is available under a seniority system.
This usually means the employee gives up the right to displace or "bump" another employee in order to keep working;
is terminated during or as a result of a strike or lockout at the workplace;

Section 6 Senior Staff Scheme 2006, three‑day working week
Parties to and nature of the collective agreement (CAO)
ABVAKABO FNV : Trade union affiliated with the Federation of Dutch Trade Unions (FNV);
The parties hereby declare that they have entered into a collective agreement on employment conditions, the text and the appendices of which read as given below:
The collective agreement (CAO) of Dutch Universities is intended to implement the provisions in Article 4.5 of the Higher Education and Academic Research Act (WHW), insofar as agreed at the branch of industry level and it lays down the regulations on employment conditions for all Dutch universities, and applies to special universities as a collective labour agreement within the meaning of the Collective Labour Agreement Act.
This collective agreement is a standard collective agreement explicitly indicating when and to which extent additional interpretations may be given at institutional level.
Employees working as postdocs on the basis of 0.5 FTE or more will in 2008 and 2009 be entitled to a non‑recurring, personal budget of 1000 euros a year.
The total budget of 2000 euros can also be granted in one go.
By making additional financial resources available, parties make it possible for postdocs to enhance their employability in the internal and external labour market in a sustainable way and thereby generate an impulse for career formation and personal development.
Since the position of postdoc is not defined in UFO as such, the basic assumption in this regard is that a postdoc is a member of staff with a PhD in temporary employment working, in terms of job profile, as a researcher at level 3 or 4.
Agreements will be made between the postdoc and the employer during the yearly interview with regard to the allocation of the budget.
By definition, academic members of staff benefit from working in a results‑oriented way.
Regulations concerning working hours and accounting for leave are therefore less meaningful to them.
For this reason, parties to the collective agreement have agreed to experiment during this agreement period with function based contracts concluded between the employer and the employee by mutual agreement.
This voluntary condition also applies to academic staff who enter employment in future.
When a function based contract is concluded, leave days shall be deemed to have been taken up at the end of the calendar year.
Collective agreement Articles based on time and relating to terms of employment, including that of the individual choices model, will not apply.
A function based contract must, however, include agreements about sabbatical leave.
The experiment will continue until the end of the collective agreement’s term and will be evaluated before the end of that term.
The parties to the collective agreement shall take work pressure, the capacity of senior staff to deal with those pressures, part‑time working into account during this evaluation.
To an increasing degree, the careers of young academic staff at Dutch Universities are based on tenure track policy.
Because this policy must primarily be formulated at the level of the institution itself, with due consideration being given to the specific circumstances and the profile of the institution or faculty concerned, the parties to the collective agreement agreed to include an outline framework for tenure track in the collective agreement.
The parties shall agree on a representative study into a staffing policy oriented towards stage of life based on the principle that employees must be able to remain effectively and healthily at work in each stage of life.
The aim of the study is to develop a new staffing policy oriented towards stage of life before the end of the collective agreement’s term that will replace the current age‑based schemes such as the 60+ scheme, the age days and the general senior staff scheme.
This must be supported by custom work.
In developing the new policy, the financial capacity required by the current policy is in any case available and a link will be sought with the ABP pension scheme and the current collective agreement framework for career policy.
Use will also be made of (inter)national research into the best options and instruments for employers and employees to promote career development and mobility (‘active aging’).
Instruments developed by employers’ organisations may also be used in this regard.
The study will be completed before 1 June 2009.
For the category of employees whose occupational disability is less than 35%, the agreement concluded at the introduction of the Work and Income (Ability to Work) Act (WIA) was that the contracts of employment of these employees would remain in force.
The parties to the collective agreement agree that, following the period of continued wage payment, employees who are less than 35% occupationally disabled according to the WIA decision will be paid 100% of hours worked in the position which they occupy at that time.
80% of the original remuneration will be paid for the hours not worked, to a minimum of 90% of the original remuneration in total.
Employer: the Board of Governors and, with regard to the special universities, the Executive Committee of the Association/Foundation; the Free University, the Free University Medical Centre and the Windesheim Academy are part of the Free University Windesheim Association legal entity.
The Radboud University in Nijmegen and the UMC St Radboud form part of the Catholic University Foundation legal entity.
With regard to the applicability of this collective agreement (CAO) on an institutional level, the Free University and the RUN are the employer;
Temporary employment contract: temporary employment contract, arranged either for a predetermined period or for an objectively definable set of circumstances, the duration of which is not precisely known in advance;
Salary: the monthly amount established for the employee in question based on the salary tables in Section 5 of Appendix A to this collective agreement (CAO);
Hourly salary: 1/165th part of the monthly salary in case of full‑time employment (excluding holiday allowance and end-of-year bonus);
Salary grade: a series of numbered salaries, included as such in Appendix A of this collective agreement (CAO);
ee.
CAO: the collective agreement of the Dutch Universities;
The authority of the employer under the terms of the collective agreement (CAO) is exercised by the Board of Governors insofar this authority is not reserved for the Directors of the Association or the Directors of the Foundation under the terms of the relevant Charter or Two-Tier Entity Scheme.
In most EU member states, social dialogue between trade unions and employers is an essential feature of the democratic process.
Trade unions and employers negotiate pay and working conditions, and, in some countries, they also have a say in social security arrangements or have key roles in other areas.
They help government manage the economy, or seek through dialogue to secure proper economic governance.
Trade unions and employers were involved in the European venture from the start.
For instance, representatives of national organisations sat on the European Economic and Social Committee and the Commission too conducted formal and informal consultation exercises.
However, genuine bipartite social dialogue did not become truly established until 1985.
In that year, twenty-five years ago now, the then president of the European Commission, Jacques Delors, convened a meeting at Val Duchesse/Hertoginnedal in Brussels.
This proved to be the launch pad for bipartite social dialogue between the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) under the leadership of Georges Debunne, and European employers and the Union of Industrial and Employers’ Confederations of Europe (UNICE – now known as BUSINESSEUROPE).
The ETUC was set up in 1973 and now represents 82 national trade unions and 12 European sectoral organisations.
BUSINESSEUROPE – established as UNICE in 1958 – brings together 39 employers’ organisations from 33 countries, and 20 major companies are also represented within its ranks.
On the employers’ side, BUSINESSEUROPE has now been joined by the UEAPME, representing small and medium-sized enterprises, while the CEEP, representing public-sector companies, was already part of the Val Duchesse/Hertoginnedal negotiations in 1985.
Since 1985, no fewer than 36 industrial sectors have been brought on board; some 40 intersectoral ‘common positions’ have also been negotiated, alongside a further 500 sectoral positions.
Social dialogue has come a long way (albeit we could explore further the content and scope of the common positions) and the social partners are much more involved in democratic decision-making and the economic process.
Social dialogue and the right to collective bargaining were enshrined in the 1993 Maastricht Treaty.
The text itself was agreed between trade unions and employers and provides a legal framework for independently negotiated and implemented European collective agreements.
That said, the success was not immediate.
A European framework for European works councils in transnational companies was established at a political level thanks to the introduction of majority decision-making in the Council under the Maastricht Treaty, notwithstanding an agreement among the social partners.
By 2007, only six binding intersectoral framework agreements were in place, relating to parental leave, part-time work, fixed-term work, telework, work-related stress and harassment and violence at work.
A seventh intersectoral agreement was reached in 2009 on improved rights to parental leave.
No agreements proved possible in key areas such as working time or social dialogue in European companies, although willingness to negotiate varies very much from one sector to the next.
The posted workers directive, which is of key importance in the construction sector, is in essence based on an agreement between the social partners in the timber and construction sector.
Working-time agreements have also been negotiated in the transport sector.
The introduction of the euro and the need for more robust economic governance has heralded a third phase in the development of European social dialogue.
In 1999, a decision was taken at the Cologne European Council to establish a macro-economic dialogue between the social partners, the Commission and representatives of the member states, who would consult regularly with the European Central Bank on economic and monetary policy.
In 2002, the European Convention proposed that social dialogue be included in the constitution as one of the basic democratic principles of the European Union, but this suggestion was – in my view, inexplicably – jettisoned in the subsequent negotiations after the constitution was rejected in the Dutch and French referendums, the pretext being that social dialogue had already been part of the social provisions since 2003.
That could not halt the momentum.
From 2002 onwards, two work programmes (covering the periods 2003-2005 and 2006-2008) were put in place, while a third programme for 2009 and 2010 dealing primarily with mitigating the effects of the crisis is proving hard to implement in practice.
The historical process described above is underpinned by two key factors.
For one thing, there is a growing awareness that the international and European economy cannot flourish without the involvement of the social partners.
A social model cannot be established in an economic wasteland.
But also – and indeed in particular – in terms of industrial relations and trade union activity, establishing a proper balance of power is the fruit of industrial conflict and unrest.
The European works council directive might never have seen the light of day without the industrial unrest – and the resistance to it – that accompanied, for instance, the 1986 closure of the Michelin plant in Zuun, Belgium.
The fight against the closure of the Renault plant in Vilvoorde, Belgium, in 2006 should go down in history as the first transnational industrial conflict.
Without the European works council, that would never have been possible.
Opinions vary widely as to the success of European social dialogue.
From the trade union perspective, it is hard to talk of success at all.
Binding collective agreements have been thin on the ground.
Macro-economic dialogue with the European Central Bank is often more a succession of speeches than genuine consultation and discussion.
The ‘common positions’ adopted between the social partners are hardly beacons of clarity and practical action.
In the case of transnational companies, the outcomes have been more positive, although the issues involved – such as restructurings and closures – have meant coming out on the defensive.
Without European social dialogue (and support from all the trade unions involved), the Volkswagen plant in Forest/Vorst, Belgium, would have been closed for good, and Opel too would most likely have become a social wasteland.
The European works council has been a key driving force in giving the trade unions a more European dimension.
By working together across international borders, there is a growing awareness that we can do more together than apart and that the same problems one plant faces today might be the same ones others will have to face tomorrow.
It is a pity that the intersectoral level has not embarked on a similar path.
In the past, many trade unions have been too anti-European and have failed to organise at European level and thus make the ETUC a genuine European trade union.
Many have still not grasped the need for this – despite the crisis.
The same is also true, albeit now to a lesser extent, for the European political parties.
Strong social partners are the most solid basis for social dialogue.
But proper machinery for such dialogue also needs to be put in place.
First of all, we urgently need to address the issue of a European labour council, along similar lines to the national labour council in Belgium.
This should be established under the auspices of the European Economic and Social Committee and be a permanent meeting place for European social partners.
The European labour council – and its constituent members – must be recognised as privileged partners by the Commission, the Parliament and the Council.
Secondly, European tripartite dialogue must no longer be seen as something out of the ordinary.
The most significant decisions are not taken at ‘event’ meetings: ongoing dialogue on all matters of economic concern between the three parties involved – government, trade unions and employers – is much more important.
Thirdly, it is not only employers but also trade unions that must have an organised say in all policy areas and must be recognised a genuine partners.
The European Commission seeks to present itself as a model of transparency and democracy and has organised public consultations via its website.
Anyone is free to express an opinion.
But the social partners can hardly be treated in the same way as a private individual or interest group, however noteworthy their concerns may be.

(CBS)
(CBS) Labor Day 2010 finds a lot of American workers on the sidelines.
The U.S. unemployment rate stands at 9.6 percent.
There are five job seekers for every opening.
And in many cases those who have jobs are being asked to take pay cuts even at healthy companies.
CBS News correspondent Elaine Quijano reports on a case in point in Williamson N.Y.
"When there's a situation when you have wages and benefits out of line with the local market and industry norms, however difficult it may be, it's something we have an obligation to address," said Tina Barry, the company's senior vice president for corporate affairs.
America has loved the 100 to 500 % mark ups from cheap labour and there inflated funny money but now it's time to level the playing field so we go down and they go up .
It is a simple as that.
faster we learn the happier we can move forward.
There is many more job cuts to come in the future
The Commission is about to finalise its Communication on 'flexicurity', the Nordic reform model that, according to some, may solve Europe's unemployment problem.
At the same time, social partners are at odds with each other on the core lesson to be learned from Denmark, Finland and Sweden - EurActiv put the question to three experts from the EU's employer associations and trade unions.
Ronald Janssen is an advisor for labour market policy and European employment strategy for ETUC, the European Trade Union Confederation.
Marc Stocker is senior advisor for economic and financial affairs with BusinessEurope, the association of corporate employers.
In your opinion, does it make sense for social partners to try and define common ground using 'flexicurity'?
More precisely, is there sufficient common ground between partners?
Ronald Janssen: Labour market issues are social partners' core business and providing a balance between flexibility and security is an important aspect of labour market functioning.
So, it certainly makes sense to try and define common principles.
Is there sufficient common ground for social partners to do so?
Provided that employers do not take a narrow perspective by prioritising short-term profits over long-term solutions, there might indeed be a certain margin here.
After all, employers can hardly expect that workers, who do not feel secure because of precarious working conditions, will be productive, able to engage in further learning or eager to participate in workplace innovation.
However, at the same time, the ETUC observes that policymakers are often using flexicurity to focus only on more flexibility for firms without paying any attention to the security of workers, with the recent country recommendations proposed by the Commission for the 2007 Lisbon Spring Council being the latest example.
The real agenda hiding behind 'flexicurity' simply seems to be the dismantling of job protection, thereby giving employers even more power to press for lower wages and reduce workers' flexibility.
So, the central question is whether employer organisations, in the knowledge that they have support from some policymakers, will be willing to move into a real and meaningful dialogue on what should be the right balance between flexibility and security instead of simply pursuing narrow interests?
Marc Stocker: The ongoing discussions between European social partners in the context of our work programme 2006-2008 have broad and ambitious objectives: identifying the key challenges facing Europe's labour markets, deciding appropriate joint recommendations to the EU and national institutions and defining priorities to be included in a framework of actions on employment.
Within this mandate, we are trying to characterise what flexicurity means for European social partners.
This is not an exclusive objective but it is nevertheless crucial.
Flexicurity is an appealing concept because it offers a way to restore a positive link between competitiveness and social protection.
Globalisation and technological progress require responsiveness to deliver their full benefits, and hence finding new ways to combine social protection and economic flexibility is fundamental to more and higher-productivity jobs.
There is also a strong political momentum in the EU, which is reflected by the Council's decision to discuss flexicurity with a view to adopting a set of common principles for national reforms.
The Troika of the German, Portuguese and Slovenian EU presidencies has already issued a joint paper on the issue .
European social partners could make a very positive contribution in the debate if they are able to present a common understanding of the key components of flexicurity.
At the same time, it must be clear that, due to national differences, there will be no European solution and that the European social partners will not be able to solve all the problems that different member states have to face as regards labour markets and social reforms.
Therefore, the role of EU social partners must be a different one.
If we are able together to analyse the different problems with current regulations, assess reform processes and provide good practices and ideas for other countries, we could play an important role in facilitating national negotiations, increasing awareness and strengthening political support for reforms.
This is particularly true for issues such as indefinite versus fixed term or temporary contracts, incentives to enter or to stay in labour markets (the famous 'make work pay' concept), employability of low qualified people, precarious contracts and poverty gaps in some cases.
This is exactly the aim of the current work on a joint labour market analysis, which we will try to circulate before summer.
What it should not seek to do is harmonise, tying member states' hands with varying circumstances and needs.
For instance, the competence to modernise labour law lies first and foremost with member states and most measures need to be taken there.
Taking a top-down legislative approach at the EU level would be counter-productive.
recognition of social dialogue and the role that social partners should be playing.
This, for example, implies that European social partners, in particular the ETUC, are not bypassed, by only giving a voice to professional associations presenting the business point of view only, and;
Flexible labour law with smart rules on protection against dismissals and a variety of employment contracts to answer different needs of companies and workers together with a strong commitment to fight undeclared work.
This is also one of the central issues in the Commission's Green Paper on Labour Law, the launch of which has triggered a Europe-wide debate on the modernisation of labour markets.
The purpose of this debate should not be to protect the principles of the past but looking constructively on how to prepare our future;
having an employment-friendly social-protection system and in particular unemployment insurance that links rights and obligations for the unemployed.
the shift from 'job security' to 'employment security' concept, by trying to reduce barriers and eliminate fears of employer change;
strong joint commitment of social partners to improve workforce employability.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Vietnam
The official trade union confederation has been criticised on all sides for its ineffectiveness.
The government continues to victimise independent trade unions.
There are many obstacles to the free enjoyment of trade union rights.
Workers may not organise or join unions of their choosing, as all unions must be approved by and affiliate with the Vietnam General Confederation of Labour (VGCL) and operate under its umbrella.
The VGCL, on its part, is under the leadership of the ruling party.
Individual unions can only affiliate with, join or participate in international labour bodies if approved by the VGCL.
While VGCL-affiliated unions have the right to bargain collectively, the right to strike is severely restricted.
The voting thresholds for calling a strike are prohibitively high, and all strikes must relate to collective labour disputes or concern industrial relations.
Furthermore, strikes that involve more than one enterprise are illegal, as are strikes called in public services or state-owned enterprises.
Strikes are also banned in sectors considered important to the national economy and defence, a definition which currently covers a total of 54 sectors.
The Prime Minister can suspend a strike considered detrimental to the national economy or public security.
Finally, if a strike is ruled illegal, the union and the individuals involved are liable for compensation to the employer for "losses and damages".
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
No freedom of association: Workers do not have the right to form or join a trade union that is not affiliated to the Vietnam General Confederation of Labour (VGCL), the official labour confederation controlled by the Communist Party.
A new generation of trade unionists is emerging however, who do not have such close links to the party, notably in the post and telecommunications sector.
Official labour confederation criticised for its ineffectiveness: Strikes in Vietnam are usually called by informal groups of workers, even where there is a VGCL (Vietnam General Confederation of Labour) union delegation.
The local authorities and representatives of the official union usually try to hold negotiations between workers and management.
However the VGCL mainly takes the interests of the government and the enterprise into account during negotiations.
In February, several representatives of the authorities called for a review of the labour legislation in order to clarify the roles and responsibilities of the trade unions.
The deputy-director of the Ho Chi Minh City Export Processing and Industrial Zone Authority (HEPZA) explained that workers go on wild cat strikes because the procedures for organising a legitimate strike were too complicated and because workers considered that strikes were the only way to claim their rights and that most of the local trade unions did not fulfil their role of representing members and protecting their rights.
At least three independent activists still in detention: In May a Human Rights Watch report documented the government's repression of activists who tried to create independent trade unions.
The report recalls that since 2006 at least eight independent activists have been sentenced to prison on dubious national security charges.
Three of them were still in prison at the end of 2009: Doan Van Dien, one of the founders of the the United Worker-Farmers Organisation of Vietnam (UWFO), Tran Quoc Hien, UWFO spokesperson, and Le Thi Cong Nhan, a lawyer and multi-party democracy campaigner.
During her trial she was accused of "fallacious interpretation" of government policies on labour unions.
Her articles on the internet criticised national legislation that allowed for arbitrary detention, prevented the creation of independent trade unions and the exercise of the right to strike.
Le Thi Cong Nhan is being held in Yen Dinh prison, 150km south of Hanoi.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Zambia
The right to strike was again undermined as striking nurses faced police intimidation and the threat of dismissal.
On several occasions workers took strike action because of their frustration at the way employers, including the government, ignored or delayed collective bargaining.
The right to strike is severely limited in law.
A number of limitations on trade union rights apply despite initial guarantees.
While the Constitution provides for freedom of association, there can only be one union per industry.
Furthermore, workers in the prison service, judges, court registrars and magistrates are excluded from the Industrial and Labour Relations Act, and the Minister also has discretionary powers to exclude certain categories of workers from the scope of the Act.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Background: Zambia was hit hard by the global economic downturn as the price of copper slumped and thousands of jobs were lost in the mining industry.
Zambia remains one of the world's poorest countries, with 60% of the population living below the poverty line.
In August Frederick Chiluba, who was President of Zambia from 1991 to 2002 and a former General Secretary of the Zambia Congress of Trade Unions, was cleared of corruption charges after a six year trial.
Trade union rights flouted: Trade union rights are widely flouted particularly in the mining sector, which is dominated by foreign owners, notably Chinese investors who are often accused of intimidating behaviour.
The Zambia Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) has expressed concern at the government's failure to apply labour legislation, particularly when it comes to Chinese investors.
The increasing number of sub-contractors in the mining industry makes it harder to organise the workers, and when trade unions do succeed they are often faced with employers who try to avoid social dialogue.
Because the right to strike is subject to a long series of procedural requirements, in practice it is almost impossible for workers to hold a legal strike.
Employers take advantage of this to declare strikes illegal and dismiss labour activists.
The health workers' strike was called off further to a meeting between the Health Minister, the Zambia Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU), the Zambia Nurses Union Organisation (ZUNO) and members of the clergy.
As a result of that meeting, the government agreed that nurses' allowances were too small and promised to set up a technical committee to look at how to meet the nurses' demands.
Striking miners dismissed: On 13 November, police officers were sent to disperse hundreds of mine workers at the Konkola Copper Mine, on the fourth day of their strike.
There had previously been some violent incidents, although the union pointed out that is was largely due to the massive frustration felt by the miners at the failure to address their demands.
The National Union of Miners and Allied Workers (NUMAW) said that the company had given the workers an ultimatum to return to work or lose their jobs, declaring the strike illegal.
It refused to resume talks until the miners returned to work.
The strike was called off and talks on demands for better working conditions and pay resumed.
In early December however, Konkola Copper Mines dismissed at least 40 employees for their role in the strike.
University frustrates collective bargaining: At the end of December the University of Zambia Lecturers and Researchers' Union (UNZALARU), the University of Zambia and Allied Workers Union (UNZAAWU) and the University of Zambia Professional and Senior Staff Association (UNZAPROSSA) warned that the current situation at the institution was potentially explosive .
In June, all members of staff at the university had gone on strike after the university management failed to meet outstanding contractual obligations and facilitate meaningful collective bargaining.
The strike was called off after assurances that a solution to the unions' concerns was being sought.
By December however nothing had changed.
Furthermore the Minister of Education had ignored numerous requests by the unions for a meeting with her.
At the end of the year two of the organisations at the university were still negotiating for improved conditions of service for 2009.
The unions stated that the management with the full backing of the university council had done everything possible to delay and frustrate the collective bargaining process.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Yemen
Several strikers and unionists were dismissed and detained while many workers remain unorganised and subject to abuse.
The authorities have increasingly stepped up repression of independent media and journalists.
There is only one official trade union organisation, and the law is not conducive to trade union activities.
Many excessive restrictions apply despite some trade union rights being recognised.
While freedom of association is guaranteed in the Constitution, all unions must belong to the General Federation of Worker's Trade Unions of Yemen (GFWTUY), the country's only umbrella union organisation.
A proposed Labour Code would allow foreign workers to join trade unions, although they would still not have the right to be elected to trade union office.
Furthermore, the right to strike is very limited.
Permission to strike must be obtained from the GFWTUY, and all strikes must concern more than two thirds of the workforce of the employer.
Three weeks' notice must always be given, and strikes may not be carried out for "political purposes".
Also, industrial disputes may be referred to compulsory arbitration at the request of only one of the parties, in which case a strike can be suspended for 85 days, and all strikes are banned in some sectors such as ports, airlines and hospitals.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Background: Since the middle of 2009 clashes between government forces and rebels in the north-west of Yemen have killed hundreds and displaced many more leading to a humanitarian crisis.
Additionally there are fears of a growth in the influence of Al-Qaeda.
The government promised to improve the labour law to give more union freedom, but without results.
The International Federation of Journalists urged the Yemeni authorities to guarantee the safety of journalists in the country following death threats made against Murad Hashem, Al-Jazeera's bureau chief in Yemen.
Employer resistance to organising and bargaining: Many private sector employers do not allow their workers to organise.
In both the public and private sector, many trade unions are not allowed to negotiate collective agreements.
Strikes do occur however.
For example, following negotiations with the Yemeni Journalists Syndicate, an affiliate of the International Journalists Federation (IFJ), in early 2009, the government agreed to a pay rise and improved contracts for 2010.
The agreement came after a partial strike of journalists working in four media groups who had observed a work stoppage of one hour per day for one week.
Strike organisers arrested: Problems between the management and workers at the new "Port II / Caltex port" in Aden (a newly privatized section of the state-owned port) remain unresolved.
The non-recognition and banning of trade unions, delays in salaries, non implementation of the agreement concerning workers rights signed between the Port management and the Ministry of Transport, led to a massive strike in the port and the arrest of six of the organisers in November 2008.
Intervention by The International Transport Federation (ITF) helped end the conflict and the detained workers were released.
However, trade unions are still not allowed and working conditions remained poor.
Union members dismissed and drivers' union's registration revoked: In April 2009, the General Federation of Workers' Trade Unions of Yemen (GFWTUY) wrote to the Minister of Social Affairs and Labour to protest against the cancellation of the official registration of the Total Drivers' Syndicate.
It also asked for four drivers dismissed in connection with an industrial dispute, including the head of the union Abdullah Al-Mihdhar, to be reinstated.
The letter stated that cancelling the registration of the Total Drivers' Syndicate violated the provisions of Trade Union Law No.
35, issued in 2002, particularly articles 2 and 14.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Zimbabwe
There were fewer serious trade union rights violations than in previous years, thanks in part to the new Government of National Unity, but many problems persist.
Members of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) still faced harassment at the hands of the police, ZANU-PF youths and the Central Intelligence Organisation.
Three striking mineworkers were shot and injured and many workers faced severe sanctions for exercising the right to strike.
ZCTU President Lovemore Matombo was arrested in November along with four colleagues under the notorious Public Order and Security Act.
Union activities are hampered by restrictive legal provisions, and there are no trade union rights in the public sector.
The labour laws pertaining to trade union rights are lacking.
Although private sector workers enjoy freedom of association, public sector workers do not have the right to form and join trade unions, to bargain collectively, or to strike.
The Registrar has the power to supervise trade union elections, and can cancel, postpone, or change the venue of the elections.
Furthermore, collective bargaining is not the exclusive prerogative of trade unions, as workers' committees may also bargain at the company level, hence potentially undermining the unions.
All collective bargaining agreements must then be approved by the authorities.
The right to strike is also limited, as the procedures that must be exhausted prior to a strike are excessively long.
Employers are not prohibited from hiring replacement workers during a strike, and also have the right to sue workers for liability during unlawful strikes.
The penalties for participating in an illegal strike include harsh prison sentences of up to five years.
Strikes are banned in "essential services", the list of which exceeds the ILO definition.
The Minister also has discretionary powers to decide what constitutes an essential service.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Background: The year started with high hopes of economic recovery and improvements in the political landscape.
The three main political parties entered into a Government of National Unity (GNU) that became functional in February.
Morgan Tsvangirai, the president of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) and former trade union leader, became Prime Minister.
There was strong economic growth but salaries remained stagnant, and the government faced widespread industrial unrest.
Harassment and intimidation by ZANU-PF: In practice, trade union members still face harassment and intimidation from the authorities and supporters of Robert Mugabe's ZANU-PF party.
The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) is seen as being close to the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) and has been a particular target for harassment as a result, although the MDC's participation in the government has helped the situation slightly.
Several incidents occurred during the year, however.
The ZCTU reported, for example, that its District Committee member in Karoi, Mr. Toindepi Tsigo, was assaulted by ZANU-PF thugs returning from a ZANU-PF meeting in Harare.
The youths attacked Mr. Tsigo and removed his ZCTU T-shirt, saying they did not wish to see a ZCTU person in Karoi.
Teachers also reported being were terrorised by ZANU-PF youths over the summer further to protest action.
Ignoring international labour standards: For many years, the Mugabe government repeatedly refused to cooperate with the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and for two years running refused to appear before the Committee on the Application of Standards at the International Labour Conference.
As a result, the ILO decided in November 2008 to apply one of its toughest measures, a Commission of Inquiry, to examine complaints concerning the non-observance by Zimbabwe of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No.
87) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No.
98). The Commission of Inquiry began its work in February 2009.
Union activities obstructed under multitude of laws: The 2002 Public Order and Security Act (POSA) bans any public gathering held without police permission.
Although public gatherings held by a registered trade union for bona fide trade union activities are exempted from the act, in practice it is still used to obstruct union activities and harass trade unionists.
Under the POSA, people found guilty of disturbing the peace, security or public order, or of invading the rights of other people, are liable to a fine and/or imprisonment for up to ten years.
On 25 February, employees were instructed to return to their workstations after have been assured that their concerns would be dealt with.
The workers returned to their workstations and were paid cash.
However, from 27 February, 37 employees were suspended and 11 later dismissed for allegedly engaging in an illegal collective job action.
The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) challenged the suspension and dismissal in the Labour court, which heard the matter and reserved judgment.
The substantive issues were heard by the Arbitrator, and the Arbitral award was also reserved.
ZCTU members arrested on International Women's Day: Fourteen members of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) Western Region were arrested on Saturday 7 March during commemorations for International Women's Day.
The ten women and four men were cleaning up at Fife Street market as part of the day's activities.
The police arrived, accused them of staging an illegal demonstration and detained them at Bulawayo Police Station for three hours.
The members were only released after the Western Region Paralegal Officer intervened.
Harassment of ZCTU Witness to ILO Commission of Inquiry: On 9 April, agents from Zimbabwe's Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) threatened the chairperson of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) Rusape District branch, Mr Amos Masumuse, with unspecified consequences if he proceeded to testify before the International Labour Organisation's (ILO) Commission of Inquiry.
The CIO officers advised Mr. Masumuse that they would make his life difficult in Rusape unless he relinquished his trade union post.
He was shown a place where a person was murdered during the violent June 2008 elections and told that the same could happen to him.
The ZCTU complained to the Minister of Labour and Social Services.
Arrest and Detention of ZCTU Journalist: On 11 April, Christopher Mahove, a senior reporter for the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) publication 'The Worker', was arrested by police officers and detained at Dzivarasekwa police station in Harare for taking photos of police officers harassing informal traders and looting their wares.
The police officers confiscated Mahove's camera and deleted all the pictures he had taken.
Further to the intervention of a lawyer, on the instructions of the ZCTU, Mahove was released after paying a fine of USD20.
May Day celebrations lead to harassment of ZCTU officer: A Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) official in Hwange, Mr. C. Ncube, was harassed by police for his role in organising May Day celebrations.
He was requested to report to Hwange police station on 2 May, but was advised by a ZCTU paralegal officer to go into hiding since it was a Saturday and the police have a culture of detaining people at weekends.
From 10 to 15 May, Mr Ncube reported to police between 8 am to around 5:30 pm and was not allowed to eat.
No charges were laid against Mr Ncube, but he was subject to abusive questioning.
He was warned that if he did not resign from ZCTU activities, life would be difficult for him in Hwange.
Mass dismissal following strike: The Zimbabwe Mining and Smelting Company, ZIMASCO, based in Kwekwe, dismissed 23 workers, all union officials or members of the Zimbabwe Ferro Alloys Workers Union (ZFAWU), after they took part in a strike on 17 June.
The strike was called in protest of management's failure to provide protective clothing for the workforce.
All the strikers were dismissed, and the case was taken to the Labour Court, which ruled in favour of the company.
However, all employees were reinstated except the trade union officials, including ZFAWU president Shadreck Bvumburai, chairperson Watson Mabhena, and secretary Darlington Mabuto.
Three trade unionists arrested, march disrupted: Three trade unionists were arrested during a commemoration march on 12 September.
The march was organised by the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) to commemorate 13 September 2006, when ZCTU leaders and activists were brutally assaulted while in police custody.
The march was initially banned by the police, but the ZCTU won an order from the High Court allowing the commemoration to go ahead.
On the morning of 12 September, about 40 police officers in riot gear arrived wielding batons and began dispersing the crowd.
Three persons, Jokonia Mawopa, Phillip Gavaza and Juliana Gonhedza, were arrested for holding ZCTU banners.
They were detained for two hours and later released without charge.
On 30 September, the home of Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) Zvishavane District Secretary Ndodana Sithole was raided by police officers.
They demanded to know what action the ZCTU was planning to take.
Brother Sithole was also warned not to meet any Shabanie Mine employees.
The police officers also demanded Alluwis Zhou's cell phone, as they believed it had photos of the shooting incident.
They threatened to abduct Alluwis Zhou's wife if she failed to tell them the whereabouts of her husband and the cell phone.
ZANU PF Threaten ZCTU District Members: In October, in Banket, a ZANU-PF youth (the youth wing of Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front party) activist made threats against members of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU).
The ZCTU reported the threats to the police, but no action was taken.
The names of four ZCTU members also appeared on a short-list prepared by ZANU-PF youth to be sent to a Minister, member of the ZANU-PF party.
Mr. Wonder Nyaupfipa, Mr. Tendenedzeli, Mr. Kabaya and Mr. Chiduwa were to be targeted for unspecified action because of their co-ordination of ZCTU activities, which ZANU-PF view as MDC activities.
Mr. Nyaupfira, the ZCTU district chairperson, was approached by the wife of an army officer demanding that he stop co-ordinating and associating with ZCTU.
Police supervision of trade union activity: On October, the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) notified the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) in Mutare of its intention to commemorate the World Day for Decent Work.
The ZRP sanctioned the commemorations but denied ZCTU Mutare members the right to hold a procession.
The police also demanded to be included in the gathering to listen to the discussions.
Four police officers attended.
Five union leaders arrested: Lovemore Matombo, the president of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU); Michael Kandukutu, ZCTU National Organiser; Percy Mcijo ZCTU Western Regional Officer, Dumisani Ncube, ZCTU Victoria Falls district chairperson; and Nawu Ndlovu were arrested by Victoria Falls police on Sunday 8 November at the Ngqondo Ngqondo Complex in Victoria Falls.
Mr. Matombo was holding a consultative meeting with members of the ZCTU Victoria Falls District in preparation for a labour forum at the same venue the following day.
The police claimed that Mr. Matombo's meeting was illegal because it was not sanctioned by the police, and charged the ZCTU officials under the Public Order and Security Act (POSA).
The five denied the charges.
They appeared in court on the 12 November in Victoria Falls.
The Magistrate ruled in favour of the trade unionists and warned police to respect the law.
The five are suing the State for unlawful arrest and detention.
Police obstruction: On the 14 November, the president of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU), Lovemore Matombo,wanted to address a consultative meeting in Kadoma at Specks Hotel.
Kadoma Police ordered the hotel to cancel the booking unless the ZCTU obtained a clearance letter from police.
The meeting was later moved to Kadoma Ranch Motel.
Some workers failed to attend due to the sudden change of venue.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - USA
The law does not adequately protect workers' trade union rights, and provides the employers with vast freedoms.
Union busting, anti-union campaigning and resistance to collective bargaining and bad-faith bargaining remain common practice amongst employers, this leading to double standards in foreign multinational companies such as Deutsche Telekom.
While basic trade union rights are guaranteed, a number of problematic areas exist in the law.
The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), the private sector labour law, guarantees freedom of association but excludes public sector workers as well as many private sector workers from its scope.
Furthermore, federal employees enjoy limited rights to organise, and public sector workers are only guaranteed freedom of association in some states.
Workers are not adequately protected against acts of anti-union discrimination.
While employers may not directly interfere with the employees' choice to join a union, they may discourage workers from joining by employing various tactics.
Pursuant to a Supreme Court ruling in 2002, undocumented workers are not entitled to back pay or reinstatement for unfair labour practices.
Also, the ongoing "War on Terrorism" has been used as a pretext to significantly roll back labour rights for employees of the U.S. government.
The right to strike is circumscribed by the employers' right to replace striking workers permanently.
Federal workers are not allowed to strike, nor are most state employees.
Finally, there are limitations on the ability of workers to engage in "concerted activity" such as intermittent strikes and secondary boycotts.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Justice ineffective: Remedies for intimidation and coercion, such as the illegal firing of workers who seek to form unions and bargain collectively, are both limited and ineffective.
Many employers who violate labour laws are never punished.
Even when they are, the penalties are too weak to deter them from doing it again.
Construction workers struggle to form union in southwest U.S.: Immigrant painters and drywall finishers in the Phoenix Valley and the Las Vegas area, along with sheet metal workers in Arizona are organizing at a number of companies.
In many cases, residential construction workers in this industry work under harsh working conditions (such as under a payment system called "piece rate," in which they are paid based on the amount of work performed and hence long hours) and face rampant wage and hours violations.
Some have filed lawsuits against the contractors that employ them using not only the federal Fair Labor Standards Act to claim the wages legally owed them, but as well class action lawsuits.
The later ensure that all their coworkers are automatically included in the claim.
The residential construction workers have formed Building Justice, a partnership of the Sheet Metal Workers, International Union of Painters District Council 15, and the AFL-CIO, to help improve standards in their industry and return a sense of fairness and dignity to their jobs.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Venezuela
Violence linked to the fight for jobs continued to be the main reason behind the killing of trade unionists.
Unjustified delays in collective bargaining negotiations were common practice, both in the public and private sectors.
The legislation prevents trade unions from carrying out their activities freely.
Despite constitutional guarantees, trade union rights are not adequately protected.
Workers have the right to form and join trade unions, however the law requires a minimum of 100 members in order to create a union.
It also requires that the union submit full information regarding its members' identity, place of residence together with their signature.
Furthermore, unions are not free to organise their internal administration.
The Constitution requires union constitutions to make their leaders' mandates non-renewable, and foreigners are not allowed to belong to a union's executive body unless they have lived in the country for 10 years.
The Constitution also provides that trade union elections shall be announced, organised, directed and supervised by the National Electoral Council (CNE), which is not a judicial organ.
Finally, the Penal Code undermines, through the application of penalties, the right to hold peaceful demonstrations and the right to strike and block a company's production.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
The government's refusal to engage in social dialogue and establish tripartite consultations on policies affecting workers' conditions and living standards led to numerous trade union protests.
Strategies undermining collective bargaining: Unjustified delays in collective bargaining negotiations were common practice during 2009, both in the public and private sectors, giving rise to many trade union protests.
The delays resulted in the expiry and failure to renew many collective agreements.
By June 2009, 243 collective agreements were left unsigned and over 3,500 agreements had not been discussed.
Collective agreement breached by Metro de Caracas: The Caracas metro workers' union, Sindicato de Trabajadores del Metro de Caracas (Sintrameca), reached a contractual agreement with the state-owned company in 2008.
Following the approval of the referendum on 15 February 2009, the government refused to recognise the agreement and called on the union to hold renewed negotiations, based on the proposals presented by the Transport and Communications Ministry.
This erratic move by the government shows a total disregard for the negotiations that had been held and the agreements in force, as well as attacking the union's right to freely decide on its initiatives and action plan, and undermining the right to collective bargaining.
Collective bargaining violations in education sector: The Education and Labour Ministries have been delaying the launch of negotiations on the Fifth Collective Agreement for the Venezuelan education sector for over two years.
The government finally called the meeting on 8 May 2009, but only invited the union organisations that support the government's policy, Sindicato Nacional de la Fuerza Unitaria del Magisterio (Sinafum), Federación Venezolana de Maestros (FVM), and Federación de Educadores de Venezuela (FEV), and went on to sign a collective agreement with them.
Six other teaching federations (Fetraenseñanza, Fetramagisterio, Fetrasined, Fenaprodo, Feslev and Fenatev) were thus excluded, on the pretext that they had not met the requirements for holding trade union elections and presenting financial reports to the National Electoral Council (CNE).
The organisations excluded pointed out that the agreement signed was later used to advance elements of an Education Act that failed to consider the main actors and was not the product of a wide and inclusive debate.
Multinational tramples workers' rights and refuses to sign collective agreement: During 2009, the Éxito supermarket chain, owned by the French group Casino, showed complete disregard for trade union rights and the workers' calls for decent working conditions, leading its employees to stage a number of protests throughout the year.
On 13 November, a group of workers affiliated to the commercial workers' union, Sindicato de Trabajadores Unidos del Comercio y Afines (Sintruco), gathered to demand that the company respect its rights and sign a collective agreement that had already been under discussion for two years.
Interference in union elections at PDVSA: The Venezuelan petroleum company, Empresa de Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), called on the petroleum and gas workers' federation, Federación Unitaria de Trabajadores del Petróleo, del Gas, sus Similares y Derivados de Venezuela (FUTPV), to hold elections to allow for the launch of collective bargaining talks in the sector, where the collective agreement had expired almost a year prior.
After facing a series of obstacles raised by the National Electoral Council (CNE), the elections were finally held on 1 October 2009.
The negotiations were subsequently initiated but no agreement had been reached by December 2009.
Each European country operates a distinct system of labour legislation and judicial enforcement.
This is often closely linked to the process of collective bargaining and social partner consultation arrangements.
Set out below are brief introductions to the framework of labour laws in a number of European countries followed by examples of primary legislation in English.
FedEE members have access to a more comprehensive range of labour laws through the European HR knowledgebase .
Austrian employment law is based on a clear distinction between blue and white collar workers.
A comprehensive system of collective agreements are in place and workers are obliged to belong to their local chamber of employees which provides them with free legal advice.
Special courts exist to handle labour issues and there is a general ban on dispute resolution through arbitration.
Belgium is a federal state divided into three main semi-autonomous regions - Flanders (Flemish speaking), Wallonia (French and German speaking) and Brussels (mixed linguistic communities).
All competence for making employment laws lies with the federal parliament, although enforcement of these laws is primarily through locally-administered labour courts.
Collective bargaining is the key mechanism by which labour standards are established and maintained.
A multi-industry agreement that creates a formal framework for all collective agreements is concluded every two years.
A plethora of industry agreements exist and many are extended by royal decree to become generally binding to all employers in a particular sector or geographical area.
Collective agreements determine most of the terms and conditions enjoyed by Danish workers.
Employment laws have traditionally existed to provide a framework for collective bargaining and to reinforce the application of resulting agreements.
There has, however, been a marked swing away from dependence upon social partner arrangements and towards the direct application of statutory requirements in the employment field.
In this highly unionised country, terms and conditions are laid down within both a framework of progressive employment laws and a rolling two-yearly incomes policy agreement.
All new laws are subject to extensive consultations with the social partners and collective agreements become generally effective in their sectors if deemed appropriate by a tripartite committee.
The Labour Code (Code du Travail) is the primary basis for labour law.
Sitting astride the code is a large body of legally enforceable rights introduced through collective and works agreements (règlement intérieur).
Most employment contracts are for an open term (contrats à durée indéterminée) and a major legal distinction exists between 'cadres' (top managers) and 'employés' (lower grade staff).
German employment law is not consolidated into a single labour code.
It is based instead on the service contract provisions of the German Civil Code and a plethora of individual statutes.
Collective agreements have full legal status and collective labour law is one of the few areas where judicial precedent has helped to develop a systematic body of rights.
Although not a member of the European Union, Iceland is a signatory of the European Economic Area (EEA) agreement and therefore incorporates all EU employment and social directives into its national laws.
This is the most highly unionised country in Europe and trade unions hold a great deal of political power.
Special permission must be obtained from the Ministry of Social Affairs before redundancies involving four or more employees can take place.
Extensive consultations must also take place with the trade unions to discover if an alternative to labour shedding can be found.
Sex equality is a serious issue, both in labour relations and under Icelandic law.
The same salaries must be paid for work of equal value.
Ireland owes much of its legal system to being formerly part of the United Kingdom.
The Irish government generally adheres to EU social directives and was one of the first to introduce an integrated non-discrimination law giving protection to a wide range of social groups.
Ongoing tripartite agreements exist to sustain growth and control price inflation.
The National Labour Court may issue binding recommendations on pay and conditions in companies where trade union recognition does not exist.
The Italian constitution recognises the central role of work in the social life of the country and there is a strong legal framework for working conditions, the right of association and equality of opportunity.
In Italy there are many different instruments that may be used to introduce a new legal requirement - from 'Decreto Legge' that last for only three months to 'Delega Legislativa' that are frequently mistaken for full legal statutes, but are actually just blueprints for a potential law (Decreto Legislativo).
On top of these parliamentary measures are regulations (regolamento) in five different forms, ranging from 'Derecto del Presidente della Repubblica', which do not require prior authorization by a law, to 'circolare', which simply instruct civil servants how to operate.
In this small, affluent state, collective bargaining is largely at a company level.
The law requires companies that have over 1,000 employees or are more than 25% state-owned to appoint one-third of their board from employee representatives.
Despite this, the government was reluctant to introduce the European Works Councils Directive, and has frequently been at loggerheads with trade unions about issues such as union recognition in the banking industry and working time arrangements in the hotel and catering sectors.
Norway is a signatory of the European Economic Area (EEA) agreement.
It is a highly affluent country with a strong economic reliance on offshore gas and oil.
The government operates a pact with the social partners and there is an ongoing review of working environment legislation.
An important aspect of labour relations is the existence of compulsory mediation to settle disputes.
In spite of its high level of unionisation, Sweden's principal mechanism for establishing employment standards is not collective bargaining, but the law.
The last national accord ended many years ago and collective agreements are now primarily concluded at a sectoral level for rolling two to three-year periods.
Unlike many of its neighbours, Sweden does not operate a system that permits collective agreements to have general effect within their sector.
By continental standards, the UK operates a highly liberal labour market with the minimum of legislative intervention and administrative 'red tape'.
Employment rights have taken shape around the common law of contract and onto this central pillar have been bolted a number of statutory constraints in such spheres as working time, maternity, union rights and minimum pay.
The UK does not have a written constitution and its court system has grown in a rather piecemeal way.
However, specialist employment tribunals are empowered to hear almost all individual disputes and they are an integrated element in the civil court structure.
FedEE provides a practical HR resource for companies operating internationally across Europe, with a focus on employment law, pay and labour relations.
First established with EU funding in 1989, it is now a rapidly-growing independent organisation serving the needs of multinational employers worldwide.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Uganda
The ILO expressed concerns about a reluctance to enforce the respect of trade union rights for fear of deterring foreign investors.
Public sector workers were still not able to negotiate their salaries and employment terms.
Although the labour laws have improved, compulsory arbitration is still in place.
Some issues remain despite basic trade union rights being guaranteed.
In 2006, four labour reform bills were passed, all of which significantly improved labour laws concerning workers' rights.
Employers are barred from interfering in workers' right to organise, and it is a criminal offence to obstruct this right.
The right to collective bargaining is guaranteed under the Labour Unions Act, and the Labour Disputes Act provides for the fast resolution of labour disputes and elevates the Industrial Court to the status of the High Court.
However, section 27 of the latter Act empowers the Minister of Labour to refer a dispute to the Industrial Court if either side does not comply with the recommendations of a board of inquiry, a procedure that is tantamount to compulsory arbitration.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Union rights often not enforced: In November, Uganda was criticised by an ILO representative in the country for failing to protect workers' rights to organise and engage in collective bargaining for fear of offending foreign investors.
These rights were further hampered by heavy bureaucracy, the ILO said.
In a meeting with the Labour Minister in September, the Central Organisation of Free Trade Unions (COFTU) had expressed serious concern about the ill-treatment of workers by foreign investors.
In April, the Labour Minister asked the Chief Justice to appoint a judge to handle the backlog of workers' complaints and disputes in the Industrial Court.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Ukraine
Numerous violations took place throughout the year, with law enforcement bodies offering very little assistance.
The Federation of Trade Unions of Ukraine suffered judicial persecution.
The right to strike is limited, and collective bargaining is not adequately secured.
Numerous problems exist despite basic trade union rights being recognised.
The right to join and form trade unions is guaranteed by the Constitution and the 1999 Act on Trade Unions, and the law provides for extensive penalties for violating trade union rights.
While registered trade unions with national status may participate in the national collective bargaining agreement, the 2004 Model Statutes and Internal Rules for public limited companies stipulate that it is works' councils that have a mandate for collective bargaining.
However, Ukrainian legislation does not provide for the establishment of such councils.
The right to strike is recognised in the Constitution, but a strike can only be organised if two-thirds of the workers in the enterprise vote for it.
Public servants may not strike, and the list of essential services where strikes are prohibited exceeds the ILO definition.
Federations and confederations may not call a strike either.
Finally, workers who strike in prohibited sectors may receive prison terms of up to three years.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Laws disregarded: The Federation of Trade Unions of Ukraine (FPU) has recorded 43 unique cases in 32 companies where the management did not comply with the Law on Trade Unions, Their Rights and Guarantees of Activity.
Violations range from failure to transfer special funds that the companies are obliged to allocate to trade unions, to withdrawal of check-off facilities, to interference with unions' internal matters and obstruction of the work of their representatives, to serious cases of trade union discrimination.
Members of the Confederation of Free Trade Unions of Ukraine (KVPU) have also suffered from anti-union harassment, and their employers often ignored the right to organise and bargain collectively.
KVPU reports that turning to the courts or law enforcement bodies for protection is hardly ever effective, and sometimes the local authorities side with the employers against trade unions.
However, there were also reports on unfairly dismissed trade unionists being reinstated, and KVPU has won over 20 different court cases over the last four years just against one company.
Unfortunately court decisions are poorly enforced.
Judicial persecution of FPU: In different regions of Ukraine, most notably Dnipropetrovsk, Kirovohrad, and Mykolaiv, certain individuals have been filing lawsuits against organisations affiliated to the Federation of Trade Unions of Ukraine (FPU), and against trade union leaders, seeking to reverse trade unions' decisions, suspend the leaders, and dissolve the organisations.
A total of 106 complaints were lodged during the year.
All plaintiffs asked the courts to order the defendants to present internal trade union documents, such as minutes of meetings, certificates and seals, and to review the case without the defendants' participation.
Most lawsuits, even those filed in different courts, were exactly the same, and most plaintiffs were not trade union members.
Many of the claims contained forged addresses, incorrect job titles of the plaintiffs, and false references to the decisions of trade union bodies that allegedly violated the plaintiffs' rights.
Eventually, 104 of the cases were resolved in favour of FPU or its affiliates by 1 December.
However, trade unions had to dedicate considerable time and energy to the legal proceedings, which interfered with normal trade union work.
As the lawsuits were clearly a concerted action without a sound factual basis, trade unions are convinced that this was a campaign to undermine FPU and its affiliates.
Trade unions harassed: The Confederation of Free Trade Unions of Ukraine (KVPU) notes that employers are resistant to the establishment of new trade unions because they consider it a violation of the tradition of workers' obedience, deeply rooted in the communist era.
For example, workers at the agrarian complex Pushcha Vodytsa near Kyiv created an organisation affiliated to the All-Ukrainian trade union Defence of Justice, and it was officially registered before April.
Since according to the law, minority unions do have certain rights, the union asked the management to provide a copy of the existing collective agreement and to organise check-off for trade union dues.
The company director-general simply returned all the correspondence to the union, adding that the organisation simply did not exist.
The employer maintained the same tactics throughout the attempts of the union to achieve recognition.
Moreover, in July, the members of the new trade union committee were summoned to the district police branch and prosecutor's office to give explanations on the creation of the union.
Pressure on the union members decreased following the intervention of the KVPU leadership, but in December, two representatives of the prosecutor's office visited Pushcha Vodytsa and asked many workers for written statements on whether they belonged to the Defence of Justice local organisation or not.
Another example is the KVPU-affiliated Octan trade union in the largest petrol producer in the country, CJSC "Linik".
Management has been threatening union members with dismissal or wage cuts unless they resign from the union, or at least authorise the administration not to transfer their union dues.
The company has also used manipulative tactics such as announcing the redundancy of 244 workers in July while in fact planning significantly fewer lay-offs.
Of seven Octan members to be made redundant in October, four resigned from the union and remained employed while two others were dismissed.The union sought help from the police and prosecutor's offices, but to no avail.
As a result, in just over a year union membership shrunk from 930 to 186.
Unions harassed by prosecutor's offices: On 26 August, the Federation of Trade Unions of Ukraine (FPU) received a copy of the General Prosecutor's Office's representation to the Supreme Court of Ukraine.
The representation, lodged on behalf of the Ministry of Justice as a result of an investigation into FPU's compliance with the national constitution and laws, asked the court for compulsory dissolution of FPU.
FPU immediately forwarded the document to its bodies and affiliates, and the FPU president requested the Prosecutor's Office to clarify the grounds for the representation.
Some FPU affiliates also turned to various prosecutor's offices for an explanation, but the General Prosecutor's Office never confirmed sending the representation.
However, different officers reportedly treated inquiring trade union leaders in a tactless and biased way and tried to manipulate the unionists into giving negative information on trade union activities.
Doubtful lay-offs at customs office: In November, Zoya Chyzhniak, head of the trade union "Spravedlivyst", was fired from the Sumy Regional Customs Office following an investigation that trade unions perceived as biased.
The deputy-head of the union Ihor Nazarenko also lost his job in what appeared to be an artificially created lay-off situation.
This happened after the union, which had already submitted numerous reports on violations of labour law, demanded that the authorities start a thorough disciplinary investigation against the head of the office.
The relations between the management and the union have been strained for years.
The union has been fighting for the implementation of elementary occupational health and safety measures while its activists have been intimidated, humiliated and demoted.
The local labour inspectorate as well as the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy were contacted for assistance, but they did not intervene.
Harassment of unionists widespread: The Federation of Trade Unions (FPU) reports that members of company trade union committees often suffer illegal dismissals, are given unjustified warnings and see their employment conditions changed for the worse.
During the year, such incidents took place at the communal enterprise Lubnykhvodokanal, Motor transport enterprise No.
12327 in Zaporizhia, Afromash-IF LLC, MOU Boiler and Welding Plant No.
63 AU (Ivano-Frankivsk region), Dnipropress Plant PC (Dnipropetrovsk), Metal Constructions Plant PC (Kryvyi Rih), and Kherson Cotton Plant PC.
The management of Metal Constructions Plant also forced workers to leave the union.
There were reports of employers' interference with union activities in the Land Resource State Committee.
Union rights disregarded: At least 17 companies, many of them in the manufacturing sector, withdrew trade union dues from the members' salaries but failed to transfer the money to the trade unions' accounts, using it for the companies' own needs instead.
Furthermore, Kherson Cotton Plant PC and Kharkiv Autogenous Plant PC did not allow elected trade union representatives to enter the company premises.
NDPISiU LLC in Dnipropetrovsk also refused to provide the union with any company-related information, while the Oleksandria branch of Energovugillia (Dnipropetrovsk) refused to bargain collectively.
Employment at DU is at will, meaning that the employee or DU may terminate the employment relationship at any time, for any or no reason, with or without advance notice.
Except as may be provided in a written contract signed by an authorized representative of the University, no employee has a guarantee or promise of employment with the University for any specific period of time.
Further, no one has authority to make an agreement with any employee of the University concerning such employee’s length of employment except in writing.
Staff members must notify their supervisor for permission to take time off no less than one week in advance of their desire to observe a religious holiday.
This time may, at the option of the employee, be taken off without pay, or charged to the vacation accumulation, or with the supervisor’s permission, be made up through an alternative work schedule It is expected that the time off be granted by the supervisor, unless such accommodation would create an undue hardship.
The University defines exempt and non-exempt employees in accordance with the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), and otherwise is subject to the requirements of the FLSA.
“Exempt” employees are not eligible for overtime pay.
“Non-exempt” employees receive overtime pay in accordance with the Overtime policy.
Non-exempt Employee - Non-exempt employees are eligible for paid overtime at one and one-half times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of 12 hours per day and/or 40 hours per workweek.
Non-benefited employees are paid bi-weekly.
The University does not have a formal disciplinary policy for non-union employees.
The University of Denver’s objective for disciplinary action is to correct violations, improve performance, avoid recurrence, and protect the interests of the University.
It is impossible to provide an exhaustive list that identifies every type of conduct or performance problem that may result in some form of discipline.
However, in some instances, circumstances may warrant immediate disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.
If a University employee has any questions regarding a disciplinary process, or if they feel discipline is unwarranted, the employee should discuss the matter with his or her department head, deans and vice chancellors, or the Office of Human Resources.
Only appointed employees will be compensated at their regular rate of pay if the University is officially closed.
In these instances, pay will not be computed as time worked for overtime purposes.
The University supports the principles of flex time for its employees in order to allow employees to maintain a work/life balance and better service to the public.
It is the policy of the University to encourage each employing department to approve the reasonable requests of employees for alternative work schedules when such requests are consistent with the needs of the department to accomplish its objectives.
The University retains the right to specify certain designated work schedules affecting employees or groups of employees.
Flex time may be changed or reversed to standard hours by the approving supervisor as needed to meet department needs.
Daily or weekly schedules may be changed from time to time at the discretion of the University to meeting varying business conditions.
A meal period of not less than thirty minutes (off duty, unpaid time) is required, if an employee works for a period of more than five hours.
When a work period of not more than six hours will complete the day's work, the meal period shall be optional.
If for some reason an employee is required to remain in the work area all day (e.g.
to answer phone calls, handle walk-in inquiries, etc.
), an "on duty" meal period will be permitted, which shall be paid time and counted as time worked for overtime purposes.
No applicant shall be rejected and no employee shall be restricted in matters of pay, promotion, work assignment, working conditions, or any other factor solely as a result of a familial relationship with any other employee at the University of Denver.
The provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act govern compensation for overtime hours worked.
Employees eligible for overtime pay must receive prior authorization to work overtime from their department or budgetary manager.
Overtime is time worked in excess of 40 hours in a workweek or time worked in excess of 12 hours in a workday.
A workweek is defined as Sunday through Saturday.
Nonexempt employees will receive overtime pay at 1.5 times the hourly rate.
Compensatory time is illegal in the private sector.
Compensatory time is defined as allowing a non-exempt employee to take time off in-lieu-of being paid for overtime.
Contact the Office of Human Resources at x17420 for further information on this issue.
Any employee who voluntarily terminated employment with the University in good standing is eligible for reemployment.
The record of prior employment must indicate that the employee's performance met acceptable standards.
In any particular case of staff level reduction, the functional needs of the University, the department and the ability and qualifications to perform the work will determine which employee(s) will be terminated.
When ability and qualifications are equal, seniority may be considered.
If the holiday falls on a Saturday, it will be observed on Friday.
If it falls on a Sunday, the holiday will be observed on Monday.
Paid holidays do not count toward the payment of overtime.
Leave with pay is available to all appointed exempt and non-exempt (non-faculty) staff because of death in the immediate family.
Immediate family is limited to: spouse of employee; father or mother of employee or spouse; child of employee or spouse; brother or sister of employee or spouse; grandparent of employee or spouse.
Funeral leave will be limited to three days if the burial is within Colorado, and to five days if outside of Colorado.
The supervisor may request an obituary or other notice to substantiate the absence.
Bereavement pay will not be computed as time worked for overtime purposes.
Leave is available to all appointed employees.
Leave with pay shall be granted for the duration of such duty.
When the summons for jury duty is received, it should be presented to the employee's supervisor.
The employee is expected to report to work, if excused from jury duty during normal work hours.
The supervisor may require the employee to furnish documentation from the court clerk as to days served.
Any jury duty fees received may be retained by the employee.
Jury duty pay will not be computed as time worked for overtime purposes.
Leave for appointed employees may be utilized for doctor and hospital visits, new child care, personal illness or injury, or illness or injury in the employee's immediate family (father, mother, father-in-law, mother-in-law, grandparents, spouse, or child).
Sick leave accrues at a rate of 12 days per year or 1 day per month to a maximum of 130 days.
Leave accrual is prorated for part-time employees.
Sick pay will not be computed as time worked for overtime purposes.
Time off from work for class attendance should be made up within the same work week (Monday through Sunday) by those employees subject to the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act, or taken as vacation or unpaid leave.
It is the purpose of the faculty-staff tuition waiver program to assist employees and their dependents in gaining further college level and advanced education.
Therefore, attendance at regularly scheduled classes offered at the University of Denver is encouraged.
Vacation benefits accrue for non-faculty, appointed employees, based on the length of employment.
Full-time staff accrue vacation leave at the rate of 15 days per year, or 1.25 days per month, to a maximum accrual of 15 days.
Vacation leave accrual is prorated for staff employees who work less than full-time.
Vacation leave accrual increases after completion of seven years of service at the University to 2 days per month, up to a maximum accrual of 22 days in the aggregate.
Vacation pay will not be computed as time worked for overtime purposes.
The Department of Risk Management is ready to assist all University departments in treating loss exposures and aid in implementing loss prevention programs to limit these potential losses.
(See http://www.du.edu/risk/).
The Environmental Health and Safety Department provides environmental and occupational safety programs designed to protect the health and safety of DU employees.
The Director of Environmental Health and Safety must be notified before any inspections from regulatory authorities including OSHA, the Colorado Department of Health and Environment (CDHE), and the Denver Fire Department (DFD).

2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Serbia
Several companies have exhibited anti-union behaviour, and have resorted to insults, harassment, threats of dismissal and refusal to bargain collectively.
At least one person lost his job because of his union activities.
The labour law hampers union formation as well as legitimate trade union activities.
Trade union rights are limited despite some constitutional guarantees.
The procedures for registering a union are very complicated, and authorisation is required from the Ministry of Labour.
To be recognised as a collective bargaining agent, a union needs to comprise 15% of the workforce.
In addition, section 233 of the Labour Law imposes a time period of three years before a new organisation, or a union which has failed to obtain recognition, may seek a decision on representativeness.
Furthermore, the right to strike is heavily restricted, as parties to a collective agreement must submit their disputes to compulsory arbitration, which is also the case for disputes in services of general interest.
A minimum service must be provided in strikes in "essential services", the notion of which is very broad.
The procedures for determining the minimum service are set out in government regulations and can even lead to a total ban on strike action.
Finally, the law provides for the suspension not only of wages, but also of social security rights of striking workers.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Organising discouraged: Workers who wish to form a trade union are often forced to take the employer's "advice" not to unionise, or else face persecution.
The Confederation of Autonomous Trade Unions (CATUS) has reported numerous examples of anti-union tactics.
In 2009, trade unionists at MINEL-ELIP in Belgrade were subjected to psychological harassment and dismissal threats.
Following the beating of a trade union president in 2008, the workers have been in constant fear of reprisals for their union activities.
The management of Univerzal Iskra in Baric also threatened the trade union leader with dismissal, and pressured workers to leave the union.
Labour inspectorates do not always make an effort to stop anti-union behaviour.
Unionists blackmailed and denied bargaining: Since January, the management of Interlemind, in Leskovac, has been blackmailing trade unionists by using threats of dismissal.
The company has also refused to bargain collectively.
In September, trade unions reported that insults from management had intensified.
Unionist dismissed, company prohibits union activities: On 25 August, Zlatko Francuski, a board member of the trade union at Gorenje Tiki, in Stara Pazova, was dismissed in connection with his trade union activities.
More dismissals were reported later, and the management has prohibited any trade union activities within the company.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Kosovo
Workers' and trade union rights violations are not uncommon.
Two healthcare professionals lost their jobs in connection with their trade union activities.
Large gaps remain in the labour legislation as important laws failed to materialise in 2009.
The labour legislation is in transition.
The 2008 Constitution guarantees the freedom to establish and join trade unions, and the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) regulation 2001/27 on the Essential Labour Law of Kosovo stipulates basic trade union rights.
However, a draft Labour Law scheduled to be passed in March 2009 has not yet been adopted, which is also the case for the Law on Trade Union Organisations and the Law on Strikes.
UNMIK regulation 2001/27 provides for the right to collective bargaining at the national, sectoral and enterprise levels, and the maximum duration of collective agreements is set to three years.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Anti-union employers: Workers' rights are violated in every sector, including in international organisations.
Only a small number of companies respect rules prohibiting anti-union discrimination, and sometimes workers are prevented from joining trade unions.
Union activists dismissed: Two members of the Federation of Healthcare Trade Unions lost their jobs in connection with their union activities.
Begzad Dërmaku, previously employed by a public health care institution in Kamenica and Nazif Reka, previously employed by a public health care institution in Kaçanik, challenged their dismissals in courts.
Reka won in the first and second court instances, but his employer made a further appeal.
2009 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Serbia
Trade unionists were harassed and manipulated by employers, with two women falling victim to very disrespectful physical attacks.
A number of restrictions on the right to organise and the right to strike persist.
Authorisation required: All workers except military and police officers have the right to join and form a trade union.
Trade unions must be registered in accordance with regulations issued by the Ministry of Labour.
The procedure is very complicated, and is handled by the Ministry itself.
The Ministry not only receives documentation, but it also must give its consent, which is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.
Leaders of the company-level trade unions must be full-time employees at the time of registration and provide a certificate issued by their employer.
Collective bargaining and the right to organise: The right to bargain collectively is provided by law and exercised in practice.
All workers with the exception of those in the army and the police can bargain collectively, however, the law stipulates a maximum duration of three years for collective agreements covering the public administration.
A company-level trade union needs to comprise 15 per cent of the workforce in order to be recognised as a representative bargaining agent.
The Labour Law of 2005 prohibits discrimination on the basis of trade union membership.
However, the law does not expressly prohibit obstructing trade union activities and establishes no specific sanctions for anti-union harassment.
Right to strike strongly limited: The right to strike is recognised, although it is restricted for employees in "essential services", who must give at least 15 days' advance warning of strike action and must provide a minimum service.
The notion of essential services is very broad and in practice covers 50 per cent of all workers, including teachers and postal workers.
The procedures for defining minimum services in the essential services are set out in government regulations and in practice may lead to a total ban on strike action, as happened in the case of JAT Airways in 2005, when all international traffic and 30 per cent of domestic traffic had to be guaranteed.
Strike action cannot be undertaken if parties to a collective agreement do not reach an agreement.
The dispute is then subject to compulsory arbitration.
Furthermore, the law on strikes states that participation in a strike can lead to suspension, not only of wages, but also of social security rights – which should be independent of the right to strike.
The law on Peaceful Settlement of Labour Disputes provides for compulsory arbitration in services of general interest, such as electricity distribution, water supply, public radio and television, postal and telecommunication services, public utilities, basic food production, health and veterinary protection, education, childcare and social protection.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2008
Background: Under pressure to address the impact of the crisis, the government threatened to suspend the General Collective Agreement, which had been signed by CATUS and Nezavisnost with the employers' association in April 2008.
After a series of protest actions the government agreed to engage in social dialogue, which led to a six-month postponement of the financial clauses in the agreement.
Organising discouraged: Workers who wish to form a trade union are often forced to take an employer's "advice" not to unionise, or else face persecution.
The ITUC-affiliated Confederation of Autonomous Trade Unions (CATUS) reports anti-union tactics such as abusive transfers, dismissals and demotions of trade unionists.
Termovent – woman trade union leader slapped and then forced to resign: In 2007, the Termovent company owed huge debts, including a total of 113 unpaid salaries.
The trade union confederation Nezavisnost (affiliated to the ITUC) and its metalworkers' branch managed to convince the Ministry of the Economy and Development to adopt a special programme for mitigating the impact of collective redundancies.
This programme allocated special funds that the company had to transfer to workers' accounts by 11 February.
From the moment the ministry's documents were signed, the company's trade union leader Lela Milicev was threatened that she would not be given the funds unless she resigned.
She was even assaulted in public and hospitalised.
Even though Milicev reluctantly signed a resignation letter, she did not receive her funds.
The police opened an investigation.
Eco Fisher – another activist assaulted: At the Eco Fisher factory (town of Smerdevska Palanka) over ten trade union members were locked in the meeting room after the management tried to disrupt a trade union meeting.
Slavica Knezevic, of Nezavisnost's Public Services Trade Union, was physically assaulted.
A surveillance camera was later installed to monitor every step taken by the union president and vice-president.
The management went on to prohibit all trade union activities.
Eurofoil – workers forced to relinquish trade union membership but are dismissed nonetheless: On 12 December, at the polyester foil factory owned by the Eurofoil company, several Nezavisnost members were individually given a pre-typed letter of "irrevocable withdrawal" from Nezavisnost by the CEO.
Each one was told that his/her fellow unionists had already signed such forms, and that leaving Nezavisnost was a pre-requisite for keeping their jobs.
Another worker was similarly pressured into leaving Nezavisnost by his shift foreman.
On 26 December, the workers were made redundant.
Germany is a federal state made up of 16 states (Bundesländer), to which self government is guaranteed except as otherwise provided by the Basic Law.
Federal law takes precedence over state law (Art.
31). According to Art.70 (and following) of the Basic Law, the States have the right to legislate, except on subjects for which the Federal State enjoys exclusive legislative power (for example on foreign affairs and defence).
Civil law, law of association and labour law are inter alia matters which the Basic Law has left under the concurrent legislative power of the Federal and State legislatures.
The States thus have law making power to the extent that the Federal legislature has not exercised its right to legislate.
In Practice, civil law, law of association and other labour laws are entirely governed by Federal Law.
The States nevertheless influence the adoption and amendment of the above-mentioned Acts, because they take part in the legislative procedure.
The major sources of labour law are Federal legislation, collective agreements, works agreements and case law.
There is not one consolidated Labour Code; minimum labour standards are laid down in separate Acts on various labour related issues, which are supplemented by the government's ordinances.
The Act on Collective Agreements adopted on 25.08.1969 and last amended on 29.10.1974 governs collective agreements.
Occupational safety and health, and conditions of work: Maternity Protection Act; Ordinance on Maternity Protection at the Workplace; Young Workers Protection Act; Working Time Act; Act on the Payment of Child Raising Benefit and Child Raising Leave; Insolvency Ordinance
Collective agreements (Tarifverträge) are legally binding as long as they keep in line with the statutory minimum standards.
They are usually concluded at the branch level by the appropriate trade union and employers' association and hence cover one branch (or parts of it) and either a region or the entire country.
However, sometimes collective bargaining also takes place at the enterprise level.
In 1999, 8% of employees in Western Germany and 11% of those in Eastern Germany fell under an enterprise-based collective agreement (source: IAB Betriebspanel).
Collective agreements are always binding for members of the relevant trade union and employers' association.
Provided certain conditions are met, the binding power can be extended to all employees of the branch in the respective region.
In 1999, 65% of employees in Western Germany and 46% of those in Eastern Germany were covered by a branch-level collective agreement (source: IAB-Betriebspanel).
Because of the German membership in the European Union (EU), labour law is strongly influenced by EU legislation and case law.
EU Directives must be implemented and EU jurisprudence has legal binding power.
Every full-time employee who has been employed for at least 6 months in the same establishment can request to work part-time (sec.
8 para.
1). The employer shall accept this request unless he/she regards the request as not feasible in view of operational reasons such as when the reduction of working time may have negative impact on the organization, work flow or safety, or would lead to excessive costs.
Other acceptable reasons for refusal may be specified by collective agreements.
Temporary employment exists when a business (namely a temporary work agency) employs an individual on a permanent basis and dispatches him/her temporarily to another employer (the user enterprise).
The employee works during this period under the supervision and in line with the instructions of the user enterprise.
If the dispatching of employees is not only occasional but on a long term basis, which is assumed in case of a dispatching period longer than 12 months, it is considered commercial.
Commercial dispatching is permitted only under the strict preconditions of the Act on the Commercial Transfer of Employees.
First, the business of the temporary work agency needs permission by the Federal Institute of Employment.
Secondly, the dispatched worker must be employed on a permanent basis except for under particular circumstances when a non-renewable fixed-term contract is justified.
Dispatched employees are entitled to maternity protection, parental leave, continued payment of remuneration in case of sickness, 24 days of holiday (including Saturdays), social insurance and statutory redundancy provisions.
Home work : Home workers enjoy to a large extent the same rights as other employees, as provided for by the Home Work Act adopted on 14 March 1951 and last amended 16 December 1997.
For example, home workers are represented mainly by home work committees, which consist of three members each of employers and home workers and a chairperson appointed by the competent labour authority.
A home work committee supports the conclusion of collective agreements.
If a trade union does not exist in certain fields of activity, minimum standards for remuneration and working conditions are set by the home work committee (sec.
19).
Vocational training contracts that primarily intend to train young people in a profession are not considered contracts of employment.
They are governed by the Occupational Training Act, which, however, provides in sec.
3 para.
2 that the rules and principles governing the contract of employment must be applied, unless the Act expressly states an exception, or when the application of labour law would not be compatible with the nature and aim of the vocational training being undertaken.
When employees are on a legal strike or the employer decides on a justified lock out, the mutual duties under the contract of employment are suspended, so that employees do not have to work and the employer is not obliged to pay wages.
During industrial action, trade union members normally receive strike assistance, which is paid by the trade union and of which the amount is 2/3 of the gross income.
Other employees who are directly affected by the strike receive social security payments from the State.
In case of temporary lay off (e.g.
lack of orders or bad weather), the mutual contractual duties are not entirely suspended, but collective agreements or work agreements may provide for short-time work with corresponding wage reductions.
However, such a measure cannot be unilaterally ordered by the employer.
German labour law makes a distinction between ordinary termination (with notice), whereby the employment relationship is ended when the period of notice expires (sec.
622 Civil Code), and extraordinary termination (without notice).In the latter type of termination, the notification effects the immediate cancellation of the employment relationship (sec.
626 Civil Code).
In both cases, termination at the initiative of the employer is limited by law.
Periods of notice are stipulated by the law.
The minimum statutory period is four weeks, and it is increased by one month each time the worker has completed his/her 5 th, 8 th, 10 th , 12 and 15 th year of working for the same employer.
The maximum entitlement is seven months, after the worker has completed 20 years of service.
However, years of service before the employee is 25 years old are not taken into consideration to calculate his/her entitlement to notice.
Collective agreements may specify longer or shorter periods of notice, whereas individual contracts of employment may only specify longer periods of notice.
As of 1st May 2000, notice must be given in writing in order to have legal effect.
Extraordinary dismissal is legally possible where there is an important reason which makes it, in good faith, unacceptable to continue the employment relationship until the end of the notice period, or in the case of a fixed-term contract of employment, the contractual date for its expiration.
Typically it applies to serious misconduct, and is only possible within two weeks as of the moment when the notifying party learns about the facts that are decisive to terminate the employment relationship.
In case of litigation the same party will be required to prove the facts on which the extraordinary termination is based.
For more detailed information on termination procedures, and remedies in case of unjustified termination please see the Termination of Employment Digest.
In general, working time is defined as the time from the beginning until the end of work without breaks (secs.
2 para1 WTA and 4 para.1 (YWPA).
The legal working time is 8 hours per day, except for Sunday and statutory holidays, which are normally foreseen as a resting period (secs.
3 and 9 WTA).
The statutory weekly working time is thus 48 hours but in many cases it is reduced to between 38,5 and 35 hours by collective agreements.
In 1999 the average agreed working week was 37.4 hours in West Germany and 39.2 hours in East Germany(Source: Federal Ministry of Labour ).
The daily working time of 8 hours must not be exceeded, if it concerns expectant and nursing mothers (sec.
8 MPA).
The same applies to employees or trainees under 18 years (sec.
8 YWPA).
There is also a ban on young workers working on Saturday (sec.
16 YWPA).
In all other cases, the regular daily working time may be extended up to 10 hours, only if the mean of the daily working time in the following 6 months is 8 hours per day (sec.3 WTA).
This encourages flexibility of working time, even though 11 hours of uninterrupted rest after daily work must be guaranteed (sec.
5 para.
1 WTA).
Also night work is legally permitted only under some strict preconditions (see secs.
6 and 7 WTA).
This issue is regulated by the Federal Paid Leave Act, and by collective agreements.
The statutory minimum leave entitlement is 24 days per calendar year, not counting Sundays and public holidays (sec.
3 paras.
1 and 2).
Saturdays are thus included in the calculation.
Further days of paid leave may be added by the particular collective agreement.
In fact, a period of 4 up to 6 weeks per calendar year is usually granted by collective agreements.
For those employees whose employment relationships fall under the scope of any collective agreements reached in 1999, 80% of West German employees and 55% of East German employees can claim paid leave of 6 weeks or more.
Compared to the period from 1974 until 1999 an increase can be noticed.
(Source: Federal Ministry of Labour )
The principle of equal treatment is laid down as a basic right of the Basic Law (Art.
3 paras.
1, 2 and 3 and Art.
9 para.
3). Any discrimination on grounds of sex, race, nationality, handicap, religion, political opinion and trade union activities is inadmissible.
This basic right was taken over by jurisdiction as a fundamental principle of labour law, the so-called principle of equal treatment under labour law.
Unjustified unequal treatment of employees is thus unlawful.
However, in favour of contractual freedom, this prohibition does not apply prior to the establishment of an employment relationship.
Actual pay is determined in the individual contract of employment, but cannot be lower than the minimum wage established in the relevant collective agreement.
Unlike many other countries, there is not a statutory minimum wage in Germany.
An association within the meaning of the Basic Law is a voluntary permanent joining together, which must not be limited to one firm.
Additionally, any association must regard itself as a representative of either the employees or the employers and must explicitly work towards the conclusion of collective agreements.
There is no trade union law in Germany.
Even though trade unions are generally defined as associations with no legal capacity, they are legally entitled to collectively bargain as well as to take legal action or to be taken to court (sec.
2 para 1 Act on Collective Agreements and sec.
10 Labour Court Act).
The duties and rights of trade union members are laid down in the relevant trade union's constitution.
Even though the constitutions may vary between different trade unions, they traditionally establish similar essential duties and rights.
Members are obliged to pay union dues, of which the amount is based on the individual wage level.
At the same time, they are entitled to support in labour disputes as well as to legal advice.
The membership only ends by termination at the worker's initiative or by exclusion on the basis of the trade union's decision, which must be in accord with its constitution.
Most collective agreements are negotiated at the branch or industry level.
On 19 March 2001, the world’s largest industry-based federation, the German Unified Services Union "ver.di" was founded.
It unifies three million members and is a merger of five trade unions: the German Union for Salaried Employees (DAG), the German Post and Telecom Trade Union for Public Services (DPG), the Trade Union for Commerce, Banking and Insurance (HBV), the Trade Union for Public Services, Transport and Traffic (ÖTV) and the Industry Trade Union for Media, Printing and Paper, Journalism and Arts (IGMedien).
Ver.di is, together with seven other industry based federations, e.g.
the Metalworkers Union (IGMetall), a member of the German Confederation of Trade Unions (DGB).
The DGB is the most important central confederation.
Trade unions of the public service and privatized service sector mostly join the German Civil Service Federation (DBB), a much smaller umbrella organization.
Collective bargaining is regulated by the Act on Collective Agreements, which, however, does not mandate a given structure of collective bargaining.
The legal capacity to collectively bargain is possessed by the trade unions on the one hand and the employer's associations as well as the individual employer on the other (sec.
2 para.
1). In fact, collective bargaining mostly takes place at the branch level, even though, in some cases, trade unions may also bargain with the individual employer, provided that it is permitted by their constitutions.
A prohibition of the employer’s organization against individual collective bargaining of its members does not affect the validity of the collective agreement but results in the employer’s duty to pay damages.
the protective function (setting minimum labour standards),
and the peacekeeping function (as long as the collective agreement remains in force new demands and labour disputes about included topics are absolutely banned (industrial peace)).
Any collective agreement is a contract, which consists of two parts (sec.
1 para.
1). The first part, part under the law of contracts, deals with rights and duties of the contractual partners.
The two main obligations of the partners are industrial peace and the duty to use all means available to ensure that their members abide by the agreement.
An arbitration agreement (explained under Strike and lock outs) may also be added.
The second part of the collective agreement sets rules related to labour contracts, to operational questions and to the works constitution within the meaning of the Works Constitution Act.
This distinction is important for the collective agreement's period of validity.
Generally, a collective agreement ends when the period of time expires for which the agreement was concluded.
It may be terminated earlier at one party's legal initiative or by mutual agreement.
In any case, the part under the law of contract necessarily ends at the same time.
Unlike this, the legal norms setting part stays in force until it is replaced by either an individual contractual agreement or a works agreement or in particular by legal norms of a new collective agreement (sec.
4 para.5).
Concerning personal validity, a collective agreement is basically binding for those who, at the time of its coming into force, are members of the relevant trade union and employers' association.
Its rules are thus applicable to the individual employment relationship, if the employee as well as the employer are bound (sec.
3 para.
1). However, the employer's commitment is sufficient for the application of legal norms related to operational questions or to the works constitution (sec.
3 para.
2).
A collective agreement may be declared as generally applicable to all employment relationships within its geographical scope, whether or not the employer or the employee are members of the parties to the agreement.
This is done by the Ministry of Labour, if at least 50 per cent of the employees who come under the agreement's geographical scope are hired by employers already bound by the agreement.
It also requires the accordance of both industrial partners and must be of public interest.
Workers' representation in the enterprise is governed by the Works Constitution Act.
This Act is decisively based on the term establishment.
An establishment is the organizational unit in which the entrepreneur alone or together with his staff pursues particular working objectives.
In an establishment regularly employing five or more employees, its employees may decide to elect a works council, of which the period of office is four years (sec.
21). In practice, works councils are set up especially in medium size and big enterprises, and much more rarely in small enterprises: In 1999, works councils were organized in 97.5 per cent of establishments employing more than 1,000 workers, but only in 4.2 % of establishments employing from 5 to 20 employees.
The works council has rights of participation as well as of co-determination.
The right of participation includes the right to be informed and to make recommendations.
The right of co-determination is by far of much more practical consequence, because it entails the possibility of blocking a decision of the employer which is dependant on the works council's agreement.
It covers subjects such as work rules, working time including overtime and holiday roster, methods of pay, the introduction and use of technical devices for monitoring employees' conduct and performance, accident prevention and health protection, fringe benefits and the provision and withdrawal of company-owned housing.
However, wages must never be determined at the establishment level (Secs.
87 para.
1 and 77 para.3).
The works council and the employer agree within the limits of an applying collective agreement often by concluding a written works agreement (sec.
77 para.
2). They must co-operate on the basis of mutual trust (sec.
74). Industrial action is thus prohibited in the event of a disagreement.
Any dispute must be settled by legal proceedings either leading to a court order or resulting in a decision of a conciliation committee.
The conciliation committee is set up in case of disagreements in matters of co-determination.
It is composed of an independent chairperson and an equal number of employer's and employees' representatives.
Workers' representation may also exist at the enterprise level via a central works council, that deals with enterprise related matters.
Its setting up is mandatory if the enterprise has several establishments with existing works councils.
This body is composed of representatives of manual and non-manual workers who are sent by the affected works councils.
Its period of office is unlimited.
The extent of the workers' representation and impact within the supervisory board is governed by 4 different acts, namely the Co-determination Act of the Coal, Iron and Steel Industries, the Coal, Iron and Steel Co-determination Amendment Act, the 1952 Works Constitution Act and the 1976 Co-determination Act.
They differ in their scope of application and in their regulations.
However, they all assure limited voting rights of the employees' representatives on the supervisory board.
If the company is part of a combine led by another company, where co-determination is not legally mandated, the employees' participation in decision making is nevertheless safeguarded.
A strike can be called exclusively by a trade union.
It can be used only as a last resort when other means for reaching agreement, especially the arbitration procedure, have been exhausted (principle of commensurability).
For the most part, trade unions and employer's associations have voluntary agreed on the duty of taking part in an arbitration procedure before any industrial action, even though a compulsory state arbitration does not exist.
For such a procedure, a neutral person is appointed who is charged with the harmonizing of the controversial demands.
The preparation of a strike also must be in line with guidelines set by most of the trade unions, namely the DGB as a confederation and the DAG.
Key elements of these guidelines are firstly strike ballots before passing a strike resolution and secondly strike pickets, which at any rate must not prevent the work of those who are willing to work.
Strikes must never be directed against those collective agreements that are still in force.
They also should be aimed at the conclusion of a new collective agreement.
Employees therefore may strike only for objectives, which in principle can be part of a collective agreement ( prohibition on e.g.
political strikes).
It must also apply the rules of a fair fight.
Maintenance and emergency work thus have to be carried on during a strike.
The employment law jurisdiction, which includes also trade union disputes, is governed by the Labour Court Act.
There are three instances, namely Local Labour Courts, Regional Labour Courts and the Federal Labour Court as the final instance.
Disputes in terms of works constitution law are part of another proceeding.
They are leading to a court order, which permits only restrictively amicable settlements.
Proceedings concerning an individual employment relationship or any appeal of one by either side of the dispute lead to a judgement.
They always start with a conciliatory hearing, because the Local Labour Court's first intention is an amicable settlement of the case.
Proceedings for protection against dismissal are also given priority in the first instance (sec.
61a). For any details, please refer to the publication, Termination of Employment Digest.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Albania
There were further attacks on trade union property, and new cases of anti-union harassment.
Basic trade union rights are secured, however all civil servants are prohibited from taking strike action.
Although the labour law does not contain areas of serious concern, problems still exist.
Workers are guaranteed freedom of association in the Constitution and the Labour Code, except for senior government officials.
Whereas anti-union dismissals are prohibited by law, workers are not awarded effective protection as the burden of proof lies with the victim and reinstatement can only be ordered for public administration employees.
The right to strike is restricted, as civil servants, regardless of their function, are not allowed to strike.
Furthermore, solidarity strikes are only permitted where the employer of the solidarity strikers has been actively supporting the other employer.
The list of "essential services" where strikes are banned exceeds the ILO definition by including workers in the prison service.
Also, if a strike is considered unlawful, the employer can order strikers to return to work within three days or face dismissal.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Anti-union employers: Although the official data of the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities shows that only eight cases of trade union discrimination were reported during the last five years, the Confederation of Trade Unions of Albania (KSSH) reports that employers' anti-union behaviour is much more widespread, and includes transfers, demotions, wage cuts and dismissals.
While the victims of anti-union dismissals have been able to challenge the employer's actions in court and have received compensation of up to one year's salary, the law gives them no right to be reinstated or re-engaged in their previous jobs.
Earlier, Albanian trade unions had reported that courts were overloaded and it took around three years to review cases of anti-union harassment.
Activists' family members targeted: The Confederation of Trade Unions of Albania, KSSH, reports an alarming trend of targeting workers for their family members' trade union activities.
Spouses, siblings and parents of trade union representatives have been made redundant.
The wife of the KSSH president, Mr. Kol Nikollaj, was dismissed from her job without any reason, and the KSSH suspects that it was an act of retaliation against its president's activities.
The wife of the head of the Federation of Agriculture, Trade and Tourism was also sacked under similar circumstances.
Unionists transferred and forced to take wage cuts: Three local leaders of the Federation of Industry Trade Unions (affiliated to KSSH) were targeted for their trade union activities.
Mr. Misir Kumria, the president of the energy sector trade union in Tirana, and Ms. Anila Tucilla, the president of the energy sector union in Shkorda, were transferred and had to take wage cuts.
Mr. Jonuz Hysa, the president of the energy sector union in Librazh, was reinstated in his previous post after trade unions protested against his transfer.
Trade union offices – still no solution, new attacks on property: In 2006, two national trade union centres – BSPSH and KSSH – were evicted from their headquarters following a court decision on property restitution (see the 2007 and 2008 editions of the Survey).
The trade unions' office equipment and documents were also destroyed in the process.
The government promised to find a solution and provide trade unions with alternative premises, however those promises were not kept.
On 19 August, Albanian President Sali Berisha announced that a bill on expropriation of all the property of Albanian trade unions was being drafted and should be passed into law within three months.
The Parliament finally adopted the law while the unions appealed to the Constitutional court against it.
Trade unionists in public service harassed: Four heads of trade union councils in the civil defence system, members of the Federation of Civil Defence Workers, were fired during the year in connection with their trade union membership.
Six local leaders of the Union of Police Services were demoted for anti-union reasons.
2008 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Albania
Basic trade union rights are recognised in the law; however, union activities are frequently obstructed.
Strike restrictions in the civil service and public utilities are too broad by international standards.
In August the police forced the two national confederations out of their offices, causing damage to trade union property.
There were reports of employers' anti-union behaviour and persecution of trade unionists who disclosed the use of child labour in the companies.
Basic rights protected: The Constitution grants everyone the right to organise for any lawful purposes.
Employees have the right to form and join trade unions in full freedom to defend their occupational and employment interests.
Military personnel and senior government officials do not have the right to organise.
According to the Labour Code, a trade union must comprise at least 20 founding members in order to be registered.
Dismissal because of trade union membership is prohibited and victims are entitled to compensation equivalent to one year's pay on top of other compensations that may be due.
Employers who put pressure on workers not to join a union can face fines of up to 50 times the monthly minimum wage.
The Minister of Labour may extend a sector-level collective agreement to all the employers in the sector concerned.
If the parties fail to reach agreement, they may take advantage of mediation or arbitration procedures.
Arbitration is compulsory in the essential services.
Right to strike: The Labour Code grants trade unions the right to strike for the purpose of solving their economic and social demands.
Employers are not allowed to seek outside labour to replace the striking workers.
If the strike is considered unlawful, the employer can issue a back-to-work order, and the workers who fail to resume the work within three days can be summarily dismissed.
Trade unions can be held responsible for damages caused by an unlawful strike.
Civil servants, regardless of their function, do not have the right to strike.
According to the ILO, the right to strike can only be denied to civil servants exercising authority in the name of the State, or to those in essential services.
Strikes are forbidden in the essential services listed in the Labour Code: indispensable medical and hospital services, water supply services, electricity supply services, air traffic control services, services of protection from fire as well as services at prisons.
These fall within the ILO definition of essential services, although the ILO also states that workers in those services performing nonessential functions should be exempt from the prohibition.
Trade unions must ensure minimum services in the sectors satisfying the basic needs of population, and if there is no agreement between the employer and trade union on the scope of minimum services, the solution will be imposed by an arbitrator appointed by the Minister of Labour and Social Affairs.
Trade union rights in practice and Violations in 2007
Background: Albania is one of the poorest countries in Europe, with high unemployment, widespread poverty and a serious problem of corruption.
40 000 children are working instead of attending school, mostly in connection to subcontracted shoes and clothing production (in 2006, textile, leather, garment and footwear production accounted for just over half of total Albanian exports).
Trade unions, particularly in the education sector, are working hard to combat child labour.
In June over two hundred chrome miners and their families protested on the steps of the Albanian parliament against the disastrous conditions in the sector, which claimed four workers' lives just over the first half of the year.
Trade union offices destroyed: Last year, this Survey told the story of two ITUC affiliates – BSPSH and KSSH – who were prevented from entering their headquarters.
This year, following a court decision on property restitution, the situation became even worse.
On the morning of 1 August, the police entered the trade union offices in the centre of Tirana and forcibly removed trade union property, destroying office equipment and documents in the process.
The intrusion took place without giving notice, and the staff of BSPSH and KSSH were not allowed to enter the building to salvage trade union possessions.
Trade unionists were trying to liaise with the government in order to find a quick solution for the continuation of their work, but they were not successful.
Anti-union business: According to the Independent Trade Union of Textile, Garment and Leather Workers, employers in the textile, garment, leather and footwear sector regard trade unions as enemies.
Companies have brandished the threat of relocation abroad if workers approach a union.
A few members of the independent light industry and textile trade union were dismissed because they provided the union with information on home work and child labour.
Slow justice: The Labour Code provided for special arbitration tribunals and labour courts to be established already in 2003, but it has not been done so far.
Trade unions report that challenging trade union rights violations in civil courts takes around three years due to the heavy workload of the courts.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Angola
Trade union activities are tolerated provided they do not "threaten" the country's reconstruction.
In practice, trade union activity is closely monitored by the authorities.
The legal framework is still unfavourable for trade unions.
The laws on trade unions, strikes and collective bargaining are lacking, but are under revision by the National Tripartite Commission.
Government approval is required to form a trade union, and the procedures are long and cumbersome.
Collective bargaining is banned in the civil service.
The categories of workers excluded from the right to strike exceed the ILO definition of essential services, and an excessively high quorum must be attained when holding a strike ballot.
Although discrimination against union members is prohibited, the law does not contain any effective measures to prohibit employer retribution against strikers.
The government can also requisition striking workers under various pretexts.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
2009 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Angola
Government approval required: The Constitution provides for the right to form and join trade unions, apart from the police and the armed forces.
However, government approval is required and the procedures are cumbersome.
At least 30% trade union membership is needed for setting up a branch union at provincial level, which is an excessive requirement.
Women and men engaged in domestic work or casual labour are excluded from the General Labour Act.
Strike restrictions: The right to strike is recognised, but strictly regulated.
The law does not contain any effective measures to prohibit employer retribution against strikers, and the government can force them back to work under various pretexts.
The law prohibits strikes by the armed forces, police, prison workers and fire fighters.
The Strike Act was being revised (as of February 2006) and trade unions called for genuine tripartite consultation to ensure it complies fully with international labour standards.
When holding a strike ballot the quorum to be attained (two-thirds of the votes) is too high.
The list of essential services is too long and includes, for instance, the transport sector, communications, waste management and treatment, and fuel distribution.
Collective bargaining is banned in the civil service.
Discrimination against union members is prohibited, but these rights are not consistently enforced.
The National Tripartite Commission has drafted some proposals for modifying the laws on trade unions, strikes and collective bargaining.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2008
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Australia
The 2009 Fair Work Act reinstated many of the rights removed by the previous Government.
At same time, there is concern at the prospect of another assault on workers' rights in newly-elected conservative State Government in Western Australia.
Harassment of trade union members and officials in the construction sector by the Australian Building and Construction Commission continued.
While the 2009 Fair Work Act improved the legislation concerning trade union rights, problematic areas remain.
Freedom of association is guaranteed for both private and public sector workers.
However, in order to register a union, an excessive 50 members is required, and in New South Wales, registration can be cancelled in case of a strike having a substantially adverse effect on public service.
Employers and other unions also have the right to challenge changes to union "eligibility rules", which essentially outline the types of employees unions can represent.
Furthermore, a tribunal can proceed to arbitrate disputes in a restricted number of cases where bargaining has come to a halt.
The right to strike is limited, as lawful strikes can only be called in connection with collective bargaining, but not when bargaining with multiple employers unless they form a single interest group (e.g.
a joint venture).
Also, protected industrial action can be terminated by the Minister at her/his own initiative, and the Fair Work Authority can suspend or terminate a strike if deemed to cause significant economic damage.
Strikes are also prohibited in a number of other instances, e.g.
if they obstruct government services.
Secondary action appears to be unlawful.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Background: Since the government did not have a majority in the Australian Senate, opposition parties were able to block key elements of labour law reform.
The newly-elected conservative State Government in Western Australia, which when previously in office had provided a test-bed for the anti-union laws of the former Federal Government, launched a review of industrial relations which it was feared would lead to another assault on workers' rights in that State.
Heavy restrictions on construction workers: Australian Building and Construction Commission (ABCC) inspectors continued to harass trade union members and officials in the construction sector during 2009, including conducting secret interrogations of individual workers without a guarantee of legal representation of their choice.
The ABCC has the power to impose fines of up to A$22,000 on workers and those who refuse to submit to the interrogation procedure can face prison terms of up to 6 months.
At the same time, employers were able to exploit deficiencies in the legislation which remained in place, including restrictions on collective bargaining insufficient protection from unfair dismissal for workers in small businesses during a 12-month probationary period, limitations on right of entry of trade union representatives to workplaces, and the retention of the notorious Australian Building and Construction Commission (ABCC).
2009 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Australia
Individual agreements: Prior to March 2008, the law promoted individual statutory agreements (Australian Workplace Agreements or AWAs) over collective agreements.
AWAs totally undermined the integrity of the collective bargaining process as they could be offered to employees as a condition of employment or when a collective agreement was in place.
Restrictions on bargaining subject matter: The WRA identifies a number of matters which are prohibited from being the subject of bargaining, to the extent that financial penalties apply to individuals or organisations which seek to include these matters in their agreements.
"Prohibited content" includes: leave to attend trade union meetings or training; right of entry for union officials; general representative rights for unions; restrictions on contractors; encouragement of trade union membership; remedies for unfair dismissal; restrictions on AWAs.
The right to strike: The law imposes significant restrictions on the right to strike:
Unfair dismissal: Employees of employers with fewer than 100 employees do not have unfair dismissal protection, meaning that around two thirds of private sector workers have no right to challenge an unfair dismissal.
Even in workplaces with 101 or more employees, a dismissal which is even partly for 'operational reasons' cannot be challenged for unfairness.
Building industry Act restricts union rights: The Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 imposes severe limitations on the right to strike, imposing a blanket prohibition on unprotected action (i.e.
strike action not specifically protected by the WR Act) and introduces the notion of "unlawful industrial action", accompanied by severe penalties and sanctions (of up to A$110,000 for bodies corporate and A$22,000 for individuals).
The Act also interferes in collective bargaining through a list of provisions that render project agreements (i.e.
those negotiated at a multi-employer level) unenforceable, and by restricting the issues that can be the subject of collective bargaining.
Furthermore, the Act gives considerable powers to the Australian Building and Construction Commission (ABCC) to investigate compliance with the law, including the power to enter premises and confiscate documents.
There are insufficient safeguards against interference in trade union activities.
The ILO's Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has requested that the Australian Government amend the Act.
Fair Work Bill 2008: In November 2008, the Australian Government introduced the Fair Work Bill into Parliament.
This Bill is intended to deliver on the Rudd Government's pre-election commitment to abolish Australia's unfair workplace laws.
The Bill provides a new industrial relations system for Australia.
The Bill recognises the right of workers to be represented by their union and to bargain collectively, imposes good faith bargaining obligations on employers, and restores unfair dismissal rights for most Australian workers.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2008
Australian unions continued their campaign to ensure that the new Government delivers on its promises to abolish Australia's unfair workplace laws and the ABCC, and to implement laws that recognise and protect the rights of workers and trade unions.
Workers on individual contracts worse off: Workers who were moved by employers onto individual contracts continue to lose out.
Many employers used AWAs to remove entitlements without adequate compensation and the median pay of non-managerial employees on AWAs is less than for those on collective agreements.
AWAs have impacted particularly harshly on women and those in casual or part time employment.
Employers sought to take advantage of the transitional arrangements to impose AWA-like conditions on their workforce for years to come.
Under the current law, employees on AWAs or ITEAs are not eligible to vote on collective agreements in their workplace.
This is despite the fact that these employees will move onto these agreements when their individual statutory arrangements expire.
At their iron ore operation in West Australia, BHP used this loophole to push through a non-union collective agreement which it concedes is "identical to existing AWAs.
" This agreement was voted on by 46 new employees with no consultation with the rest of the workforce.
The agreement will run for 5 years and will potentially apply to the remaining 12,000 employees when their AWAs expire.
In June 2008, Austral Shipping held a ballot of employees for a proposed non-union collective agreement.
The agreement was drafted by the company and circulated on a "take it or leave it" basis.
Only those employees whose AWAs had expired were eligible to vote and this represented a small percentage (an estimated 20%) of the workforce.
Existing employees who were still subject to AWAs were not entitled to vote, even though many of them could find themselves subject to the agreement in the future.
Freedom of association in construction industry restricted: The ABCC continues its campaign against workers and unions in the construction industry.
The ABCC has the power to fine workers for taking action to defend their wages and conditions and to gaol workers who take part in union meetings and refuse to cooperate with secret government interrogations.
More than 100 construction workers have been interrogated by the ABCC.
In 2008, Noel Washington, a Victorian branch senior vice president of the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU), was threatened with six months gaol for refusing to attend an ABCC examination.
The charges against Mr Washington were dropped just six days before he was scheduled to appear before the Federal Court.
Employers refuse to negotiate with unions: Some employers refused to bargain with unions, even where a majority of workers have expressed a preference for a union collective agreement.
Train drivers employed by Pilbara Iron Company, a rail services subsidiary of mining giant Rio Tinto, wanted the CFMEU to negotiate a new enterprise agreement following the expiry of their AWAs but the company has refused to negotiate with the union.
For months, employees at Maxitrans Australia in Ballarat sought to be represented by the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union in negotiations with the company.
The union had been issued with certification as a bargaining agent on behalf of its members, but the company has still refused to negotiate.
Instead, Maxitrans put a non-negotiated deal on the table which sought to strip away many employment conditions.
The main statutes which regulate termination of employment are the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act (IESA), 1946, and the Industrial Disputes Act (IDA), 1947, as amended.
Some States have also passed legislation dealing with dismissal.
Regulations concerning termination of employment are also found in standing orders made pursuant to the IESA.
Standing orders are written documents dealing with terms and conditions of employment.
Drafted by employers in all establishments, standing orders are documents on which trade unions or workers are given an opportunity to object.
They are certified by the government Certifying Officer who adjudicates upon the fairness and reasonableness of the provisions of any standing order and upon its conformity to the model standing order (MSO).
In 2002, the 2nd National Commission on Labour produced a report suggesting rationalisation and harmonisation of existing labour legislation, as well as creation of an “umbrella” legislation to ensure a minimum level of protection for the workers in the unorganised (informal) sector.
[1] In 2007, labour law reforms are still the subject of tripartite discussions in India.
The law relating to termination of employment in India distinguishes broadly between three different situations: dismissal for misconduct, discharge and retrenchment.
Indian law starts from the common law premise that an employer has a right to terminate the services of an employee without giving a reason.
[3] However, this position has been affected by legislative intervention and by the development by the courts of natural justice requirements.
As regards termination of employment for disciplinary reasons, some instances of misconduct which may justify dismissal without notice and any compensation in lieu of notice are listed in the MSO and include (secs.
14(2)-(3), MSO):
The IDA sets out detailed procedural requirements for retrenchment which is defined as the termination by the employer of employment of a worker for any reason, other than disciplinary, with certain exceptions (sec.
2 (oo), IDA) “Retrenchment” corresponds broadly to terminations based on economic grounds or related to the employee’s capacity (except retirements, dismissals for ill health and the expiry of fixed-term contracts).
Termination of employment is unlawful if it is for reasons related to trade union membership or activity; filing complaints concerning the employer; race, colour, sex, marital status, pregnancy, religion, political opinion or social origin.
In addition, termination of employment in violation of fair labour practices as defined by legislation or case law will not be valid.
The IDA (Fifth Schedule) lists some practices which will be considered to be “Unfair Labour Practices”.
These include dismissal on account of trade union activity or membership; dismissal by way of victimization; dismissal not in good faith but in “the colourable exercise of the employer’s rights”; dismissal by falsely implicating a worker in a criminal case or on false or trumped-up allegations of absence without leave, dismissal without due regard to natural justice or for minor misconduct leading to disproportionate punishment.
The list is not exhaustive.
Under the IESA, employers are required to give in writing one month’s notice or payment in lieu of such notice in order to lawfully terminate the employment of permanent monthly-paid workers.
The two weeks’ notice is required for workers paid on other basis.
Notice is not required either for probationers, badlis or temporary workers (sec.
13, MSO).
Furthermore, despite the fact that an employer is entitled to dismiss an employee for serious misconduct or inadequate performance of work, the rules of natural justice have now influenced labour law jurisprudence in India to the extent that the employer will be required to give the employee a “hearing” to answer the charges before the dismissal is effected.
This may take the form of a written complaint to initiate departmental proceedings with a view to disciplinary proceedings, and the hearing may be a mere explanation from the employee or may be a full departmental inquiry into the matter with the necessary documentary evidence.
Questions into the legality of dismissal due to misconduct often hinge on the nature of this internal inquiry and the Indian courts, in the interest of good industrial relations, have consistently affirmed the need for the usual rules of natural justice to apply.
Central to these rules are the requirements that the employee has a fair hearing, including the right to adduce evidence on his or her behalf and to cross-examine witnesses, and that the hearing be free from bias.
An employee who faces a charge of misconduct may also generally expect only a warning if it is a first offence or is not habitual conduct.
Where a matter relating to termination is pending before a conciliatory or adjudicatory body, the conditions applicable to the worker may not be altered (sec.
33, IDA).
However, a distinction is made for cessation of business for reasons beyond the control of the employer.
This might include force majeure, frustration of contract, etc., but does not include financial difficulties or loss of stock.
In such circumstances, the employee is still entitled to a redundancy payment, but the amount is less than that given for termination of employment due to other reasons, being a sum equivalent to no more than the average of three months’ pay (sec.
25FFF, IDA).
Since the 1965 amendments to the IDA (sec.
2A), the dismissal or retrenchment of an individual is deemed to be an industrial dispute, hence the ability of a worker to take his or her claim to the Labour Courts.
Under sec.
2(a) of the IESA, a worker dissatisfied with his or her termination of employment is entitled, in the first instance, to raise the matter as a labour dispute with an officer from the conciliation department of the Ministry of Labour.
The officer will attempt to conciliate the matter and must submit a report to the Government if conciliation fails, pending a decision from the governmental authority on whether the matter merits adjudication before the Labour Court or Tribunal.
Challenges to dismissal can be made to the Labour Court under sec.
11A of the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Disputes Act, 1971.
The Labour Court may review a termination of employment and set aside a dismissal if it decides that the dismissal was not justified.
No time limit is prescribed within which an aggrieved worker may raise a labour dispute.
However, excessive delay may prejudice a worker’s case.
The burden of proving that dismissal was for a valid reason rests with the employer.
The Labour Court, Industrial Tribunal and National Tribunal have wide discretion to review disputes relating to termination of employment, including the examination of the evidence, and to award relief as they see fit including compensation in the form of damages and reinstatement (sec.
11A, IDA).
Before reinstating an employee, the judicial body will inquire into the feasibility of reinstatement; for example, whether the employee has lost confidence in the employer and whether industrial peace and harmony will be threatened.

2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Bahamas
Layoffs in the hotel sector continued, and more trade union officials found themselves without a job.
The authorities have wide powers to interfere with trade union activities.
While basic trade union rights are guaranteed, they are subject to many excessive restrictions.
Private sector and most public sector workers have the right to form and join trade unions.
However, the authorities have genuinely discretionary powers to refuse to register a union, and to deny the required licence unions need to affiliate with any body outside Bahamas.
The authorities also interfere with internal trade union matters, as the Registrar must supervise the secret ballot to amend a union constitution.
The law stipulates that union representatives should be elected at intervals not exceeding three years.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
No progress on union organising: In recent years, there have been cases of the government or employers refusing to recognise trade unions as bargaining agents.
Dismissal, harassment and threats common anti-union practices: Harassment and threatening of trade union leaders are commonly used as a ploy for toppling the unions.
Government intervenes and ends strikes: The right to strike is not exercised freely, since the government sometimes intervenes to stop a strike and has a legal right to do so.
Lay-offs continued at resort: Eighty workers, including three union officials who acted as shop stewards, were laid off in September at the Sandals Royal Bahamian Resort.
The union was not given prior notice of the lay-offs.
A few weeks prior to the lay-offs, the employees at Sandals had voted in favour of union representation by the Bahamas Hotel Maintenance and Allied Workers Union (BHMAWU), which defeated the Bahamas Hotel Catering and Allied Workers Union.
The BHMAWU had been prevented from representing its members due to a long legal battle, but was recognised as the bargaining agent for the workers in a poll initially scheduled for 2008.
That same year, 150 employees including eight trade union executive members had been made redundant at the Sandals resort (See 2009 issue of the Survey).
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Bahrain
Freedom of association is limited, since Convention 87 has not been ratified, and the right to collective bargaining has not yet been recognised.
In 2009, workers at several construction companies were threatened with deportation or arrest during strikes and protests over poor working conditions.
Migrant workers, estimated at some 60% of the workforce, continue to face discrimination despite repeated criticism from the ILO.
Despite some initial guarantees, trade union rights are not adequately secured.
The Constitution recognises the right to form a union for lawful objectives and by peaceful means, provided that the fundamentals of the religion and public order are not infringed.
Only one trade union is allowed at each workplace, and all unions must belong to the General Federation of Bahrain Trade Unions.
A law that would have allowed more than one trade union per company was vetoed by the Shura council in February 2009.
Workers in the private sector are protected against anti-union dismissal, and the law provides for the possibility of reinstatement.
While foreign workers may join trade unions, they are not sufficiently protected in law.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Background: The government has not ratified Convention 87 on Freedom of Association, workers are discouraged from union activity, and union leaders are sacked and harassed.
The authorities released 178 political prisoners in April after an official pardon.
Those released included two prominent Shi'a opposition activists and the leader of an opposition organisation.
The economic crisis is also having an impact in Bahrain; in October, for example, the Manama Gulf Air trade unions alleged that the struggling Bahrain-owned carrier was planning to dismiss 272 workers.
A new draft Labour law is designed to cover some categories of workers previously excluded from the application of the Labour law with respect to certain aspects of labour relations, including weekly rest and compensation following unfair dismissal.
Domestic workers are reportedly to be covered by a forthcoming new labour law which will regulate the working hours and living conditions of domestic staff such as housemaids, drivers, childminders and cooks as well as potentially combating forced labour and trafficking.
According to reports, there are some five to 10 human trafficking cases every month, usually among domestic workers who have either been mistreated or forced into prostitution.
Strike at Iron Ore plant: refusal to negotiate: In October, workers and members of the trade union at the Gulf Industrial Investment Company's (GIIC) iron ore processing plant voted to go on strike after management allegedly made key decisions relating to staff rights and welfare without the union's consent.
The union was protesting against the fact that management refused to sign a "negotiation mechanism" requiring them to discuss issues relating to staff rights and welfare.
The company also scrapped the firm's transportation service (affecting 200 employees out of 300 employed at the company) and changed its Ramadan operating hours without the union being informed.
The union had submitted a draft of the negotiation mechanism to the senior management months before, demanding that any changes in terms and conditions of employment be subject to negotiation.
Union representatives are following up with the Labour Ministry.
Negotiation mechanisms refused by employers: In October 2009, over 400 Marine Port Union members began taking steps towards strike action.
Employees of the two companies managing the port were demanding, among other labour issues such as health insurance and shift allowance, that management come up with a negotiation mechanism on labour issues.
Union chairman Salman Al Saad alleged that the companies had refused all attempts by the union to negotiate employees' demands.
Since the union was established in 2007, they had not been able to find a negotiating mechanism.
The Labour Ministry presented a negotiation mechanism memorandum to be signed by the companies, but they have thus far refused.
One of the companies twice asked the union to sign its version of the mechanism memorandum which the General Federation of Bahrain Trade Unions (GFBTU) believed was against employees' rights and needs, and was therefore rejected.
2007 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Australia
Fears that the new industrial relations legislation would be used against workers and trade unionists soon proved true: 107 construction workers face individual prosecution and huge fines.
A union delegate was sacked for voicing concerns over health and safety issues and guest workers were dismissed for joining a union.
More workers have been forced out of collective agreements onto individual agreements, usually with less favourable conditions.
Individual agreements: The Work Choices legislation substantially strengthens the place of individual AWAs in the industrial relations system.
AWAs are no longer subject to collective agreements during the term of those agreements.
This means that an employer is free to offer to all employees, and to require new employees to sign, inferior AWAs even where there is a collective agreement in place binding the employer in respect of all employees.
This totally undermines the integrity of any collective bargaining process.
The incentives for employers to require AWAs have also been greatly increased.
AWAs now must include only five minimum conditions (minimum wage, annual leave, sick leave, unpaid parental leave and maximum weekly working hours) rather than being measured against comprehensive industrial awards, meaning that they can substantially undercut employees' previous wages and working conditions.
Once an AWA is made, awards cease to operate for that employee even after the expiry of the AWA.
Further, AWAs operate from the time lodged, rather than requiring scrutiny and approval from the EA or the IRC, as was previously the case.
Restrictions on bargaining subject matter: The Work Choices legislation increases the number of matters which are prohibited by law from being the subject of bargaining, to the extent that financial penalties apply to individuals or organisations which seek to include these matters in their agreements.
"Prohibited content" includes: leave to attend trade union meetings or training; right of entry for union officials; general representative rights for unions; restrictions on contractors; encouragement of trade union membership; remedies for unfair dismissal; restrictions on AWAs.
The right to strike: The Work Choices legislation imposes significant and new restrictions on the right to strike:
Unfair dismissal: The Work Choices legislation removed unfair dismissal protection for employees of employer with fewer than 100 employees, meaning that around two thirds of private sector workers lose their right to challenge an unfair dismissal.
Even in workplaces with 101 or more employees, a dismissal which is even partly for operational reasons cannot be challenged for unfairness.
Building industry Act restricts union rights: The 2005 Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill imposes even stronger limitations on the right to strike than the WRA, imposing a blanket prohibition on unprotected action (i.e.
strike action not specifically protected by the WRA) and introduces the notion of "unlawful industrial action", accompanied by severe penalties and sanctions (of up to A$110,000 for bodies corporate and A$22,000 for individuals).
The Act also interferes in collective bargaining through a list of provisions that render project agreements (i.e.
those negotiated at a multi-employer level) unenforceable, and by restricting the issues that can be the subject of collective bargaining.
Furthermore, the Act gives considerable powers to the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner (ABCC) to investigate compliance with the law, including the power to enter premises and confiscate documents.
There are insufficient safeguards against interference in trade union activities.
Western Australia – more rights than at federal level: In August 2002, the Western Australian Labour government enacted the Labour Relations Reform Act.
The Act repealed laws that permitted individual contracts to override collective agreements, reversed many of the discriminatory measures against trade unions contained in 1997 legislation, and removed requirements that unions undertake complicated pre-strike ballots.
Queensland – possible sanctions for protest action: In Queensland, the 1999 law on labour relations states that an organisation's registration can be cancelled if its members participate in protest action that prevents or disrupts economic or commercial activity or the provision of a public service.
AWAs used to undermine unions: Employers use the legislation on workplace agreements to undermine collective bargaining and promote individual agreements.
Trends show a move towards AWAs and away from union-negotiated collective agreements.
Impact of individual contracts: Workers who have been moved by employers onto individual contracts have usually lost out.
The government's own workplace agency revealed that two thirds of the new AWAs registered under the new laws removed penalty rates, one third cut overtime pay, a half removed shift allowances and another third scrapped public holiday payments, all leading to a fall in real wages.
Following public exposure of this information, the Employment Advocate has stopped collecting this data.
Call centre forces workers out of collective agreement: Global Tele Sales, a subsidiary of the German airline Lufthansa based in Melbourne, took advantage of the new industrial relations laws in June to force 80 workers to renounce a collective agreement signed with the Australian Services Union (ASU), not due to expire until December, and sign individual contracts.
Under the new contracts the workers faced pay cuts and penalties for taking sick leave or carer's leave, with no right to negotiate with the company over the terms of the contract.
The company claimed that employees were not being forced to sign the AWAs, yet it stated that it would not negotiate a new collective agreement, and that certain privileges would be withdrawn from those who refused to sign.
Staff reported that they felt they had no choice but to sign.
The Workplace Rights Advocate for the state of Victoria announced an investigation into the AWAs after the ASU expressed its concerns.
Construction workers prosecuted over industrial action: 107 construction workers from Western Australia face individual prosecutions brought by the government appointed and funded Australian Building and Construction Commission (ABCC).
Over 400 workers employed on the Perth to Mandurah railway link project had taken part in industrial action in February in protest at the unfair dismissal of their health and safety representative, Peter Ballard, from the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU).
Writs were issued against the workers on 5 July, months after the dispute between the workers and the employer had been settled.
It was the first time that fines had been issued against individual workers for taking strike action.
The prosecution was brought under the terms of Building and Construction Industry Improvement (BCII) Act 2005.
As a result of the court case, which began on 28 August, the workers face fines of up to AUD$ 28,600 each and possible jail sentences.
The Federal Court indicated that the hearing was unlikely to begin before October 2007.
Dismissed for union activities: The mobile crane company Botany Cranes sacked a CFMEU union delegate on 6 September, for "insubordination".
Barry Hemsworth had been a union delegate at the Sydney based company for ten years, and was a respected crane driver.
His dismissal came after he had expressed his concerns about health and safety issues at the company at a meeting on the subject, after being asked by his employer not to.
Unfair dismissal laws have been abolished in Australia, making it difficult for him to fight his dismissal.
Fellow employees condemned his sacking but under the new laws, they would face fines of up to AUD$20,000 each if they were to attend a meeting to discuss it.
2008 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Bahamas
Although the law recognises freedom of association, trade unions are sometimes not recognised.
Threats, intimidation and dismissals are the main strategies used against the unions.
Collective bargaining is deliberately delayed by employers with a view to obtaining the authorities' derecognising of a union in charge of bargaining.
Freedom of Association: Private sector and most public sector workers may form or join unions.
Members of the prison service, the police, the armed forces and the fire brigade are not covered by Labour Relations Act and therefore do not have the right to organise.
The Registrar has discretionary powers to reject a union's request for registration, which the ILO considers tantamount to prior authorisation and therefore against the principles of freedom of association.
The ILO has furthermore asked the government to alter to law to remove the stipulation that the Registrar or designated officer must supervise the secret ballot to elect or remove trade union officers or amend a union constitution.
Right to strike – strong limitations: The Industrial Relations Act requires a simple majority of a union's membership to vote in favour of a strike motion.
The Ministry of Labour must approve a strike ballot, which in the case of the public sector is contrary to the principles of freedom of association, given the government's role as employer.
Furthermore, section 75 of the Act restricts the objective of a strike and appears to prohibit protest and sympathy strikes.
If strikes are organised in violation of section 75, excessive sanctions, including imprisonment for up to two years are foreseen.
The government has the right to intervene in strikes to ensure the delivery of basic services and so uphold the "national interest".
Trade union rights in practice and Violations in 2007
No progress on union organising: 25 percent of the country's workforce are union members, but the right to join a union is only enjoyed by those sectors in which it is not explicitly banned.
Although those unions that are recognised basically manage to exercise their rights, in recent years there have been cases of the government or employers refusing to recognise trade unions.
Dismissal, harassment and threats are common anti-union practices: Dismissals for union activities do occur, however in some cases the workers have managed to obtain reinstatement following legal proceedings, since the law explicitly bans anti-union discrimination.
Harassment and threatening of trade union leaders are commonly used as a ploy for toppling the unions,
Government intervenes and ends strikes: The right to strike is not exercised freely, since the government sometimes intervenes to stop a strike and has a legal right to do so.
Taino Beach Resort sacks workers to weaken the union: In early October, 11 employees of the cleaning department at the Taino Beach Resort hotel were sacked.
They had been subcontracted by Bakan Cleaning Service Company Limited and were members of the Bahamas Hotel Catering and Allied Workers Union (BHCAWU).
That union had complained that the women workers had been threatened by hotel managers for several weeks to get them to leave the union.
The management claimed that the dismissals were due to a slump in the hotel's business.
However, the sackings came a few days after the Ministry of Labour recognised the BHCAWU as the collective bargaining agent for negotiating an agreement that would cover the cleaning department.
In early October the workers filed legal proceedings for reinstatement to their posts and obtained an agreement with the hotel and the sub-contracting firm that they would reinstate the workers and negotiate a collective agreement, however by the end of the year the agreement had not been honoured and the women had not got their jobs back.
Threats and restrictions on the work of a union leader at First Caribbean Bank: In August, members of the bank's management threatened Ms Theresa Mortimer, President of the Bahamas Financial Services Union, via a letter banning her from entering the bank to carry out union activities unless she had received prior authorisation to do so from the management; if she ignored the ban additional, stronger measures would be taken.
The bank's administration justified these restrictions on Ms Mortimer on the grounds that the union's work was against the policies of the bank.
The letter was received by Ms Mortimer as she was organising some protests and a strike by 300 of the bank's employees aimed at improving the unhealthy working conditions of the workers handling night deposits.
The union reported that this was not the first warning that Ms Mortimer had received.
At the end of the year the dispute was not over and Ms Mortimer was still facing the restrictions imposed by the bank.
2008 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Bahrain
Freedom of association recognised: The Workers' Trade Union Law of September 2002 introduced the right to belong to trade unions in Bahrain.
It established the General Federation of Bahrain Trade Unions (GFBTU) but not full freedom of association, as all trade unions have to belong to the GFBTU.
Workers in the private and public sector may join trade unions, including noncitizens, who make up the majority of Bahrain's workforce.
Only one trade union may be formed at each establishment, but no prior authorisation is required to form a union.
The only requirement is that the union's constitution must be communicated to the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, together with the names of the founding members.
Since October 2006, a decree on employment in the private sector prohibits dismissal for trade union activities.
Employers are also obliged to reinstate the sacked employees and to provide compensation if it is proved that they were discriminated against because of their union work.
Trade unions are not subject to administrative dissolution.
They may not engage in political activities.
Foreign workers harshly treated: Migrant workers make up roughly 60 per cent of the workforce.
Though in theory they are allowed to join unions and run for union office, etc., they prefer not to, as they have no protection against dismissal.
According to the proposed legislation, if expatriate workers overstay their work permits, they suffer heavy fines, are imprisoned for unspecified lengths of time and then deported.
Fear of deportation or employer retaliations prevented many foreign workers from complaining to the authorities.
Restrictions on the right to strike: Workers and employers must first seek an amicable settlement of the dispute through conciliation.
If this fails, a Committee of Conciliation and Arbitration refers the dispute to further conciliation and arbitration.
If the parties refuse the conciliation or if the conciliation fails, the dispute is settled though arbitration within a period not exceeding one week.
Trade union rights in practice and Violations in 2007
Government and employers increasingly clamp down on trade union action: The GFBTU, which had 55 affiliates, is actively involved in tripartite discussions, including on a new labour law, and unions can meet freely to discuss strategy, etc.
Employers are becoming increasingly impatient with trade union activity.
In November, the company sacked 50 of the workers, including five trade union branch leaders, who were on a month-long strike, for holding an illegal strike, after the union had unsuccessfully tried mediation through the Labour Courts.
The workers were reinstated after GFBTU intervention.
Trade union organisers fired: On July 18, two trade unionists at the Batelco company were fired after 450 workers took part in a protest march to demand a 25% pay rise and complain about the company replacing a voluntary early retirement plan with a compulsory employees' redeployment plan.
The Minister of Labour said the firings were unjustified and called on the company to reinstate the union organisers, but it had not done so by year's end.

2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Bangladesh
Even though Bangladesh lifted its two-year-old state of emergency in December of 2008, labour unrest and repression of trade unions continued during 2009.
Working conditions in the garment and ship-breaking industries remained appalling.
The global economic crisis hit garment workers especially hard.
In addition, unions still face difficulties when registering as well as when carrying out legitimate trade union activities.
Trade union rights are not adequately protected in law.
While the Constitution provides for freedom of association, in order to register, unions must represent an inordinate 30% of the workers in an enterprise and must obtain authorisation from the government.
No action can be taken prior to registration, and the Registrar may also cancel the registration with Labour Court approval.
In general, only enterprise unions can be created and only current employees can be union members, which means that the loss of a job also leads to the loss of union membership.
Public sector workers are prohibited from joining unions, although there are a number of notable exceptions.
Furthermore, the right to strike is also limited.
All strikes must be called within a specific time frame or the dispute will be considered terminated, and the decision to strike must be taken by a three-quarters majority.
The government can ban any strike that continues beyond 30 days in "essential services" or if the strike is considered a threat to national interest, in which case the 1974 Special Powers Act can be used to detain trade unionists without charge.
Offences such as "obstruction of transport" carry exorbitant penalties of up to 14 years' forced labour.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Background: With the lifting of the state of emergency, it was hoped that the situation for the Bangladesh trade union movement and that economic conditions for workers would improve.
However, Bangladesh workers faced the same problems that existed under the state of emergency.
Employers paid wages late, if paid at all, and numerous factories closed with no notice and without paying workers wages due.
The Bangladesh Factory Inspection Department released a survey on 29 June that revealed that 122 of the 825 factories surveyed, i.e.
almost 15%, did not pay their employees on time between January and May.
Another 53 did not pay overtime, and eight factories paid less than the government's minimum wage of 1662.50 taka (24 US dollars) per month.
Most workers only get 800 to 950 taka (13 to 15 US dollars) per month, the lowest wages for garment workers in the world.
The garment industry accounts for about 80% of Bangladesh's export trade and around 40% of its total industrial workforce.
Industry leaders say wages have been cut by 20 to 30% in recent months in a country where almost half the population is already living below the poverty line.
Child labour in ship-breaking sector: Bangladesh ship-breaking yards are reported to have profited from the use of child labour and unsafe working conditions.
A report released on 29 January, entitled "Childbreaking Yards: Child Labour in the Ship Recycling Industry in Bangladesh", stated that one quarter of the workers in the ship-recycling industry in Bangladesh are children: 10% of the workers are under 12 years old; 15-20% are under the age of 15; and 25% are younger than 18 years old.
On 22 October, the Bangladesh Metalworkers' League (BML) and the IMF called for an end to barbaric deaths in the ship-breaking yards in Bangladesh after seven workers died in one week.
Unionists charged for demonstrating: On 6 July, the High Court directed 14 labour leaders and workers to surrender before the trial court within eight weeks in connection with a case filed against them following recent demonstrations at the garment factories in Ashulia.
Industries Minister Dilip Barua said that a certain group had created the labour unrest in garment factories in Ashulia to destabilise the country.
Those charged include the Bangladesh Garment Sramik Trade Union Kendra (Bangladesh Garment Workers' Trade Union Centre – GWTUC) adviser and advocate Mantu Kumar Ghosh, its president Idris Ali, its general secretary KM Ruhul Amin, and its office secretary Joly Talukder.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Barbados
The industrial relations system is characterised by a high degree of voluntarism, which has allowed the employers to refuse to recognise or negotiate with trade unions at times.
The law fails to recognise the right to collective bargaining.
Despite some initial guarantees, trade union rights are not sufficiently secured in law.
While the law secures the right to form unions except for members of the armed forces, employers have no legal obligation to recognise unions.
Anti-union activities are not prohibited, and although workers who are wrongfully dismissed can apply to the courts, this right is very limited since judges generally award compensation instead of reinstatement.
Furthermore, despite having ratified ILO Convention 98, the right to collective bargaining is not explicitly recognised.
Since 1993, a set of protocols has provided for increases in wages, and the fifth Prices and Incomes Protocol was signed by government, the private sector and union representatives in 2005.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Right to organise is still weak: As they are not obliged to do so by law, employers sometimes refuse to recognise trade unions.
Government neither supports nor guarantees collective bargaining: Since there are no legal requirements, collective bargaining is only practised on a voluntary basis or based on tradition.
Generally the bargaining is restricted to four areas: minimum wages, working hours and standards, recruitment procedures and disciplinary and grievance procedures.
Often, despite recognising unions, employers refuse to negotiate a collective agreement.
Evading union procedures: A series of events at LIME, formerly known as Cable and Wireless, marked 2009.
Early in the year, workers at the LIME Barbados contact centre found themselves locked out from their workplace as the company announced the discontinuation of the centre.
The company then issued termination letters to approximately 100 of its workers without engaging in any prior discussions with the Barbados Workers Union (BWU), thus failing to comply with the proper procedures for lay-offs and breaching the collective agreement with the BWU.
Following local and international union pressure, as well as involvement from the government, LIME withdrew the dismissals temporarily and agreed to abide by the procedures.
Already in 2008, the company threatened to lock out the workers after talks over wages and working conditions broke down, and also announced lay-off plans without properly consulting with the BWU.
2008 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Bangladesh
Proclamation of State of Emergency – all trade union activities banned: While severely restricting "trade union activities", the State of Emergency did not impose similar restrictions of any kind on employers or their federations.
The military-backed caretaker government also passed the Emergency Powers Ordinance 2007 (EPO), supplemented by Emergency Power Rules 2007 (EPR), to implement the State of Emergency.
The EPO explicitly states that no order under the ordinance can be challenged in the courts.
These powers have effectively granted security forces the ability to disregard arrest warrants and provides them with the right to conduct arbitrary arrests and detention.
Section 3 of the EPR explicitly forbids any forms of assembly, demonstration or rallies without prior permission from the authorities, with punishment set at two to five years' imprisonment for violators.
Another part of the EPR authorizes the use of force to execute any order made under the EPO.
Human rights organizations estimate that approximately 200,000 persons were arrested by the authorities for varying periods between January and August.
Sweeping restrictions also applied to the media, with strict prohibitions on publishing anything that the government considers "provocative" – which in practice has meant any report critical of the security forces or their actions.
New Labour Law still contains many restrictions: The Bangladesh Labour Act of 2006 (BLA) is considered a step forward for clarity because it effectively consolidated laws from 25 separate acts into one comprehensive law.
However, during the year, the operation of the State of Emergency, EPO and EPR effectively prevented the implementation of many of the provisions of the BLA.
Many of the previous restrictions on trade union rights existing in previous laws were carried over into the BLA.
Unions must have government approval to be registered, and no trade union action can be taken prior to registration.
Unions can only be formed at the factory/establishment level, with some exceptions (such as private road transport, private inland river transport, tea, jute bailing, bidi production) where union formation can take place based on geographic area.
There can be no more than three registered trade unions in any establishment.
Candidates for union office have to be current or former employees of an establishment or group of establishments.
The Registrar of Trade Unions has wide powers to interfere in internal union affairs and may also cancel the registration of a union with Labour Court approval.
Exclusions from union membership: Under the BLA, workers in government or employed in offices under government authority are prohibited from belonging to a trade union with the exception of railway, postal, telecommunications, public works, public health engineering and government printing press workers.
Members of local government units, fire fighters and the security forces are also denied the right to form unions.
Managerial staff and employees who are designated by employers as "confidential" are prevented from joining unions.
Right to strike hardly recognised: Three quarters of a union's members must agree to a strike before it can go ahead.
The government can ban any strike if it continues beyond 30 days (in which case it is referred to the Labour Court for adjudication), if it involves a public service covered by the Essential Services Ordinance or if it is considered a threat to the national interest.
In this last case, the 1974 Special Powers Act can be used to detain trade unionists without charge.
The government may ban strikes for renewable periods of three months.
Sentences of up to 14 years' forced labour can be passed for offences such as "obstruction of transport".
Compulsory conciliation and court referral procedures: The labour law requires that parties to an industrial dispute must follow legal procedures (such as request conciliation, serve notice of a strike or lock-out, or refer the dispute to the Labour Court for settlement) within a specified period or the authorities will consider the labour dispute to be terminated.
Section 212 of the BLA prohibits for a period of one year the raising of the specific issue or subject of such an industrial dispute after a termination order of this type is issued.
EPZ Law – significant restrictions continue: EPZs are considered outside the purview of the BLA.
The EPZ Workers Association and Industrial Relations Act (2004) provides for the formation of trade unions in EPZs from 1 November 2006.
However, the law sets out several phases for implementation, with complicated and cumbersome procedures to be followed at each stage.
At stage one, EPZ factory workers were only allowed to set up Worker Representation and Welfare Committees (WRWC).
The law required all enterprises in the EPZ to have one WRWC, whose elected representatives have the power to negotiate and sign collective agreements on a limited set of topics but not to strike or organise demonstrations.
However, during 2006 and early 2007, workers reported that employers generally refused to bargain with WRWCs.
Stage one ended on October 31, 2006, but continued in practice into 2007 because of systematic delays of the government to set out and implement the administrative procedures to transition worker organizations to stage two of the law.
At the second stage of the law, workers were allowed to go through a process to transform their WRWC into a trade union, referred to as a Workers Association (WA) in the law.
A WA can be created provided over 30 per cent of the workforce requests that the association should be set up.
More than 50 per cent of all the workers in the factory must vote affirmatively for the WA to be formed.
Only one federation of WAs can be formed per EPZ, if at least 50 per cent of the registered WA in the zone vote for it.
EPZ Labour tribunals still not formed: Although the EPZ law provides for the establishment of an EPZ Labour Tribunal and an EPZ Labour Appellate Tribunal, a full four years after the passage of the EPZ law, these two tribunals have yet to be established.
As a result, workers in the EPZs were effectively denied access to the judicial system for their grievances.
Trade union rights in practice and Violations in 2007
Systematic refusal of authorities to register new unions: The Joint Director for Labour (JDL) who is responsible for registering new trade unions refused to take any actions during the year on pending union registration applications, thereby effectively denying workers their right to associate and bargain collectively with their employer.
The Ashik Dress Design Workers Union, MN Sweater Workers Union, Lufa Garment Workers Union, Max Ambo Workers Union, and Dekko Accessories Workers Union submitted their applications between September and November 2006, and in the case of Lufa, Max Ambo, and Dekko, submitted them again (with changes requested by the JDL) in January 2007, but by the end of the year they had received no indication about when their applications will be approved.
Threats to de-register trade unions for making international appeals: The JDL filed a case on March 21 with the Labour Court, seeking to de-register the Bangladesh Garments and Industrial Sramik Federation (BGIWF), the trade union wing of BCWS.
Export processing zones – union busting by employers aided and abetted by the authorities: Employers in the EPZs have been consistently hostile towards trade unions, claiming that many of the companies would be ruined if they had to have unions.
While the EPZ law required all factories to have a WRWC, significant anti-union discrimination, including harassment, intimidation and dismissals, were directed at workers leading the WRWCs.
According to international labour rights advocates, more than 50 WRWC leaders were terminated, and despite appeals by labour law advocates, the BEPZA chair declined to exercise his power under the law to reinstate these leaders.
However, following the filing of the AFL-CIO GSP petition against Bangladesh in June, and the USTR hearing in October during which the petition was accepted for further consideration (over the objections of the government and employer federations), international pressure began to have a significant impact.
Delaying tactics at BEPZA relented and workers were provided the opportunity to register their intent to form WAs and participate in elections to formally establish them.
In the final months of the year, many WAs went through the election process, frequently with over 90% of the workers in favour of the WA.
However, at the end of the year, employers were still refusing to substantively accept the role of WAs or to enter into collective bargaining negotiations with them.
Despite numerous demands made by newly established WAs in the final months of the year, there was no report of any collective agreement with a WA.
Employers take advantage of legal loopholes: Workers who try to create a trade union are not protected before registration and are often persecuted by their employers.
The names of workers who apply for union registration are frequently passed on to employers who promptly transfer or dismiss them.
Even after registration, workers suspected of carrying out trade union activities are regularly harassed and threatened.
A common tactic of employers is to dismiss a worker for misconduct, thereby making them ineligible to remain a trade union officer.
While a worker can complain to the Labour Court, they face problems of underlying corruption at the courts and serious backlog of cases which, in some instances, can stretch back many years.
Military and security forces interference and intimidation: In both the EPZs as well as factories outside the zones, employers regularly collude with police and military forces to intimidate and force worker leaders to resign from the union.
Trade union leaders have been beaten by authorities and kept in overnight detention.
Workers at Aysha Fashions faced employer and police repression after an incident in the factory where a line manager beat an employee on March 19.
When workers protested, management responded by bringing in 20 police who harassed the workers and conducted searches in the workers' residential areas.
The next morning, 30 police were present at the factory as workers arrived, and three workers who led the previous day's protest were arrested.
On March 21, the most senior workers were compelled by management to sign blank papers in the presence of police and were fired.
On March 29, police from the Ashulia police station raided the local Worker Education Center and detained Aysha workers.
Additionally, management in the RMG industry routinely, and with the collusion of government authorities, files complaints against workers in criminal court rather than in labour courts, (the latter being the proper forum for such complaints).
The expenses associated with criminal cases are beyond the means of most workers to contest, making it exceedingly difficult to defend themselves.
Moreover, the cases often drag on indefinitely, carry heavier sentences than labour court cases, and serve to intimidate workers so that they will refrain from promoting trade unions, or, in the case of the EPZs, WRWC or Workers Association.
Firings, intimidation, and use of thugs – favourite employer tactics to stop unions in the garment sector: All over Bangladesh, union leaders and members were routinely harassed, verbally and physically threatened, beaten, suspended, and fired for pursuing union activities.
Most employers operated with total impunity and without regard for legal protections for trade union rights.
The authorities seemed particularly concerned about work being done nationally and internationally to assist EPZ workers and about collaboration with local trade union partners to insist that the government enforce its labour laws.
Arrest and detention of general secretary of Dhaka University Teachers Association (DUTA): Following unrest on the Dhaka University campus which was violently suppressed by police and army personnel, a number of academics made public statements decrying the use of violence.
In response, the authorities detained Professor Anwar Hossain, the general secretary of the DUTA, and four other senior professors on unsubstantiated charges of fomenting unrest against the Government.
Dr. Hossain was taken in the middle of the night of August 24 from his residence by heavily armed men dressed in civilian clothes who claimed to be army personnel.
He was detained at Dhaka Central Jail, and he and his colleagues were charged with violating the EPR.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Belarus
After a brief period of renewed dialogue between the authorities and the BKDP, the situation has again deteriorated.
Trade union members are routinely harassed, blackmailed and even arrested.
Three people lost their jobs in connection with trade union activities, but one of them was reinstated by an unprecedented court ruling in a trade union discrimination case.
Unions submitted an international complaint about the government's attempts to weaken the right to strike.
Restrictive labour laws hamper trade union activities.
Trade unions operate in a harsh legal environment.
The 1996 Constitution transferred all powers to the President, giving him the right to enact decrees that carry the weight of law.
While the Constitution technically recognises freedom of association, union registration is extremely difficult.
The minimum membership requirement is prohibitively high, and a letter from the employer confirming the address of the union is often needed.
Trade unions can be deleted from the register by a decision of the registrar, without any court procedure, if the organisation is held to violate legislation or its own statutes, or if the union's recorded data is no longer correct.
Foreign assistance may not be offered without the consent of the authorities.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Background: With the adoption of the European Union Eastern Partnership, relations might receive a new dimension, however the restrictions against Belarusian high officials were not lifted as the country failed to make progress with respect to free elections, freedom of expression and freedom of association.
In December, President Lukashenko confirmed that his government was planning to tighten control of the Internet.
The independent trade union movement consolidated when the Radio-Electronic Workers Union joined the Congress of Democratic Trade Unions.
Lay-offs were rare, but many workers were forced to take a leave of absence or to go part-time.
Wage arrears were not uncommon.
Extensive right to draft fixed-term contracts: The entry into force of Presidential Decree No.
29 of 1999 has given the employers the right to conclude short-term contracts (1 year) with all workers.
The conclusion of these contracts is completely at the employers' discretion, and workers previously employed on indefinite contracts can be dismissed if they refuse to accept the new ones.
The short-term contracts, which have quickly become omnipresent, were introduced to "discipline" and essentially blackmail workers, and used to get rid of activists and undermine independent trade unions.
When companies have to downsize, workers' contracts are simply not renewed without any severance pay.
However, courts have recently accepted that the use of short-term contracts can be restricted by means of collective bargaining: on 24 September a trade union member was re-instated by a court order, since, according to the applicable collective agreement, the employer was obliged to renew the contracts of "hard workers who did not breach discipline".
Anti-union policies bring the loss of EU trade benefits: On 20 December 2006, the European Union's Council of Ministers announced its decision to withdraw Belarus' benefits under the system of generalised special preferences (GSP).
The decision was the culmination of nearly three years of monitoring violations of trade union rights and the government's reluctance to follow the Commission of Inquiry recommendations.
The EU decision came into effect on 21 June 2007, following the government's failure to achieve tangible progress in implementing the Commission of Inquiry Recommendations.
The EU stressed that once Belarus has shown that it respects basic trade union rights, the decision on GSP can be reversed.
The European Commission confirmed the EU position could only change once the ILO conventions were fully implemented, and that the EU followed the ILO appraisal of the situation.
Earlier, in June, the International Labour Conference had concluded that, while the measures already taken were duly appreciated, the Government was to "redouble its efforts", and that substantive improvements were yet to be achieved.
The Congress of Democratic Trade Unions (BKDP) has since called on the Government to concentrate on substantive reforms instead of lobbying to bring the EU trade preferences back.
Improvements followed by renewed anti-union pressure: On 20 February, the tripartite National Council on Labour and Social Issues endorsed the government's Action Plan for the implementation of the ILO Commission of Inquiry recommendations, and in April and May the Council for the Improvement of Legislation in the Social and Labour Sphere tried to find ways to move forward on issues such as the denial of trade union registration and anti-union dismissals.
By the end of the first half of the year, independent trade unions were cautiously optimistic of the chances for renewed respect for trade union rights in the country.
The Government's actions were, however, obstructed by the "traditional" Federation of Trade Unions of Belarus (FPB), an organisation with close ties to the authorities that could lose its domineering position if the standards on freedom of association were to be implemented properly.
During the year, FPB lobbied for special privileges for "most representative" trade unions, disseminated instructions on company-level collective bargaining that would get smaller trade unions side-lined, and "forgot" to extend an invitation to the tripartite National Council to other trade unions.
Furthermore, the pressure against the independent (non-FPB) trade unions was renewed in July, and some of the earlier positive steps were reversed: on 23 October, President Lukashenko signed Ordinance No.
518, which disbanded the commission that returned deductions on the rent for trade union offices and meeting rooms to all trade unions, whilst extending the reduced rent only to the FPB and its organisations.
Anti-union harassment was also reported in different companies and regions.
On 3 September, the Congress of Democratic Trade Unions (BKDP) adopted a declaration asking the government to take urgent measures against recent anti-union campaigns, and announced its intention to leave the National Council on Labour and Social Issues if the government continued the policy of paying lip service to the ILO while suppressing independent trade unions.
Registrations denied: Despite the dissolution of the Republican Registration Commission, independent trade unions still face enormous legal and practical hurdles during the registration process.
On 26 April, the Radio-Electronics Workers' Union (REWU) noted that three of its organisations had been denied registration since the beginning of the year, and that permission to organise pickets to demand registration had been denied on 15 occasions.
The Government maintained that it can refuse to register REWU organisations if they include workers not from the radio-electronic industry.
Union busting at Brest State University: In August, members of the Free Trade Union (SPB) at A.S. Pushkin Brest State University, were called back to work from their annual holidays and forced to choose either to leave SPB or incur problems with their dissertations and risk not having their employment contracts renewed.
"Either you resign from SPB and we work together, or you do not resign and we do not work together" was the rector's words to Oleg Golenko, a member of the SPB committee and a music instructor at the faculty of psychology and education science.
Five trade unionists gave in to the employer, but Golenko, whose contract would expire in July, resigned from his job instead, in protest against blackmailing.
In the meantime the local government asked the head of SPB at the university to submit all documents on trade union activities (statutes, membership fees, financial planning, and minutes of meetings) in two days' time.
The trade union had already been inspected by the tax authorities in 2008, when no irregularities were found.
The university has been trying to get rid of SPB since 2005.
Trade union event almost thwarted: On 27 August, five Dutch activists representing the trade union confederation FNV (Netherlands) and fifteen Belarusian colleagues representing youth committees of the Congress of Democratic Trade Unions (BKDP) arrived at a resort facility outside of Minsk, where a conference hall was booked for a session of the International Summer School for young trade unionists.
However, the next morning, management refused to honour the booking of the conference hall.
When BKDP deputy-president called on the director's office to clarify the situation, he found the director teary-eyed in the company of a man who appeared to be a plain-clothed intelligence officer.
Trade unionists decided to go ahead with the event outdoors.
Independent trade unions sidelined: Two chemical companies – Naftan and Grodno Azot – obstructed the work of the local organisations of the Independent Trade Union (BNP) by denying BNP recognition and the right to bargain collectively.
Grodno Azot claimed that BNP had to "prove its existence as a legitimate organisation", while Naftan OAO harassed BNP members: a worker who joined BNP on 6 October was intimidated and blackmailed by the floor manager, and forced to resign on 3 November.
Court reverses anti-union dismissal: On 18 December, the Chashniki district court in Vitebsk Oblast reinstated Alexey Gabriel, leader of the Free Trade Union SPB at the Lukoml Hydroelectric plant.
The court ordered the employer to renew Gabriel's contract for the duration of his term as a trade union officer.
Gabriel's employment contract was due to expire on 30 September, and in August the company director told him that his contract would not be renewed due to his "vigorous trade union activities".
During the hearings the employer denied that Gabriel's activities had played a role in him losing his job, but the unionist, supported by the Congress of Democratic Trade Unions (BKDP), was able to prove his case.
For the first time, a worker was able to convince the court to overturn anti-union discrimination.
Unionist under surveillance: The president of the Congress of Democratic Trade Unions (BKDP) Aliaksandr Yarashuk is often thoroughly searched by the customs and border control on his way out of the country and back.
The latest incident took place on 21 December when Yarashuk was returning from Ukraine.
Chancellor Alistair Darling and his deputy Liam Byrne, the chief secretary, stole an audacious political march on the Tories by announcing a one-year pay freeze for the most senior civil servants, members of the judiciary, senior NHS managers, GPs and chief executives of quangos.
The freeze in effect represents a pay cut.
And by targeting the richest public-sector figures, it will be seen as a sign that the broadest shoulders must carry the heaviest burden.
More junior groups covering more than 700,000 other public-sector workers fare little better, with proposed rises of between 0 and 1%.
This small rise, lower than that expected in the private sector next year, will cover prison officers, hospital doctors and dentists , contract dentists, and civil service groups not tied in to multi-year deals.
The recommendation will be put to the independent pay review bodies in the next few weeks.
"We were due to submit details of our pay claim to the senior salary review body on 17 November along with the head of the civil service, Sir Gus O'Donnell.
A lot of civil servants will be angry that a multi-year deal has been broken like this.
"
Byrne insisted: "If we want to halve the deficit over four years and protect frontline services, we have to make tough but realistic decisions on pay.
That means leadership from senior groups.
"
The head of the Audit Commission, Steve Bundred, has already called for a pay freeze on all six million public-sector workers.
It is that which has got to tackled together with bringing their bloated pensions and early retirement rights if we are ever going to get the nations finances back together!
The private sector has effectively been operating a pay freeze for some time now - and why not when there is no inflation?
What is typical is that Labour can't bring themselves to deal with this issue with their client state ... clearly there should be a pay freeze across the public sector not simply those people who won't vote labour anyway!
It's the bloated, serried rows of crap behind them I object to.
It's about time for a pay freeze, especially in a low inflation economic phase.
With savage pay-cuts and redundancies across the UK economy, and with the worst economic conditions since WWII, do they seriously expect to get a pay rise!!

2008 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Belarus
The unacceptable trade union rights situation caused Belarus to lose the European Union trade preferences, a dubious honour shared with only one other country in the world.
While the government has taken some steps in the right direction, anti-union legislation and practice remains firmly in place.
The headquarters of the Belarusian Congress of Democratic Trade Unions has been searched by police, at least one trade unionist was arrested and one fined during the year.
The Ministry of Justice feels obliged to inspect trade union activities, and management in state enterprises has been forcing workers out of independent trade unions.
The 1996 Constitution transferred all powers to the president of Belarus, giving him the right to enact decrees that carry the weight of law.
This constitution technically recognises the right of workers to form and join trade unions, but both the Trade Union Law of January 2000 and several presidential decrees contain serious violations of trade union rights.
At the beginning of 2004, Belarus was subject to the ILO Commission of Inquiry procedure, the strongest of its enforcement mechanisms.
The Commission's report, published in October 2004, proved, beyond doubt, that trade union rights were blatantly violated in Belarus.
The Commission adopted 12 recommendations aimed at bringing national law and practice into line with international standards.
While the government has taken some steps to implement these recommendations, no tangible progress has been achieved so far.
Some laws and by-laws adopted after the Commission of Inquiry ended its work brought up further restrictions on trade union freedoms.
Trade union registration: Trade union registration is compulsory.
Presidential Decree no.
2 of January 1999 required all previously registered trade unions at the national, industry and enterprise level to reregister.
If a trade union is not registered, its activities are banned and the organisation has to be dissolved.
The long and complicated procedures include an obligation on the trade unions to provide the official address of their headquarters.
This is often their workplace or the premises of the enterprise.
A letter from the management confirming the address is usually required, making trade unions completely dependent on the good will of the employer.
Trade unions are not allowed to register the home addresses of their leaders as the trade union's legal address, and commercial rent is often not an option, especially for small organisations.
The 2004 ILO Commission of Inquiry concluded that Decree No.
2 should be amended to eliminate the obstacles for registration and that trade union organisations must be registered regardless of whether they are able to provide a legal address.
The Republican Registration Commission, a mysterious state body for the approval of trade union registration that included security services representatives, was disbanded by a Presidential Decree of 9 October 2006, at the ILO's insistence.
Compulsory dissolutions: In 2005 a number of amendments to laws and regulations were introduced to make trade unions' compulsory dissolution even easier.
Trade unions' organisational structures, in other words, their primary and territorial organisations, may be deleted from the register by a decision of the registrar, without any court procedure.
This can happen if the registrar issues a written warning that a trade union or its structure violated legislation or its own statutes, and the violations had not been eliminated within a month.
Given that Belarusian legislation is incompatible with the ILO standards, this amendment allows for the administrative dissolution of trade unions that simply want to exercise their freedoms according to international standards.
The registrar can also remove a trade union organisation from the register if their recorded data is no longer correct – for example, if they lose their legal address and cannot obtain a new one.
A trade union can also be dissolved by a court decision for some violations of the law on mass activities or if it violates the provisions on receiving foreign financial aid.
International cooperation restricted: A number of decrees and ordinances, which are the legal acts promulgated by President Lukashenko, lay down stringent conditions for the receipt of foreign assistance for activities in the country.
These decrees, applicable to trade unions and other civil society organisations, have been seen as an attempt to isolate independent trade unions from their partner organisations abroad, as well as limit the capacity of the unions to protest against continued violations of workers' rights.
According to Presidential Decrees No.
8 of 2001 and No.
24 of 2003, foreign funds must be registered with the Human Resource Department, which is directly under the responsibility of the president.
No foreign assistance may be offered to nongovernmental organisations, including trade unions, to hold seminars, meetings, gatherings, strikes, pickets or so on or to carry out "propaganda" against members of organisations.
In August 2005, President Lukashenko issued Ordinance No.
460, amending the former Ordinance No.
460 of 2003 "On international technical assistance provided to the Republic of Belarus".
This ordinance introduced more red tape to the international activities of civil society, including trade unions.
The organisers have to report on the organising and running of the events to the government's Commission for International Technical Cooperation.
These events also have to be registered at the Ministry of Finance; otherwise, they would be considered illegal.
Heavy limitations on the right to strike: The January 2000 Labour Code imposes severe limitations on the right to strike.
It sets out very complicated conciliation procedures that would take at least two months.
The strike must also be held in the three months following the failure of the conciliation procedures.
The president may suspend a strike for a period of up to three months or even cancel one, in the interests of national security, public order, public health, or when the rights and freedoms of others are threatened.
Moreover, the duration of the strike must be specified in advance and a minimum service must be ensured.
Strike participants may not receive financial aid or subsidies from foreign organisations.
Draft Trade Union Law: The 2004 ILO Commission of Inquiry ruled that anti-union legislation, including the above-mentioned decrees, should be repealed.
The government's approach was not to take measures pertaining to these individual pieces of legislation, but to promise that the new trade union law will resolve all problems.
In 2006, President Lukashenko approved a "Concept" of the new Law on Trade Unions, which was prepared without consulting the trade unions outside the FPB structures.
The presidential press service then said that the new law would qualify trade unions as "one of the most powerful supports of the state".
Indeed, even at its conceptual stage, the new law introduced further complications to the forming and functioning of truly independent trade unions.
When the first draft of the law saw the light of the day in May 2007, the ITUC-affiliated Belarusian Congress of Democratic Trade Unions (BKDP) dubbed it "the law on state control over trade unions", since the draft gives authorities wide-range powers to inspect trade union documentation and activities.
The government planned to keep the excessive minimum membership requirements and introduce quite a rigid framework for trade union activities.
The registration procedure would remain long and cumbersome, with a number of loopholes allowing authorities to grant or deny registration at their discretion.
The draft introduces a distinction between representative and other trade unions, granting extensive privileges to the former well above what would be acceptable by ILO standards.
While such a distinction exists in a number of countries, trade union independence in Belarus had been seriously compromised, and legalising favouritism of existing bigger trade unions would ensure a de-facto trade union monopoly in Belarus.
The consultation on the draft law on trade unions and its subsequent withdrawal represents a success from the trade union perspective.
Trade union rights in practice and Violations in 2007
Government control: The aim of President Lukashenko appears to be a return to the Soviet days when trade unions were the "social pillars" of the state, under the control of the party or, rather, the so called "Presidential Administration", which now exercises the authority previously vested in the party.
The government spares no means in suppressing protests and opposition by unions to the daily violations of trade union and human rights in Belarus.
Not only does the government try to isolate these trade unions at the national level, but it also criminalises support at the international level.
The leaders of independent unions, notably the leader of the BKDP Alexander Yaroshuk, are exposed to pressure in the media, which is largely government controlled.
Workers are actively discouraged from joining independent trade unions.
An estimated 90 per cent of workers are employed on fixed-term contracts with many of the contracts being short-term.
In practice, this system is used to force workers out of independent trade unions.
The government's response to criticism is that the law provides all necessary remedies and that the victims can always turn to courts.
However, the ILO supervisory bodies have noted on several occasions that the Belarusian judiciary, in its present state, did not constitute an adequate recourse to redress trade union rights violations, and that complaints for violations of trade union rights were either totally ignored or routinely dismissed by prosecutors' offices.
Anti-union policies bring the loss of EU trade benefits: On 20 December 2006, the European Union's Council of Ministers announced its decision to withdraw Belarus' benefits under the system of generalised special preferences (GSP).
This decision was the culmination of nearly three years of monitoring violations of trade union rights and the government's reluctance to follow the Commission of Inquiry recommendations.
The EU has the right to impose such a sanction against states that violate core labour standards; however, it is perceived as a last resort, with Burma being the only other country to have its GSP benefits withdrawn.
While this decision gave Belarus six more months to fulfil its ILO obligations, no tangible progress could be noted, and the EU decision came into effect on 21 June; this decision is estimated to have affected approximately 400 million euros worth of Belarusian exports.
Authorities react to the EU decision: trade unions forced to beg, lie and manipulate: With the date of GSP benefits withdrawal approaching, the government strengthened its lobbying strategies as a last-ditch effort to avoid consequences of its failure to address violations of trade union rights.
Aside from trying to hoodwink the ILO and the EU with measures that both ITUC and BKDP saw as clearly insufficient, some awkward tactics have been employed, using trade unions both in Belarus and abroad.
The pro-government Federation of Trade Unions of Belarus (FPB) has been mobilised in an attempt to misinform the international community via administratively orchestrated public protests and appeals.
Different organisations within the FPB structures were requested to send petitions to the ILO and the European Commission, in which these organisations would deny the violations of trade union rights.
For example, in May the Belarusian Independent Trade Union's (BNP) organisation at the "Polimir" company was asked to join a declaration prepared by FPB, which requested the EU to go back on its decision.
After trade union leader Ivan Svyatokho refused to sign the FPB letter, the company management threatened not to re-engage employees on fixed-term contracts and also threatened other intimidating consequences.
The shop supervisors pushed the BNP members to sign a letter to the ILO and EU, which said that all internationally known allegations of trade union rights violations in Belarus had been far-fetched and that no pressure on trade unions had ever been imposed.
Social dialogue: On 31 January BKDP finally re-gained its official seat in the National Council for Labour and Social Issues (NCLSI).
However, according to BKDP, NCLSI is not a truly independent body, and none of the issues suggested by BKDP had been put on the agenda during the year.
The government has created a parallel body, the Council for Improvement of Legislation in Labour and Social Sphere, supposedly as a mediation body for trade union rights violations, but its decisions are not binding and so far have not brought any positive outcome.
Trade union registration: Despite the dissolution of the Republican Registration Commission independent trade unions still face enormous legal and practical hurdles during the registration process.
As in previous years, the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association had to deal with new cases of refusal to register independent trade unions at each and every sitting devoted to Belarus.
On 23 June, 534 self-employed workers of Belarus came together to establish their own trade union under the name "Razam" (together).
Some 100 joined "Razam" later to fight for decent working conditions in different workplaces, mostly street commerce and markets, where 70% of workers are women.
"Razam" promptly applied for the registration, which was refused by the Ministry of Justice.
The union appealed the Ministry's decision with relative success: in August, the Supreme Court ruled that the refusal was the result of a technical mistake and that "Razam" should just resubmit its registration papers.
"Razam" tried to engage in dialogue with the Ministry to ensure that its registration documents meet the legal requirements, and finally re-applied for registration on 13 December.
However, at the time of writing it was known that the Ministry had once again denied registration.
The government tried to improve its trade union rights record by reporting that four out of six organisations of the non-affiliated Radio-Electronic Workers' Union (REWU) had been registered in the first half of 2007.
However, these registrations were perceived as a manoeuvre to avoid EU sanctions, without any genuine commitment to the change.
Even the lucky four unions had to suffer humiliation before being registered.
A REWU organisation in the city of Borisov had been registered on its sixth attempt: before that, the registrar rejected the trade union's documents since it used a font size of 14 pt.
instead of 14.5 pt.
In June 2007 the leader of REWU organisation in Hrodna, just registered at its fourth attempt, declared that there had been so many administrative obstacles to overcome, so much humiliation, so much pressure on the rank-and-file members, that this has very much detracted from the joy of the organisation finally being registered.
Ministry to inspect trade union activities: On 15 June, an article titled "Information on Trade Union Activities" was published on the website of the Ministry of Justice.
This article targeted the BKDP-affiliated Free Metalworkers' Trade Union (SPM) and the Democratic Trade Union of Transport Workers, saying that earlier inspections of these trade unions uncovered "various violations of law", notably the trade unions' failure to confirm their "republican" (nationwide) status.
The ministry suggested that these trade unions should change their status, thus effectively limiting their scope of activities.
On 19 July, the Ministry of Justice announced, through its website, that its work plan for the second semester of 2007 included inspecting the activities of four trade unions.
Two of these unions were company-level organisations within the FPB structures; the other two were the Trade Union of Workers in the State Security Services and the SPM.
On 26 July the Ministry sent the SPM a letter requesting it to submit, on 14 August at the latest, its membership list (overall and in different organisational structures), registration dates and its organigram.
Such a request would arguably overstep the boundaries of national legislation, since, according to the law, trade unions are only obliged to provide their membership lists when being registered or reregistered.
SPM refused to provide the lists, since previous membership checks took place just a year ago and were accompanied by a parallel "verification" when trade union members were called to floor managers' offices, where an official from the local prosecutor's office would meet them and inquire whether these workers were trade union members or not.
A few months later regional governmental authorities were instructed to audit the activities of different SPM organisations at the enterprise level.
The SPM primary organisation at the "Lyos" company in the town of Baran and "Zenit" company in the town of Vileyka received official letters requesting them to allow the board of justice officials to "familiarise themselves with the documentation related to trade union chartered activities" (that is, activities under trade union constitution).
SPM believes that the government's objective is still to obtain the list of trade union members, which could be later used to make trade unionists feel vulnerable.
BKDP premises searched, trade unionist arrested: On 6 December, at around 8 p.m., the police paid an unexpected visit to the BKDP headquarters in Minsk.
Police officers said that they needed to "inspect the [BKDP] premises", since there was "something wrong with the office equipment".
No search warrant was presented; however, nobody was allowed to leave the BKDP offices, since the police gave the order to "wait for the experts".
Finally, a female police officer, accompanied by two special force officers, arrived to take photographs of trade union offices and to seize the office equipment and 500 trade union leaflets.
No official protocol of confiscation was issued.
Nikolai Sergeyenko, an activist of BKDP youth movement, was arrested on the spot for "using obscene language" – a charge frequently used to suppress trade unionists.
The BKDP immediately wrote to the Leniski district prosecutor's office, asking why trade union offices were intruded into and searched without due warrant.
No response followed until the end of the year.
Fined for distributing trade union newspaper: On 4 May in the city of Grodno the customs officials seized 281 copies of the Polish trade union newspaper "Solidarnosc Gurnica", which included an article about a meeting between Polish and Belarusian miners.
According to the authorities, newspapers in such quantities should have been transported by cargo vehicles, and failure to do so was enough to justify confiscation.
Aleksandr Tkachev, a trade union activist from BNP who carried the newspapers, said that they weighed less than five kilograms.
Not only were the papers never returned, but also Aleksandr was fined 310 thousand Belarusian roubles (approximately 92 euros) by the decision of the Court of Oktryabrski district of the city of Grodno of 22 May.
No trade union action allowed: A number of trade union mass activities were prohibited during the year, sometimes under preposterous pretexts.
A primary organisation of BNP at the "Grodno Azot" company (a nitrogen plant in the city of Hrodna) decided to hold a protest action on 17 May to draw attention to the violations of trade union rights.
City authorities did not allow this meeting to happen, since, according to the official decision, events such as the "Sovyetskaya Square could only take place if organised by municipal agencies".
In September-October city authorities, in a similar fashion, effectively banned trade union protests against the reforms of subsistence benefits and occupational pension schemes.
On 27 September Sergey Antusevich, the chairman of the "Grodno Azot" trade union organisation, received an official warning (signed by the city major Mr. Shapel) on "inadmissibility of disorderly behaviour, holding mass protests or picketing".
He has also been threatened with administrative and criminal sanctions.
A situation occurred in the city of Novopolotsk, where the BITU organisation at "Polimir" company was going to organise a protest action on 30 September, but the municipal authorities did not allow it.
The REWU planned to organise a series of pickets against the subsistence benefits reform in July.
Municipal authorities of the cities of Minsk, Zhlobin, Gomel and Borisov denied the permission to picket, since the official application submitted by REWU "did not comply with the requirements of the Law on Mass Activities".
What really happened was that REWU had been placed in a vicious-circle situation, where the municipal authorities would ask it to obtain prior consent from the local health authorities and the militia, while the health authorities refused to consent unless they had the prior agreement of the municipal authorities.
Perhaps the most "inventive" pretext to ban a trade union picket came on 23 July from the Zhlobin city authorities, who refused to issue permission, since "the problems trade unions were protesting against could not be resolved at the municipal level".
Trade union activities of a non-protest nature have also been restricted.
In November the above-mentioned BNP organisation at "Grodno Azot" requested the company management to provide them with rooms to celebrate the 15th anniversary of their activities at the enterprise.
The enterprise director said he could not meet the union's request: according to the instructions of the executive committee of the city of Hrodna, an anniversary could only be celebrated for 25 years or more.
A similar situation took place at the Lukoml city State Power Plant, where trade unions were initially allowed to celebrate their 15th anniversary in the Palace of Culture of Power Engineers.
However, just a day before the event, the union received a letter from the power plant director, saying that such celebrations would be a violation of the law on mass activities.
State-owned companies against independent trade unions: The system of short-term contracts given to virtually all workers – a system responsible for the loss of hundreds of members of independent trade unions – remains in place despite the ILO criticism.
Following the dispute about joining the FPB campaign to keep EU trade preferences, over 100 members of BNP at the "Polimir" company were forced to leave their trade union if they wanted their employment to be renewed.
In September, the Belarusian Free Trade Union (SPB) lost four members in the Pushkin State Pedagogical University (city of Brest), who resigned from the trade union while facing an ultimatum from the university administration.
The largest enterprise-level independent trade union, the BNP primary organisation at the "Belaruskaliy" company, is prevented from meeting their representatives at work.
On 9 October Vasili Korobov, the BNP president, was not allowed at "Belaruskaliy" and had his special access permit taken away.
The instruction to prevent the union leader from visiting his organisation was given by Anatoly Makhlai, the company's deputy director for human resource and ideology.
BNP wrote to the general director of "Belaruskaliy" and reported the incident to the prosecutor's office.
However, Mr. Korobov has still not been issued an access permit or granted an entrance to "Belaruskaliy" at the time of writing.
2007 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Belgium
Strong legislation: Workers have the right to form and join unions of their own choosing.
The law does not require trade unions to register.
However, every major conflict has been accompanied by attempts to force trade unions to acquire legal status.
A law dating back to 1991 grants special protection to staff representatives and deputies on work's councils and health and safety committees.
In addition to financial sanctions, the law provides for the possibility, but not the obligation, of reinstating workers who have been sacked for their trade union activities.
Trade union representatives who are not members of these two bodies have a lower level of protection.
Lack of worker representation in small companies: Workers from small companies are generally denied the right to collective representation.
The transposition of the EU directive on workers' information and consultation rights due by March 2005, and expected to bring in changes in that regard had still not taken place by the end of 2006 because of opposition from managers of SMEs and continued disagreement between the social partners.
The Belgian government has been summoned to appear before the European Court of Justice for failing to implement the directive.
Restrictions on the right to strike: The right to strike is recognised, as are collective bargaining rights, which are widely exercised.
However, legislative authorities have intentionally refrained from defining the scope of the right to strike.
Right to strike heavily penalised: Employers have been trying for several years to obtain the legal prohibition of certain strike-related activities.
Their approach has been to petition the courts to ban certain forms of action, such as picketing.
This are generally accompanied by requests that these acts be subject to fines if the ban is disregarded.
Any union which decides to ignore such a ban, for example, by maintaining picket lines, ends up being heavily penalised.
Employers have used these methods again since 2004, despite the conclusion of a "gentlemen's agreement" between the social partners in March 2002.
Under this agreement the employers would avoid using legal procedures until all conciliation attempts failed, whilst the workers agreed to respect the notice periods required for strikes.
Meanwhile, the Belgian government failed to amend its legislation to prevent recourse to the law in ways that could undermine legitimate use of the right to strike.
As a result, many employers again issued unilateral petitions to the courts, for example during the general strike in 2005.
According to a study on the legal decisions taken at this time, the courts generally found that preventing employees or third parties wishing to enter a company building from doing so amounted to an assault, irrespective of whether or not any violence was used.
Some judges also agreed to issue "preventive" orders in the absence of any concrete indications that assaults might be committed.
More examples occurred in 2006 (see below).
These decisions have significantly restricted the right to strike and are considered by the unions to be in breach of the case law of the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association.
International Trade Union Confederation, 2008 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Benin, 20 November 2008, available at: http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/4c52caa326.html [accessed 20 September 2010]
2008 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Benin
Government approval: The Labour Code recognises the right to form and join trade unions.
At present, unions must deposit their statutes with the Ministry of the Interior to obtain legal recognition, or they will be penalised with a fine.
The government agreed to modify the Labour Code so that unions would not have to seek government approval before being legalised, but has not yet done so.
Limitations on the right to strike: The right to strike is recognised in both the public and private sectors.
Three days' strike notice is required and unions must say in advance how long a strike will last.
The law allows the government to requisition civil servants in the event of a strike.
It also allows the government to declare a strike illegal for specific causes such as a threat to social peace and order.
Trade union rights in practice and Violations in 2007
Brutal treatment of strikers by a minister: On 25 May, Nestor Dako, the Minister of Justice, chose disdain rather than dialogue when faced by a group of demonstrators who had come to remind him of their demands.
Activists from the legal services and allied workers' union (Syndicat national des travailleuses et travailleurs des services judiciaires et assimilés du Bénin, SYNTRAJAB) had been on strike since 7 May to protest against their poor working conditions.
Supported by their national confederation, the Union nationale des syndicats des travailleurs du Bénin (UNSTB), the strikers had organised a march calling at the Ministry of Justice and ending up with a sit-in at the Ministry of Labour and the Civil Service.
Refusing to meet the demonstrators, Nestor Dako attempted to leave his ministry by car.
As the group prevented him leaving, he ordered his driver to drive through them.
Three trade unionists, including Emmanuel Zounon, the General Secretary of the UNSTB, were stuck in a dangerous position between the ministry car and a UNSTB vehicle.
Prior authorisation: The administrative formalities for registering trade unions are delaying or preventing the legalisation of new workers' organisations.
At the end of the year, the union representing vendors at Ouando market (SYNAMAMO-BENIN), which had sent its statutes in August to the prefecture of Ouémé-Plateau, was still waiting to be registered, despite the intervention of the UNSTB, its national centre.
2009 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Botswana
Ministry has power to interfere in union affairs: Registration of trade unions, via the Registrar at the Ministry of Labour, is compulsory.
The law requires a minimum of 30 employees in order to form a trade union, and the Trade Disputes Act empowers the Labour Minister to determine the conditions for union membership.
If a trade union is not registered, union committee members are not protected against anti-union discrimination.
Unions are allowed to affiliate to international trade unions and receive funds from outside the country without the Minister's approval.
The right to strike: The 2004 Trade Disputes Act gives the government extensive power over industrial relations.
The right to strike is recognised, but workers must submit their demands to complex arbitration procedures, which unions say always result in strikes being declared illegal.
Sympathy strikes are prohibited.
The Act does not protect workers' organisations against acts of interference by employers and their organisations.
Export processing zone: The same labour laws apply to Botswana's export processing zone as to the rest of the country.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2008
Employer hostility and hypocrisy: Although labour legislation has improved in many areas over recent years and the government has ratified all ILO core labour standards, many employers still trample workers' rights, and the government is also either unable or unwilling to confront employers.
Trades unions criticise the behaviour of foreign investors who, too often, maximise their profits on their workers' backs, going as far as to invoke their poor knowledge of English as an excuse for refusing to negotiate with their workers.
This applies in particular to the many Chinese employers in the retail distribution trade.
In July the management of Sinohydro, a Chinese company building the Dikgatlhong dam at Robelela, refused to negotiate with representatives of workers who had just gone on strike.
The employer stated that the strike was illegal and called the strike committee a "group of terrorists".
He also added that he had "assigned our Public Relations Officers to guide workers on how to set up a proper committee".
Working conditions in this company are said to be deplorable (lodging, hygiene and safety, non-renewable three-month contracts, etc.
).
Strikers still waiting for a court decision: The industrial tribunal still has to give its ruling in appeal on the two labour disputes that broke out in 2004 and 2006 in the Debswana and BCL companies.
In both cases the management tried to undermine the Botswana Mine Workers Union (BMWU).
In 2004, 461 workers at Debswana were sacked for taking part in a strike that was ruled illegal by the authorities.
In 2006, the management of BCL, a subsidiary of LionOre, supported a dissident union, several of whose leaders were in prison for corruption, which encouraged the workers to hold a strike that the management knew would be illegal.
The manoeuvre resulted in the sacking of 181 strikers.
Hopes that the new contract law would quietly help promote freedom of association at the same time as promoting other rights are now very much in question.
However, recent protests and media coverage of illegal dismissals suggest that at the very least the law will be a focus for worker activists and their supporters in their campaign to demand more rights and that worker’s knowledge of the law (both new and existing) can only increase with each day leading to a rise in collective action and legal consciousness.
The role of the ACFTU remains very much unclear.
[A forthcoming article will look more closely at the new law’s provisions regarding trade union action and the possibilities for the ACFTU to step up and support growing worker action]
Since this news emerged the ACFTU announced that it was investigating the reports of mass lay-offs with the result that “Huawei Technologies Co Ltd agreed to suspend its controversial "voluntary resignation" scheme after holding talks with trade unions, the All China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) said on Saturday”.
Xinhua also reported that “The ACFTU said it had called on China's biggest maker of telecommunications network equipment to protect workers' interests after its plan sparked fears the company was trying to sidestep a new labour law.
The ACFTU and unions in Guangdong Province and Shenzhen called on Huawei to solicit workers' opinions and respect their rights while making regulations that will benefit them.
Huawei will soon hold a workers' conference to review the interim regulations, sources with the ACFTU said on Saturday.
A company source confirmed on condition of anonymity that a consensus had been reached with the trade unions.
He said the company had agreed to suspend the plan, but the exact date for when the decision will become final will be decided after workers' have their say at the conference.” [Xinhua 12 November 2007]
Since then all has been quiet.
According to one observer, since the public debate over the legality of the sackings emerged, authorities issued an order last week to cease all coverage of the Huawei employment issue and to make no attempt to question Huawei staff about it.
Xinhua only reported the ACFTU findings because the trade union federation is an “official” source.
“The fact that the media has been silenced has presumably got something to do with the influence of Huawei president Ren Zhengfei, formerly a senior People’s Liberation Army officer.
Incidentally, an article in Forbes back in 2004 spoke of Huawei’s “opaque ownership”: The company says 1% belongs to Ren (enough to land him on the FORBES list of China’s 200 richest people at $96 million) and the rest to a “union” whose principals Huawei has never identified.
Adding to the air of mystery, Ren rarely accepts press interviews (including the one requested for this article); instead, he dispatches insiders to public events.
Set against a global wariness among businesspeople regarding China’s dismal record of intellectual-property protection, it’s an approach that makes Huawei a magnet for suspicion, even as it consistently delivers winning products (routers, switches and wireless networking equipment, among other things).
[Beijing Newspeak; The harmonization of the Huawei debate ]
Earlier China Labour Bulletin wrote that The Southern Metro News (Nanfang Dushi Bao) on 12 September reported that several substitute teachers from a number of different schools in Shenzhen have been given notice while five substitute teachers from the Longhua Primary School, who had worked at the school for an average of 15 years all were given notification of early retirement on the same day.
While the Morning News (Xinwen Chen Bao) wrote that in Shanghai, several workers employed for over three years without a written contract have complained to their union about systematic intimidation from employers.
Eight employees have already been made redundant.
[NOTE 2] Although workers are supposed to be given contracts, the new Labour Contract Law gives specific and concrete penalties for failing to provide a detailed written contract.
“For a company that has long embraced the virtues of global sourcing, Wal-Mart’s decision to cut its global procurement headcount by over 250 has come of something of a surprise.
And with China the region hit most severely by the cuts – reports suggest that more than 100 staff could go in the company’s Shanghai, Putian and Dongguan divisions – the move seems to suggest that the US retail giant is intending to shift its focus away from the far east and could soon be switching its attention to India.
The company’s PR head Jonathan Dong has insisted that the cuts have nothing to do with the China’s new Labour Contract Law, which comes into affect on January 1 2008, but the decision has already brought a chorus of derision from Chinese law experts who claim that the headcount reductions go against existing legislation which states that companies can only implement job cuts once all other avenues have been explored.
"
As many know the ACFTU, while not playing a particularly strong role in defending worker rights to say the very least, has had a history of some success in terms of legislative influence )(both the labour law and the Trade union law show this clearly).
It has a strong input into the drafting of the New Labour Contract law.
While the final version certainly watered down many more pro-union aspects it remains a potential tool for both ACFTU internal goals of strengthening its footing within companies and for the ACFTU to help campaign rights such as collective bargaining and the drafting of (good) collective contracts
Not only did the ACFTU very publicly intervened in the case of Huawei but Xinhua reported on 3 December 2007 that the All-China Federation of Trade Unions has warned employers they will face dire consequences if they try to evade their responsibilities under the new Labour Contract Law by coercing staff into accepting less favourable employment terms.
ACFTU officials stated that local ACFTU branches would investigate any complaints filed by union members and provide legal help to complainants who wanted to sue their employers.
The new law is being touted by many as the most significant labour related reform for decades.
Many officials in China appear to be using the introduction of the new law as a cure for almost all the ills of the current condition of the working classes – from lack of contracts, to easing social unrest to resolving the issues of overtime.
Certainly the law will have significant impacts but a lot is riding on both the interpretation of the law and its implementation.
The new law contains some clauses on how to bridge this new law and the previous legislation but there has been little discussion on how to implement the new law.
Currently the labour law sets out specifically those written contracts must be signed between the employer and the employee and yet according to official figures less than 20% of workers have signed contracts in small and medium sized enterprises.
In October, the Dongguan City Labour Department released a draft of a new standard labour contract.
IHLO has translated the draft here and extracted relevant clauses below.
It is believed – as with most other contracts being prepared that the main drafter is the Labour department and it is not clear how much negotiation or input there has been from the ACFTU.
Certainly the new draft contract in Dongguan raises some very worrying legal and ethical issues which call into question the significance of the new law to actually change working conditions and improve labour rights in any meaningful way.
Article 25 of the current Labour Law states:
The current laws cover go-slows which under current trade union law are allowed:
Article 27 In case of work-stoppage or slow-down strike in an enterprise or institution, the trade union shall, on behalf of the workers and staff members, hold consultation with the enterprise or institution or the parties concerned, present the opinions and demands of the workers and staff members, and put forth proposals for solutions.
With respect to the reasonable demands made by the workers and staff members, the enterprise or institution shall try to satisfy them.
The trade union shall assist the enterprise or institution in properly dealing with the matter so as to help restore the normal order of production and other work as soon as possible.
Many workers are engaged in work which, due to either the nature of the work or (perhaps more widespread) the failure of the employer to install adequate OSH safeguards and the majority do not obtain health check son departure.
This leads to the type of scenario that many workers affected by occupational disease find themselves in.
They leave their factory and later find themselves ill and then have little legal or practical means to obtain compensation form their previous employer as they have no current contractual relationship and the employer denies liability.
This is the case which workers affected by Silicosis and cadmium poisoning for example find themselves in and one of the main reasons why their struggle for compensation has been such a long campaign.
[See for example the case of the Gold peak workers and Gemstone workers]
1. is engaging in operations exposing him to occupational disease hazards and has not undergone an occupational health check-up before he leaves his post, or is suspected of having an occupational disease and is being diagnosed or under medical observation;
2. has been confirmed as having lost or partially lost his capacity to work due to an occupational disease or a work-related injury during his employment with the employer;
One rather optimistic report by the first-ever joint European-Chinese research study on the Chinese labour market by the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences (SASS) and the Adecco Institute (London)[ see here ] done in cooperation with the University of Warwick (UK) released on 7 December is correct in stating that companies should not look to the possible negative effects of the new law such as the possibility of increased wage bills and less flexibility in shedding unwanted workers but rather they should see the economic benefits of a more transparent and stable workforce as opposed to the current situation of high staff turnover and resulting lack of unskilled workers; “The new laws provide a strategic roadmap for the next 10-15 years.
They will slow the rapid rate of workforce turnover and bring more procedural transparency to labour dispute resolution.
They provide better protection for trade secrets and incentives for employers to invest in vocational training for workers.
They also permit new forms of flexible work and third-party labour placement.”
"We regard the planned Chinese labour law reforms as a breakthrough and big leap towards International labour market standards.
Collective wage agreements, employment rights that are enforceable by law and dismissal protection no longer remain taboos in China.
The new labour laws have unmistakable German and British flavours.
It is a good example of China's increasing openness to adopt foreign best practices", said Wolfgang Clement, Chairman of the Adecco Institute and former German minister for Economics and Labour.
"Perhaps most importantly, the Chinese government will enforce new labour laws across all provinces in a more effective way than until now.
This would be one of the most spectacular, confidence-building reforms in new China", Siderman added.
As of yet it is hard to find an example of any labour related law that has been enforced across all provinces effectively and until we see related investments in enforcement (such as labour inspection, monitoring and steady support by the judiciary in cases of abuse) we cannot see such glowing predications as anything other than hope.
According to a recent online survey by China Youth Daily, 14.5% of the 2,212 respondents said their employers intended to rearrange contracts with long-time workers, and 87.4% disagreed that the new Labour Contract Law would give protection to employees.
A National People’s Congress survey on implementation of the labour law found that fewer than 20% of small-and-medium-sized private companies had signed contracts with their workers, while 60% of the contracts used by those that had them were short term, lasting one year or less, thus revealing the work that needs to be done.

2009 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Bulgaria
The blanket prohibition of strikes in public administration remains in force despite the decisions of the ILO and the Council of Europe.
A group of individuals tried to charge the leaders of striking trade unions under anti-discrimination provisions.
A woman trade union leader was attacked, possibly connected to her trade union activities.
Freedom of association: The constitution provides for the right of all workers to form or join trade unions, with the exception of the military.
Public servants are covered by a separate law, which recognises their freedom of association.
The Council of Europe criticised Order No.
1 of 15 August 2002, which stipulates that foreign workers can be founders of a trade union subject to prior authorisation.
Where collective agreements are concluded between representative trade unions and employer organisations at the sectoral level, they can be extended to cover all enterprises in the sector, but only at the discretion of the minister.
Public servants do not have the right to strike – they are only allowed to engage in "symbolic strikes", which means displaying signs, arm-bands, badges or protest banners and not withdrawing their labour.
"Political strikes" are prohibited.
In the railway transport sector, the right to strike is severely limited (a 50% minimum service is required in the event of a strike).
On 16 October 2006, the European Committee of Social Rights (ECSR) concluded that a number of strike restrictions, including the total ban on strikes in the civil service and the high minimum service thresholds were incompatible with the Revised European Social Charter.
This decision supported the collective complaint submitted in 2005 by the two national trade union confederations (CITUB and Podkrepa, both affiliated to the ITUC) and the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC).
While the government removed the strike ban for energy, communications and healthcare workers, no changes were made as regards the civil service or the railways.
Dispute resolution: The National Institute for Reconciliation and Arbitration was set up in 2003 for out-of-court resolution of collective labour disputes.
The Institute provides mediation and arbitration, filling a major gap in the industrial relations system.
There are no mechanisms for resolving collective labour disputes in the branches and activities where strikes are prohibited.
Protection from discrimination: The Act on Protection Against Discrimination has been in force since January 2004.
Employees can appeal against discrimination before the Commission on Protection Against Discrimination.
Trade unions may claim discrimination against their members, if the member requests them to.
However, the burden of proof rests entirely on the employee.
In the view of the Council of Europe's ECSR, the protection for trade union representatives against unlawful dismissal based on their status or activities is not adequate.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2008
Frequent harassment: In recent years, the unions have reported frequent cases of discrimination and harassment against trade union activists and members, who have been relocated, downgraded or sacked.
This has created fear and insecurity, often making workers reluctant to join a trade union.
The legal proceedings for the reinstatement of dismissed workers can take a long time, sometimes years, while the sanctions against employers for unfair dismissal are too weak to be dissuasive.
In the private sector, some employers have simply banned trade union membership within their enterprise and have forced newly employed workers to sign declarations that they will not establish or join trade unions.
Temporary employment contracts are increasingly being used to prevent workers from demanding their rights, as the Labour Code does not adequately protect workers with temporary contracts.
Threats: On 16 July Ekaterina Yordanova, President of the Federation of Transport Trade Unions in Bulgaria and a member of the CITUB executive committee and of Sofia city council, was attacked.
The International Transport Workers' Federation called for a thorough investigation, recalling that a similar, seemingly unmotivated attack against a woman trade union leader had taken place in 2007.
Teachers' trade union accused of discrimination: Following the 2007 large-scale strikes in public education, an association of parents lodged a complaint with the Commission for Protection Against Discrimination accusing Yanka Takeva, President of the CITUB-affiliated National Federation of Teachers' Unions (SEB), and Krum Krumov, President of the teachers' union affiliated to Podkrepa, of discrimination between public and private schools.
They argued that students in public schools had suffered from the strike whilst those in private schools had not.
Trade unions believe that this was an attempt to curtail the teachers' right to strike.
In September, the Commission decided that Takeva and Krumov should be tried for discrimination by an administrative court.
No court decision had been reached by the end of the year.
2009 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Burundi
The Head of State made direct threats to the trade unions, whom he accused of being "in the pocket" of the political parties.
Intimidation and harassment against the trade unions persist and are getting worse.
It was a bad year for trade union rights.
Severe restrictions in the civil service: The right to organise and the right to strike in the civil service are regulated by Law No.
1/015 of 29 November 2002.
The national trade union centre COSYBU says that this law contains many violations of the freedom of association and the right to strike.
Notably, it bans solidarity strikes, permits requisition orders in the event of strike action, and says that for civil servants' unions to be recognised, they must be registered with the Civil Service Ministry – which is their employer.
Restrictions on elections of trade union leaders: Those wanting to stand for union office must have worked in the sector for more than a year.
The government has promised it will review this.
Restricted right to strike: Workers can go on strike, but only when, and if, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security says it is satisfied that they have exhausted all other peaceful means to resolve a dispute, effectively giving the Ministry the power to veto all strikes.
The workers must then give their employer six days' notice.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2008
Background: Violence and insecurity were rife throughout the year.
The rebel forces, the army and the ruling party militias were responsible for numerous abuses.
The authorities exploited the political tensions to harass the trade unions, civil society organisations and opposition parties.
Interference in the trade union activities of magistrates: The lack of any legal provisions guaranteeing their union rights has continued to prevent the registering of the magistrates' union, Syndicat des magistrats du Burundi (SYMABU), thereby reducing its potential activities.
Throughout the year SYMABU protested at the authorities' refusal to implement the collective agreements negotiated in 2003 on improving magistrates working conditions.
In 2007 the police went as far as banning public meetings by the union.
Union leader in prison: On 15 September, the police arrested and imprisoned Juvénal Rududura, vice-president of the judiciary lay workers union SYPEMJ, for making "false statements", after denouncing corruption at the Ministry of Labour.
The union went on strike in May to demand the implementation of collective agreements signed in March.
At the end of 2008, Juvénal Rududura was still being held without trial.
Government interference in trade union affairs: On 23 May, in a message to the nation, the Head of State, Pierre Nkurunziza, accused the trade unions of frequently being in the pockets of the political parties and striking against the authorities.
He threatened them directly, stating that he would punish such behaviour to make an example of them.
Several trade union leaders have been imprisoned or suspended from their work in recent years following strike action.
Education International (EI) reports that the teachers' union, Syndicat des Travailleurs de l'Enseignement du Burundi (STEB), is not allowed to hold any general meetings without first notifying the town hall, which is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.
On 22 February the education unions organised a demonstration in Bujumbura to protest at the wave of violence against teachers.
Eulalie Nibizi, President of the STEB, denounced acts of intimidation by some local authorities who were pressuring unions into denying the violence.
On 25 September, the COSYBU reported that the harassment and intimidation of trade union leaders had intensified.
Agreements not put into practice: Civil service, education and health unions repeatedly expressed their frustration over pay.
Trade union representatives denounced serious shortcomings, injustices and irregularities in the way in which the pay rises promised in 2007 had been applied.
Private sector anti-union: Many private sector employers systematically prevent the creation of trade unions, while the government fails to protect workers from anti-union employers.
2008 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Cambodia
Following the murders of Chea Vichea and Ros Sovannareth in 2004, a third leader of the FTUWKC was shot down in February 2007.
Restrictions on the trade union rights of civil servants remain in place, and although private sector workers have seen some improvements, they continue to be confronted with the whole arsenal of anti-union measures when they attempt to defend their rights.
The Cambodian judiciary discredited itself further by ordering that the two innocent parties accused of murdering Chea Vichea be kept in prison.
Freedom of association – civil servants excluded: Workers are free to form and join trade unions under the 1997 Labour Law.
However, this law does not apply to domestic staff or civil servants, including teachers, judges and military personnel.
Personnel working in air and maritime transportation are not fully subject to the law but are free to form unions.
The Labour Law requires unions and employers' organisations to file a charter and list of officials with the Ministry of Labour and Vocational Training (MOLVT).
The Bureau of Labour Relations is responsible for facilitating union registration and the application for "most representative" status.
The MOLVT is also responsible for enforcing the Labour Code and the application of ILO Conventions.
Restrictions on the right to strike: The law guarantees the right to strike but limits that right by imposing a minimum service requirement in all enterprises, regardless of whether they are public utilities or not, and regardless of whether they exceed the need to comply with statutory safety requirements.
Workers who are required to provide a minimum service but stay out on strike are considered guilty of serious misconduct.
Another major problem in law is caused by confusion between the role of shop stewards and labour union leaders.
Each workplace with over eight employees must have a shop steward.
Shop steward elections are held at the factory, and the law provides that employers are the ones who must organise them.
It gives representative unions the right to nominate the shop stewards to stand for election but, often, stewards are elected before a union is organised in a factory.
Article 284 gives shop stewards the duty to present employers with issues related to grievances and wages, and to enforce the labour law and collective agreements.
These are functions that rightfully belong in the hands of elected trade union leaders.
In a number of cases, employers have used factory representatives (who are elected for two years and cannot be forced out) to block the path of unions to the bargaining table, because shop stewards are the only worker representatives with legally enforceable bargaining rights.
The labour law fails to provide a similarly enforceable right for trade union leaders.
Trade union rights in practice and Violations in 2007
Background: Prime Minister Hun Sen remains persistent in his attacks on national and international critics of Cambodia's human rights record.
He even attacks the ILO when he is not entirely satisfied with its reports on working conditions in the garment sector, inferring that some ILO officers may be corrupt.
Only a small proportion of the total labour force is unionised, and outside the garment and tourism/hospitality sectors, the trade union movement remains very weak.
Most workers have little or no knowledge of trade unions, or of their labour rights.
Trade union leader Hy Vuthy assassinated: On 24 February 2007, two helmeted men on motorbikes shot down Hy Vuthy, President of the Free Trade Union of Workers of the Kingdom of Cambodia (FTUWKC) at the Suntex garment factory, whilst he was on his way home from work.
They threw his body into a rubbish dump before taking flight.
The witnesses to the murder refused to speak out for fear of reprisals.
Hy Vuthy had received several anonymous death threats in 2006 on account of his union activities.
In 2006, three other FTUWKC leaders at the Suntex factory had also been injured in attacks.
The Vice President of the union was hit by a bullet in his left leg.
Trade union rights violated with impunity: ILO projects such as the Better Factories initiative have contributed to improving respect for freedom of association in Cambodia's main industry, the garment sector.
In spite of such initiatives and the efforts of certain international buyers, much still remains to be done before employers will widely accept unions as partners to be engaged with as equals.
In many factories, trade unionists continue to face repression of all kinds, including beatings from hired thugs, death threats, blacklisting, false accusations to bring them before the courts, wage deductions and exclusion from promotion, etc.
The government very rarely prosecutes or takes measures against an employer for anti-union practices.
In many instances, the Ministry of Labour's advice is for workers to take their case to court – which is costly and ineffective – or to accept cash settlements from employers.
Labour inspectors are poorly trained and, given their low pay, open to bribery.
In cases where the MOLVT does rule in favour of the workers, it rarely uses its legal authority to penalise employers who fail to follow its orders.
Violence against trade unionists: The hiring of thugs is a tactic regularly used to scare workers fighting for trade union rights.
To give one example, on 24 January, at approximately 8:30 pm, Sen Sithourn, FTUWKC General Secretary at the Shoe Premier Factory, was beaten on his way home from work by four or five masked individuals armed with iron rods.
Violence is most commonly used against strikers, and in some instances it is the police who are called in to forcefully curb any attempts at trade union action (see below).
Yellow unions: The establishment of yellow unions is another tactic deployed by some Cambodian companies to prevent the emergence of genuine workers' representatives.
Several unions genuinely fighting for the workers have condemned the Khmer Youth Trade Union (KYTU) for its conduct in this respect.
The Coalition of Cambodian Apparel Workers' Democratic Union (CCAWDU), for example, reported that in June whilst engaged in negotiations with Winner Garments Ltd., a leader of the KYTU threatened the CCAWDU negotiators and gave them a CD concerning unions attacked by the government.
Shorter employment contracts for unionists: Several free trade unions reported that their members were increasingly being hired on short-term employment contracts, to discourage any kind of trade union activity.
A rise in the attempts to bribe shop stewards was also reported.
Trade unionists dismissed: In the absence of a government that offers any real protection for trade union rights, some employers summarily dismiss workers identified as trade union activists.
The FTUWKC reported the sacking in August of Keo Sokun and Mok Mon, two of its elected representatives at the New Mingda Garment factory in the Dangkao district of Phnom Penh (the management claims that they did not work well and that it had dismissed them prior to discovering that they were union representatives).
At the Hong Da garment factory, a member of the Cambodian Union Federation (CUF) was dismissed just days after being elected president of the union at the factory.
Thanks to the intervention of the CUF and the International Textile, Garment and Leather Workers' Federation (ITGLWF), he was, however, reinstated some weeks later.
Chea Vichea's family expressed its conviction that Born Samnang and Sok Sam Oeun are not guilty of the crime, as did the main witness at the murder scene, Var Sothy, who has had to flee the country, fearing for his life.
The ITUC joined forces with six major international human rights organisations to urge the Cambodian authorities to acquit and release the two innocent men and to carry out a full and impartial investigation into the murder (see the 2006 Annual Survey of the Violations of Trade Union Rights for more details).
The Arbitration Council, a tripartite body established under the labour law, has effectively substituted the Labour Courts.
The council is widely respected for its even-handed and impartial investigations and rulings.
However, its decisions are not final, and employers found to have engaged in anti-union discrimination usually appeal against the council's decisions in the provincial courts.
Collective bargaining: Collective bargaining is difficult, and only a few unions have achieved an enforceable agreement.
It was not until late 2003 – six years after the passage of the labour law – that garment and tourism worker unions won their first proper collective bargaining agreements.
Teachers' association activity obstructed: The Cambodian Independent Teachers Association (CITA) is registered by the Ministry of the Interior as a civic association, but is not recognised by the MOLVT as a trade union, and is not therefore deemed eligible to represent teachers in collective bargaining procedures.
The demonstrations and other protests it has organised have often been prohibited.
CITA has been a frequent target of harassment, intimidation and surveillance by the government authorities.
It only represents 10% of Cambodian teachers, as many fear that joining it would hinder their prospects of a promotion.
Civil servants' association not recognised for bargaining: Like CITA, the Cambodian Independent Civil Service Association (CICSA) is registered as a civic association, but it is not recognised by the government as a union and does not enjoy collective bargaining rights.
Its leaders believe that fears of harassment and demotion go some way toward explaining why only around 500 of the 100,000 civil servants in Cambodia are affiliated to it.
Trade unionists reinstated at River Rich thanks to international solidarity: In October 2006, the workers at the River Rich garment factory decided to form a union, mainly to defend themselves against the management's practice of hiring up to 80 per cent of the workforce on temporary contracts.
This is common practice in the garment sector and is used as a means of dissuading workers, anxious to see their contracts renewed, from defending their rights.
In spite of the intimidation, union elections were held at River Rich, but some days later the management fired the 30 trade union members and representatives.
Trade union rights ignored at Angkor Wat sites: Several trade unions representing workers involved in projects to restore the Angkor temple complex remain deprived of recognition.
These projects are implemented by government teams for safeguarding Angkor, the Japanese government team (JSA) from Sophia University in Tokyo and the Chinese government team for safeguarding Angkor (CSA).
A union was also formed to represent the workers employed to conserve the environment around Angkor Wat by ASPARA, an authority set up by the government and which already stood out in 2006 for its anti-union dismissals.
In the face of the organisations' anti-union repression and discrimination, the Cambodian Construction Workers' Trade Union Federation (CCTUF), affiliated to the BWI, filed a complaint with the Labour Ministry regarding their violations of the Cambodian labour legislation at the restoration sites.
It has not yet seen any results.
2008 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Cameroon
Civil servants who defied the prohibition on strikes were arrested and/or subjected to disciplinary action.
Trade union leaders are frequently dismissed.
There also appears to be widespread government interference in trade union matters.
Government authorisation: The 1996 Constitution of Cameroon guarantees freedom of association and the right to strike, and both rights are set out in the 1992 Labour Code.
It is illegal to form a union that includes both public and private sector workers.
However, the Labour Code provides for prison sentences and fines for workers who form a trade union and carry out trade union activities without a registration certificate from the Union Registry.
The Labour Code is not applicable to members of the public service, judges, military, national intelligence, prison administration and auxiliary administrative personnel.
Public servants may form trade unions, but must have the prior approval of the Minister for Territorial Administration and may not affiliate internationally without obtaining prior authorisation.
The ILO has urged the government to amend its legislation to ensure that public service workers can form unions without government authorisation.
Limitations on the right to strike: The Constitution and the Labour Code recognise workers' right to strike, but only after compulsory arbitration.
Ignoring the procedure can be sanctioned by immediate dismissal and fines.
Workers have an obligation to provide a minimum service in certain sectors, including transport, which does not fall within the ILO definition of essential services.
Civil servants do not have the right to strike.
Collective bargaining – weak enforcement measures: The law provides for collective bargaining between workers and management, as well as between trade union federations and employers' associations, but the legal mechanisms for enforcing collective agreements are ineffectual.
Fears of an even more restrictive Labour Code: The government has embarked on a review of the Labour Code and there is reason to fear that the proposed amendments will further limit trade union rights, particularly by introducing a more restrictive registration procedure.
It appears that the new Code will grant the Union Registry additional powers, enabling it to revoke the registration certificate of a union and limit the protection enjoyed by trade union officials.
Export processing zones: Firms operating in the EPZs are exempt from certain aspects of the Labour Code, but must comply with internationally recognised labour standards.
An official notice from the National Office for Industrial Free Zones contains a list of "incentives".
It also states that employers enjoy "flexibility in hiring/firing workers".
Trade union rights in practice and Violations in 2007
Government interference: In recent years, the government has interfered in trade union activities in several ways.
The government has a reputation for favouring those workers' organisations it sees as easier to control and has used excessively strict union registration requirements as a means to withhold recognition from trade unions that it considers to be too independent.
One clear example is that the public service confederation has, since its creation in 2000, been one of the six trade union centres in Cameroon that have still not been recognised.
Similarly when industrial disputes arise, the government chooses the union with which it will negotiate.
The government sometimes demands that workers setting up a union produce job descriptions signed by the employer before a union can be registered.
This makes it impossible for self-employed workers and workers in the informal economy to form a union.
Striking prison wardens arrested and penalised: A dispute that broke out in December 2006 at a prison in Yaoundé spread to 20 of Cameroon's 70 prisons.
The prison staff, who are not allowed to organise or join a union, were demanding better working conditions and pay rises.
On 2 January, 71 wardens, including more than 20 women, were arrested and held in custody at the Ministry of Defence until 13 January.
Several of them were allegedly beaten and tortured.
On 5 January the Minister for Justice announced that 125 prison workers had been suspended for four months with no pay.
Eight trade union activists dismissed in the audiovisual sector: On 6 and 17 November, eight journalists and other professional staff of the audiovisual group TV+ were dismissed for "organising and taking part in a work stoppage that caused enormous material and immaterial damages to the company".
The union leaders had called a strike, held on 29 October, to demand employment contracts, social security for all employees, the payment of salary arrears, pay rises and the regular payment of salaries.
2007 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Chile
The Philharmonic orchestra sacked its members for belonging to a union and a salmon producer tried to scare its employees into signing individual contracts and abandoning collective bargaining.
Public sector workers still do not have the right to strike.
Legal protection of collective bargaining rights remains inadequate.
Basic trade union rights recognised: Workers have the right to form unions without prior authorisation.
The right to collective bargaining is recognised, as is the right to strike, but only in the private sector.
The Trade Union Rights' Law, adopted in December 2001, put an end to many of the restrictions of the President Pinochet era.
Notably, the government is no longer allowed to interfere in the internal organisation of trade unions.
Collective bargaining restrictions: Collective bargaining is only guaranteed at company level.
The 2001 law provides for "voluntary" collective bargaining, meaning that trade unions can negotiate national deals only if the employer agrees.
Similarly, while temporary workers – defined in the Labour Code as working in agriculture, construction, ports or the arts and entertainment sector – may form unions, they can only conduct collective bargaining if the employer is willing.
Changes in the Labour Code facilitate collective bargaining in the agricultural sector, but it is still subject to the employers' willingness to negotiate.
Company unions can only engage in collective bargaining if the respective employers are prepared to do so.
Restrictions on strike action: Workers in the public sector do not have the right to strike, although in the past teachers, municipal workers and health workers have all carried out strikes.
In some 30 companies disputes are subject to compulsory arbitration.
Strikes by agricultural workers during the harvest season are prohibited.
Protection: An employee has the right to sue for unfair dismissal within 60 days.
If he or she is found to have been unfairly dismissed, a 30 per cent surcharge will be added to the redundancy package.
If a judge finds that a worker has been dismissed for trade union activities, he or she has the right to return to work or receive compensation.
Some categories of workers are excluded from this clause.
Companies may be penalised for breaking labour laws, and every six months, the government publishes a list of companies that have breached labour laws.
Anti-union practices remain, including the barring of union leaders' access to companies, unilateral changes to working times, replacement of striking workers and threatening dismissal in order to prevent the forming of trade unions.
Various reforms have eliminated most of the authoritarian aspects of the Constitution introduced by Pinochet in 1990.
Premeditated dismissal of the union at the Philharmonic orchestra: On 4 September, 17 musicians from the Philharmonic orchestra were dismissed and the management started to harass the remaining members of the orchestra to leave the union and give up their collective agreement.
On 29 September, another 18 members of the union received dismissal notices, leaving behind only the union representatives.
In July, the Cultural Corporation of Santiago transported an entire symphony orchestra from Poland to replace the Santiago Philharmonic orchestra, thereby confirming persistent rumours dating back to 2003.
AquaChile salmon company criticised for its anti-union practices: The salmon farming company in Puerto Montt, AquaChile SA, which is the largest salmon producer in the country and the second largest in the world, was denounced for its anti-union practices against workers in two unions at the company.
In the middle of the collective bargaining process, the manager of the plant called in the workers and threatened that if they did not accept the collective agreement in its current form the company would dismiss the workforce and the union leaders.
Also, on 10 July, the buses transporting workers to the factory were diverted on the orders of the management, which proceeded to threaten the workers and try to get them to sign individual agreements and give up the bargaining process.
The company reached an agreement with a parallel association of workers with 120 members.
In its official complaint against AquaChile S.A. the trade union stated that "this behaviour by the company constitutes a clear violation of constitutional principles".
2008 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Chile
A subcontracted forestry worker lost his life in clashes with the police.
Anti-union practices have increased by over 40 per cent.
Subcontracting is a serious problem.
The Congress passed a subcontracting law that was appealed against by multinationals.
The legislation obliges them to employ subcontracted workers on their roll of permanent staff.
There were cases of mistreatment and excessive use of force by the police.
Workers in the public sector are still deprived of the right to strike.
Legal protection of the right to collective bargaining remains insufficient.
Basic trade union rights recognised: Workers have the right to form unions without prior authorisation.
The right to collective bargaining is recognised, as is the right to strike, but only in the private sector.
Collective bargaining restrictions: Collective bargaining is only guaranteed at company level.
The 2001 law provides for "voluntary" collective bargaining, meaning that trade unions can negotiate national deals only if the employer agrees.

Trade union rights in practice and Violations in 2007
Background: The first ever nationwide peaceful protest held by the trade union movement on 29 August 2007 in support of demands for a social welfare system, a decent wage and the right to collective bargaining was brutally suppressed by security forces using smoke bombs, tear gas, batons and water canons.
Over 260 demonstrators were arrested.
At the end of June, the Chilean copper giant Codelco faced strike action – marked by episodes of violence – supported by 30,000 subcontracted workers demanding wages and social conditions more in line with those of the permanent staff.
Unfair dismissals, linked to the crisis in the U.S. construction sector, were seen at a number of different forestry operations.
Although a number of reforms have succeeded in eradicating most of the authoritarian aspects of the Constitution introduced by Pinochet in 1990, many anti-union practices remain, including barring union leaders' access to companies, unilateral changes to working hours, the replacement of striking workers, and threats of dismissal to prevent the formation of trade unions.
Abusive practices and labour flexibility at Empresa Cerámicas Cordillera: Constant abusive practices, including unfair dismissals, threats, low wages, non-recognition of work-related illnesses, etc., against the background of a collective agreement favouring labour flexibility, led to strike action, in January, by the 426 workers from the company union in Santiago, to demand an end to the abuses.
BHP Billiton brings in replacement staff to break strike: La Escondida, the largest opencast mine in the world, was operating at 50 per cent capacity with replacement staff substituting the 2,000 workers, who reached day 20 of their strike on 27 August.
BHP Billiton, the Australian energy and mining multinational operating the mine, hired 50 people to support the work of the contract staff supplied to it by private companies.
The union, which was demanding better wages and benefits for its members, rejected the hiring of replacement staff.
The trade union's proposal is linked to the signing of a collective agreement lasting two and a half years.
The company carried out a sustained campaign of pressure and threats on the families of the striking miners and was reported to the Provincial Labour Inspectorate for its anti-union practices.
In November, 25 unions from the Almacenes Paris, Ripley and Falabella department stores met to set up a retail trade union coordinating committee, in order to form a united front for the collective bargaining the holding companies had initiated that month with their workers.
2007 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Cuba
There was no change in Cuba where the single trade union system persists, there is no genuine collective bargaining and the right to strike is not recognised in law.
Independent trade unionists continued to face persecution and seven of the trade unionists sentenced to lengthy prison terms in 2003 remained behind bars.
Humanitarian aid destined for them and their families was confiscated by the authorities.
Another trade unionist arrested in 2004 also stayed in prison.
A single union: The Cuban authorities only recognise a single national trade union centre, the Central de Trabajadores Cubanos (CTC).
The Labour Code, which was published in 1985, does not provide for any genuine freedom of association.
The government explicitly prohibits independent trade unions, though it claims there is no legal requirement for workers to join the CTC.
The government has told the ILO that it is undergoing a comprehensive revision of its Labour Code.
A new code is unlikely to guarantee genuine freedom of association, as the government maintains that existing laws already do so.
According to the Cuban authorities "Freedom of association, protected in Convention 87, does not translate into the false concept of 'trade union pluralism' imposed by the main centres of capitalist and imperial power.
"
Collective bargaining: The Labour Code requires that in order to be valid legally, collective agreements must be discussed and approved in workers' meetings and be formally declared in writing and signed by the parties, i.e.
the employing body as well as the trade union organisation.
Any modifications or additions must be approved in workers' meetings and signed by the parties.
The State controls the employment market and decides on pay and working conditions in the State sector.
In the private sector, the 1995 Foreign Investment Law requires foreign investors to contract workers through State employment agencies.
The investors pay the agencies in dollars, but the agencies pay the workers the equivalent figure in pesos, pocketing up to 95 per cent of their salaries.
There is no legislation covering the right to strike.
According to the government there is no need to call strikes since the demands of official trade union organisations will always be heard by the authorities.
No independent trade union activity possible: Any attempts to form free trade unions are obstructed by the government, chiefly via restrictions set out in the Associations Act.
Anyone who engages in independent trade union activity runs the risk of being persecuted and losing their job.
Workers are required to keep an eye on their colleagues and report any "dissident" activity.
Independent labour activists are periodically arrested, harassed, threatened with prosecution and pressurised into going into exile.
Trade union prisoners: Nine members of the CUTC were sentenced to lengthy prison terms, ranging from 13 to 26 years, in 2003, including Pedro Pablo Alvarez Ramos, the General Secretary.
Two were later released on health grounds, but seven remained in prison throughout 2006.
Carmelo Díaz Fernández, General Secretary of the Christian Trade Union, Unión Sindical Cristiana, and one of the two released because of his ill health, was repeatedly reminded by the authorities that they still considered him a prisoner.
In March 2006 he was prevented from leaving his home all day to attend a commemoration of the March 2003 arrests.
He was again arrested in September and detained for 10 hours, during which time he was refused medication for his serious heart condition.
María Dolores Prado Suárez, a delegate of the light industry workers' union (Sindicato de Trabajadores de la Industria Ligera – SITIL) and education coordinator at the national trade union training centre (Centro Nacional de Capacitación Sindical y Laboral – CNCSL) faced constant threats and harassment during the year, the CONIC reported, including warnings from the local police chief and threats that she would be sent to prison for her activities.
State confiscates aid from independent union: The independent union, the "United Council of Cuban Workers" (Consejo Unitario de Trabajadores Cubanos – CUTC) reported that during the year the government confiscated humanitarian aid sent by foreign trade unions to assist imprisoned CUTC members and their families.
The CUTC offices are regularly raided by the government and its books, documents and computers confiscated.
2007 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Djibouti
The long list of trade union rights violations in the country continued to grow in 2006.
The national trade union centre's mail was intercepted and union leaders were repeatedly harassed and arrested, to the point that one leader had to flee the country in fear of his life.
When they came to investigate the trade union rights situation, representatives of the ILO, the ICFTU and the International Federation of Human Rights (FIDH) were forcibly expelled from the country.
The new Labour Code calls into question fundamental rights: The new Labour Code, which came into force in January 2006, contravenes the fundamental rights upheld by the ILO, including those on freedom of association, collective bargaining and organising.
The social partners were never involved in the drafting work on the Code.
Government authorisation required: Under the new Code, setting up a trade union requires authorisation from the Ministry of the Interior, the Employment Ministry, the Labour Inspectorate, the Ministry of Justice and the Attorney General.
Any change in the statutes or composition of the leadership of a union has to follow the same authorisation procedure.
And should any of the ministries so require, the Attorney General can still refer the application to the civil court to seek the dissolution of the union.
Right to strike limited: While the right to strike is recognised, it is curtailed.
The authorities have broad powers to requisition public servants who are on strike, and unions planning strike action must inform the Ministry of the Interior 48 hours in advance.
The government seriously restricts trade union rights, both in law and in practice.
Unrepresentative organisations: The government has been involved in the establishment of unrepresentative trade union organisations that have usurped the names, titles and roles of the existing union centres.
For international meetings, the authorities have nominated workers' delegates that are in reality closely linked to it and are not representative.
In addition, they have failed to honour the undertakings made during conciliation missions organised by the ILO, the ICFTU and its regional organisation for Africa, AFRO.
In 2006 the authorities expelled ILO and ICFTU representatives from the country.
On 11 March, Adan Mohamed Abdou, General Secretary of the UDT, and Hassan Cher Hared, were arrested, also for "sharing information with a foreign power".
Both men were provisionally released on 29 March, only to be rearrested on 4 April and sent straight to prison without a court order.
The arrests came following the lodging of a complaint by the UDT with the ILO concerning the unfair dismissal and early retirement of 12 trade union leaders and representatives from the Port of Djibouti, including Mohamed Ahmed Mohamed, in September 2005.
The complaint had been intercepted in the post by the intelligence services.
ICFTU, FIDH and ILO representatives expelled: On 4 April Djibouti authorities arrested and expelled an ILO representative tasked with investigating the trade union situation in that country and refused entry to a joint FIDH/ICFTU mission to Djibouti.
Mr Ibrahim Mayaki, the ILO representative, had been on an official visit to Djibouti since Saturday 1 April 2006.
He was interrogated by police and expelled from the country.
The two ICFTU and FIDH representatives were jostled, insulted and forcefully returned to the plane that had brought them to Djibouti.
They had been verbally assured by the Minister of the Interior that there would be no obstacle to obtaining an entry visa at Djibouti airport.
2008 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Ecuador
The violations of trade union rights in sub-contracting and mining companies continued, despite the efforts of the Ministry of Labour and the constant complaints of the unions.
Labour activists and trade unions expect better guarantees on respect for human and workers' rights to result from the work of the Constituent Assembly, as a result of the concrete proposals they had been submitting to the Assembly.
The Constitution and Labour Code provide most workers with the right to form trade unions, with the exception of the police and public sector employees in non-revenue producing areas.
Obstacles to forming a trade union: Public sector workers are only allowed to submit a list of demands for collective bargaining or negotiate a collective agreement if they manage to form an ad hoc committee representing more than half the workforce.
Civil servants and public service workers who are employees or executive staff are subject to the Civil Service and Administrative Careers Act (Ley Orgánica de Servicio Civil y Carrera Administrativa, LOSCA).
Blue-collar workers are subject to the Labour Code.
The former are not allowed to organise in professional associations, trade unions or works' councils, whilst the latter are able to do so, depending on their precise work.
However, only one organisation, the one with the most members, is allowed to fully represent workers in discussions with employers.
This is what is referred to as "single union" status ("sindicato único").
If the workers forming a trade union in an enterprise represent less than 50 per cent of the workforce, workers' councils have to be set up.
To form a workers' council, the approval of 50 per cent plus one of the workforce is required.
If the workers' council has more members than the union, the union will effectively have no power in the workplace.
Right to strike: The right to strike is virtually non-existent in the civil service.
Only workers covered by the Labour Code, with the exceptions foreseen in article 35 of the Constitution, may go on strike.
No collective bargaining for civil servants: Only the workers covered by the Labour Code have the right to take part in collective bargaining.
For workers covered by the 2004 Civil Service and Administrative Careers Act, Article 110 establishes that working conditions shall not be agreed, but imposed.
The same Act effectively prevents the majority of workers in State owned enterprises and any companies in which the State is a majority shareholder, from engaging in collective bargaining.
Teachers are not allowed to negotiate at the local or workplace level, only at the national level.
Trade union rights in practice and Violations in 2007
Following the people's formal approval of the Constituent Assembly, various social organisations including trade union centres began to hold consultations and get involved in the work of the Assembly, which started its operations in November.
The points raised by the union centres included: the elimination of subcontracting and all forms of precarious employment contracts; the elimination of child labour; statutory trade union membership and collective bargaining; full guarantees on workers' organising, grievance and strike rights with no threat of subsequent penalties, and the speedy adoption of a new Labour Code.
Anti-union repression on the banana plantations ... : Attempts to organise workers on Ecuador's banana plantations have met with systematic and severe repression.
Ecuadorian trade unions have constantly denounced the terrible working conditions of the banana plantation workers.
The workers are paid very low wages and are exposed to various chemical substances when working on the plantations during aerial pesticide fumigation.
Child labour is widespread in this sector.
About 98 per cent of workers are employed by sub-contractors, making it easier for employers to avoid their legal obligations.
Subcontracted workers demand the application of their collective agreements: On 14 February around 4,000 members of the Subcontracted Oil Workers' Federation working for Petroecuador in the provinces of Orellana and Sucumbíos began a sit-down strike at the entrances to the oil fields where they work or provide security services.
They were protesting because various companies, including Hulcosur, terminated their contracts in 2006 and had not paid the staff since October.
Five days later the state-owned company promised to transfer funds to Hulcosur so that it could pay the workers their December 2006 wages.
Pacifictel refuses to recognise union delegates: On 3 September, around 30 employees of the state-owned telephone company Pacifictel went on strike in Guayaquil.
The strike was in response to the decision by the management to dismiss 11 employees, two of whom were newly-elected leaders of the works council and refused to give up their posts.
The director did not recognise the election of the new leaders, on the pretext that they were no longer employed by Pacifictel.
It should be stressed that over the last six months, 60 of the 2,000 employees have been sacked, supposedly for reasons of over-capacity.
The sacked workers began a hunger strike on 6 September to demand their reinstatement and the management's recognition of trade union activities.
Projects with incidental amounts of overtime will not incur any significant productivity adjustments.
Projects with extended periods of 50, 60 or more hours per week will incur substantial losses in productivity.
A second and/or third shift will also incur productivity penalties.
To determine any craft rate, whether union or open shop, the estimator starts with the basic wages and fringe benefits.
However, this is just the starting point.
To the wages and fringes, the estimator needs to add what are commonly called payroll burdens.
These burdens are FICA (Social Security), FUI (Federal Unemployment Insurance), SUI (State Unemployment Insurance), WC (Worker Compensation) and others mandated by legislation and/or company operations.
These burdens, plus the base wages and fringe benefits, determine the hourly cost of a craft classification (ex: a Carpenter, Pipefitter, etc.
).
Overtime or the lack of overtime is another consideration in determining the calculation of the hourly rates.
A project that is scheduled for completion using a forty hour work week (watch out for areas that have a standard 35 hour week!
) will have a modest amount, if any, of overtime costs required in the estimate.
A project that is scheduled for extended 50, 60 or even 70 hour work weeks will have a substantial amount included for overtime and loss of productivity.
2007 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Egypt
The right to form and join trade unions is heavily curtailed by law, and workers not belonging to the ETUF are sacked if an employer hears of union activities.
Unions' ability to strike is virtually non-existent, and the government has sequestrated many sectoral organisations.
The engineers were barred from their own general assembly.
The government, with the connivance of the ETUF, took strong measures to prevent the candidates it disapproved of from standing in trade union elections, or from being elected.
Single national centre: The right to form and join trade unions is heavily curtailed in law.
There is a minimum membership requirement of at least 50 employees in the same enterprise, and unions can only operate if they join one of the 23 industrial federations.
All of these have to belong to the only legally recognised trade union centre, the Egyptian Trade Union Federation (ETUF), which has close relations with the NPD, the ruling party.
The ETUF has the power to control the nomination and election procedures for trade union office.
Workers acting outside the scope of the ETUF can be (and are) sacked if the employer learns of their organising activities, as the 2003 labour law makes it legal for an employer to fire someone without giving any reason.
Unions barred from engaging in political activities: Regulations under the Civil Societies and Institutions Law bar national groups registered as civil societies, including trade unions, from being involved in political activities.
This blanket prohibition is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.
Under the 2003 labour law, a collective agreement is only valid if it complies with the law on public order or general ethics.
The ILO Committee of Experts has asked for a definition of "general ethics".
Pentagonal Committees adjudicate disputes: 'Pentagonal committees' made up of government representatives, employers and workers' associations have been set up to adjudicate in labour disputes, and during 2005 they received over 250,000 complaints, and issued verdicts in 10% of the cases.
Unions' ability to strike still virtually non-existent: A limited form of strikes are permitted, but only if two thirds of the ETUF board agrees.
The union must then give a ten-day notice period and indicate the planned duration of the strike.
Unions have the right to strike in "non-strategic" installations, but the Prime Minister determines which these are and can also prevent strikes in strategic sectors, the list of which exceeds the ILO definition of essential services by including, for example, transport and bakeries.
The leader of the doctors' professional trade federation stated that "Egyptian culture has evolved to the point where labour protests are considered an inappropriate means of resistance".
Many irregularities in union elections: The Centre for Trade Union and Workers' Services (CTUWS) reports many irregularities during the country's trade union elections, including withholding certificates of trade union membership, removing candidates' names from lists, threatening trade unionists and forcing workers to tear up candidates' documents to prevent union committees being formed.
Special Economic Zones: The private employers in Egypt's Special Economic Zones show very little respect for labour rights.
Most workers in the Tenth of Ramadan City zone are forced to sign letters of resignation before beginning employment so that they can be fired at the employers' convenience.
Working conditions are very bad, with long hours, low pay and poor safety standards, but it is difficult for labour activists to do anything about it given the restrictions on collective bargaining and the ban on strikes.
Government control over union elections: During October and November, when elections were scheduled for national trade union elections, the government, through the ETUF, took many measures to filter out candidates it considered unsuitable, including members of the Muslim Brotherhood.
Candidates barred from standing for union elections: Mohamed Hafiz Fikry, who works in the Qena Health Administration tried to nominate himself for the trade union branch committee, but was informed that his name did not appear on the state security list of potential candidates.
After he ignored this and registered as a candidate, his name was removed from the list by the Ministry of Manpower.
Mohamed Abu Samra, a member of the Trade Union Committee of the Seaport Authority of Alexandria and Board Member of the General Trade Union of Sea Transport, was deprived of the right to stand again since he had been expelled by the ETUF a month before the elections.
Beaten up for allowing union candidate to register: On 28 October, Rabee Idris, an employee at the Ministry of Manpower's Labour Relations Office was beaten up by detectives from state security and taken to an unknown place because he allowed a trade union member of the Misr Petroleum company to register without his identity card.
2007 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Eritrea
Unions permitted – with some restrictions: Employment law is covered by Proclamation 118, which gives workers the legal right to form unions.
However, government policies restrict free associations.
Unions are not allowed within the armed forces, the police force or other essential services, however civil servants not involved in state administration will be given the right to organise when the draft Civil Service Proclamation is passed.
The Ministry of Labour and Human Welfare must grant special approval for groups of 20 or more persons seeking to form a union, but the government generally does not oppose their formation.
Government monitoring: The national trade union centre is the National Confederation of Eritrean Workers (NCEW), which is closely monitored by the government.
Some trade unions, such as the Teachers Union, Women's Union, Youth Union, and Workers Union, come under close scrutiny from the government and the ruling People's Front for Democracy and Justice party.
Free collective bargaining is thus rendered meaningless.
Fate of arrested union leaders unknown: There was no news of the three trade union leaders arrested in 2005.
Tewelde Ghebremedhin (Chair of the IUF-affiliated Food, Beverages, Hotels, Tourism, Agriculture and Tobacco Workers Federation), Minase Andezion (Secretary of the ITGLWF-affiliated Eritrean Textile, Leather and Shoe Workers' Federation) and Habtom Weldemicael (leader of the Red Sea Bottlers Coca-Cola Workers Union) were arrested in March and April of 2005 and held incommunicado.
Their arrests were thought to be because of their trade union activities (which the government denies) at a time when the government was considering changing trade union regulations and structures.
2009 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Fiji
The provisional government formed following the military coup in 2006 is still in power, but the new labour legislation provides for greater respect of trade union rights.
Freedom of association: Under the Fijian Constitution, workers are entitled to the right of freedom of association.
However, it also provides for the possibility of enacting legislation applying restrictions in the public interest or to protect national security.
Workers have the right to form and join trade unions as well as to organise and bargain collectively.
However, the Registrar retains the discretionary power to refuse to register a union with an inappropriate name or to cancel the registration of a trade union in the cases provided by the law.
The ILO Committee of Experts requested the Fijian government to establish appropriate protective measures to prevent undue interference from the Registrar.
Trade unions now have the right to appeal to the Employment Relations Tribunal against the decisions of the Registrar.
The ERP contains a comprehensive prohibition of acts of anti-union discrimination for all types of trade union activity, at all stages of the employment relationship, including recruitment.
The Employment Relations Tribunal and the Employment Relations Court have the power to order remedies including reinstatement, reimbursement and/or compensation for humiliation, loss of benefit or loss of property.
Collective bargaining: The right to collective bargaining is also enshrined in the Fijian Constitution.
In addition, the ERP promotes and encourages collective bargaining.
It sets a requirement of good faith on the part of both the union and the employer when negotiating a collective agreement.
The right to strike: The right to strike is recognised for all matters except those relating to trade union recognition.
Under the ERP, the conditions governing the right to strike remain unchanged in relation to previous legislation, and unions are required to give 21 days' notice to the Registrar of Trade Unions (who reports to the Minister of Labour) before putting a strike to the ballot.
The strike is allowed if more than 50 per cent of the paid-up members vote in favour.
This applies to all unions, in both "essential" and "non-essential" industries.
With respect to "essential" industries, however, a further 28 days' notice must be given to the Registrar, and organisers must provide the Ministry of Labour with information concerning the date, time and location of the strike, together with a list of participants.
The requirement that more than 50 per cent of the paid-up members vote in favour of the strike is too restrictive and is a substantial obstacle to the exercise of the right to strike.
The ILO Committee of Experts requested the government to modify this requirement so that only the votes cast in the strike ballot need to be taken into account.
The list of "essential" industries has been reduced and is now broadly in line with the terms of ILO Convention 87.
The Minister of Labour has the right to declare existing or proposed strikes unlawful.
If s/he does so, the dispute is referred to a Permanent Arbitrator and workers are obliged to return to the workplace.
This power effectively enables the government to restrict the exercise of the right to strike.
Trade unionists can face criminal charges and risk imprisonment if they persist with strike action.
There is no adequate judicial protection to prevent abuses and the imposition of disproportionate penalties on trade unionists.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2008
Background: Commodore Frank Bainimarama is running a civilian government with no democratic legitimacy, resulting from a coup d'état.
Elections have not been planned yet and there has been a huge outcry from civil society and international organisations regarding the delay.
Press freedom is still restricted.
The Fiji Trades Union Congress worked with some employers during the year on establishing an effective wage mechanism to cover unorganised and informal economy workers earning poverty wages, but these efforts were hampered.
The political situation in the country and the international economic turmoil strained trade union efforts to tackle labour issues in 2008.
The Fiji Trades Union Congress (FTUC) continued its public efforts to re-establish democracy.
2009 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Ethiopia
Freedom of association – many categories of workers are excluded: The Constitution recognises the right to form and join trade unions, but much of the current labour legislation is based on the 2003 Labour Proclamation, which excludes many categories of workers in the public sector, including judges, prosecutors, educators and security service workers, as well as others in the non-profit sector or in managerial posts.
Union monopoly cancelled, but arbitrary dissolution still possible: Multiple unions are allowed in the same enterprise, and ten is the minimum number required to form a union.
All trade unions have to be registered, and the government can apply to the courts to cancel union registration if the union has engaged in prohibited activities, such as political action.
No legal protection against employer interference in trade unions: The law does not prevent an employer from creating or supporting a workers' organisation with a view to controlling it.
Limitations on collective bargaining: The government issued a regulation in 2006 whereby if negotiations aimed at amending or replacing a collective agreement are not finished three months after its expiry, the provisions on wages and other benefits cease to apply.
Public servants are not allowed to negotiate for better wages or working conditions.
The government had told the ILO it is studying other countries' legislation with a view to drafting a Labour Code giving civil servants, including teachers in the public sector, the right to bargain collectively.
Limitations on the right to strike: Trade unions can be dissolved if they carry out strikes in 'essential' services, but the list exceeds the ILO definition, by including air transport and urban bus services.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2008
Government interference: The government blatantly interferes in trade union affairs in all sectors.
Many trade union leaders are regularly intimidated, and most are removed from their posts and/or forced to leave the country, whilst others have been detained without trial.
The government closely monitors the Confederation of Ethiopian Trade Unions (CETU).
Suspensions and dismissals of trade unionists, creation of yellow unions: At the two-yearly CETU congress at the end of September, the ten affiliate trade union federations denounced the rising number of violations of workers' rights and of those of their trade union representatives, who are facing "serious problems" in several companies.
For example, management of Bole Printing Enterprise suspended 10 of its 400 workers, including three trade union leaders.
Their salaries were also suspended.
Two other companies in the food sector, the Cheraliya biscuit factory and the Dashen brewery, were also named by the CETU for similar problems and for employer pressure on trade unions.
According to the CETU, several company managements have not hesitated to promote the creation of unions favourable to them or to dismiss trade union militants.
Dissolution of the Ethiopian Teachers' Association: Following legal proceedings begun 15 years ago, the Supreme Court upheld on 26 June the decisions of the Federal High Court of 21 June and of the Federal Supreme Court of 7 February requiring the ETA to transfer all its assets and its name – the key to its identity – to a rival teachers' association created in 1993 and supported by the government.
On 28 July, a representative of the new ETA displayed the court ruling on the wall of the trade union organisation.
This decision follows years of harassment and intimidation of the organisation and its members, the murder of ETA deputy secretary-general Assefa Maru, the six years of imprisonment of the former chairman Taye Woldesmiate, and the imprisonment and torture of many ETA militants and their families.
All the pressure brought to bear by the international trade union movement and the ILO Conference Committee on the Application of Standards has proved in vain.
In February, a delegation from Education International was not even able to meet government representatives.
Following this irrevocable court decision, ETA militants set up a new trade union association, the National Teachers Association (NTA), lodging in July 2008 an application to register with the Ministry of Justice.
On 15 December, the Ministry of Justice officially communicated to the NTA its refusal of the registration.
2009 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Gabon
Right to join trade unions: All workers have the right freely to form and become members of the trade union of their choice.
Trade unions must be registered to obtain official recognition.
Right to strike – limitations: Workers in the public sector can join a trade union and have the right to strike, however that right is restricted where it poses a threat to public safety.
Discrimination against trade unions: The law does not expressly prohibit discrimination against trade unions.
However, the courts can order employers that are found guilty of discrimination to compensate the employees concerned.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2008
Widespread anti-union harassment: Trade unionists in both the public and private sectors are often discriminated against.
They are regularly harassed or simply dismissed.
Many members of the Gabonese Confederation of Trade Unions (CGSL) have been victims in recent years of arbitrary arrests and even of imprisonment on trumped-up charges.
The government also ignores the elected leadership of the CGSL, appointing workers' representatives of its own choosing to tripartite bodies.
Western University offers part-time, full-time, and temporary employment opportunities to meet a variety of staffing requirements and accommodate employee needs and preferences.
All new positions are classified as part of Western University's job requisition process.
Employees' jobs also are reviewed for reclassification any time their weekly working hours or job descriptions are modified.
The Office of Human Resources is responsible for informing new hires of their:
2009 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Germany
A European Court of Justice (ECJ) judgment again effectively ignored international law.
Civil servants, irrespective of their function, are still deprived of the right to strike.
Different forms of employers' anti-union behaviour were reported.
The Basic Law recognises the right to bargain collectively, and agreements are governed by the Act on Collective Agreements.
Collective agreements are binding for members of the trade union and employers' association concerned.
There is a rule limiting collective agreements to work-related issues, not to business decisions, which creates a lot of "grey area" of what can or cannot be a subject of collective bargaining.
Consultation and information rights: Workers are able to participate directly in management decision-making through works' councils, which are responsible for supervising the implementation of the union's collective agreement in a workplace.
Workers' consultation and information rights are in line with European Union legislation.
Members of works' councils do not have to be union representatives, although more than half are union members according to figures from 2006.
No right to strike for civil servants: Civil servants in public services, including teachers, are denied the right to strike.
Since 1959, the ILO has been asking the government to grant the right to strike to civil servants that do not exercise authority in the name of the state.
Similarly, despite ILO criticism, employees with civil servant status are still denied collective bargaining rights.
Employees in public services who are covered by collective agreements do, however, enjoy full freedom of association.
Some civil servants' and professional organisations, unlike the member unions of the DGB, are still opposed to the right to strike for civil servants, so as to avoid risking the loss of their acquired "privileges" (such as the state's obligation to support them financially and their protection against dismissal, etc.
).
The trade unions were closely involved in a comprehensive modernisation of the legislation governing the civil service under the Schröder Social Democrat administration (until 2005), and it was hoped that this would take ILO recommendations into account.
No progress has been made since the "Grand Coalition" government came to power in November 2005, however.
Protest and solidarity strikes: Strikes and lock-outs are not regulated by law, but follow the jurisprudence of the Federal Labour Court (BAG).
To date, there has been a general understanding that only strikes relating to the conclusion of a collective agreement are legal.
The BAG decisions in 2007 challenged this view, however.
On 24 April 2007, the BAG ruled that trade unions are also allowed to call protest strikes concerning issues such as closure of plants.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2008
ECJ rulings undermine workers' rights: In 2008, the "Rüffert" Judgment annulled, in practice, the "Tariftreueregelungen" in the Federal states.
These "Tariftreueregelungen" are provisions under public procurement law, which stipulate that public tenders can only be awarded to companies that pay standard wages.
The ECJ ruled that public tenders could only prescribe terms and conditions established through statutory legal minimum wages or generally applicable collective agreements.
In Germany this has meant that posted workers have a lower level of protection.
The Rüffert Judgment is one of a series of legal rulings (with Viking, Laval, and the Commission versus Luxembourg) that have interpreted the "Posting Directive" as establishing maximum conditions, with no higher level of protection being allowed than that provided in the Directive, whilst companies' economic freedom has been given primacy over workers' rights.
Collective bargaining: Germany has a long tradition of collective bargaining.
However, in many sectors exemption clauses have been agreed between the social partners that allow companies to undercut collective agreements in certain circumstances in order to safeguard employment.
Wherever concessions were made on wages, employment guarantees were provided in return.
Collective agreements signed by yellow unions, with few members and low representativeness, are increasingly been recognised in courts.
A particular problem is presented by collective agreements signed by Christian trade unions, which have often settled for indecently low wages.
Discrimination against trade union members: There is no systematic discrimination by the state in Germany; however, there have been repeated cases of anti-union discrimination by employers.
For instance, prominent trade union members are targeted and dismissals, demotions, transfers and discrimination in recruitment occur, especially when trade union activists are also members of the works' councils.
Court cases to oppose such forms of discrimination, which sometimes seriously threaten trade unionists' financial situation, can often be long and painful processes.
Anti-union employers: Regardless of a rich tradition of trade unionism, collective bargaining and workplace representation, there are plenty of companies that are quite hostile to trade unions.
In these cases, external trade union representatives, for instance, are not granted access to the workplace and employers engage in anti-union propaganda.
Employers can avoid workers' representatives by dividing companies into smaller units.
There is no minimum membership requirement for a trade union, but at least five workers are needed to form a works' council, so, by creating very small organisational units, employers can diminish union presence indirectly.
Media attacks on works' councils to undermine trade unions are a well-known tactic: management can be quite manipulative of public opinion, for example, by exaggerating the overheads of a works' council.
Anti-union harassment intensifies during strikes and trade union protests; there were cases where the police were called in to "discipline" trade unionists, thus siding with the employer and undermining the principle of state neutrality.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Ghana
Four workers were arrested and several wounded by rubber bullets when they were forcibly removed from their steel plant for starting a strike.
The labour legislation does not sufficiently secure trade union rights, and the authorities retain some discretionary powers over unions.
Although the Labour Act has been brought more into line with international labour standards, problematic areas remain.
For starters, the Emergency Powers Act 1994 is still in force, and grants the authorities extensive powers to suspend any law and prohibit public meetings and processions.
Many categories of workers are also excluded from the Labour Act, including managerial workers, the definition of whom is very broad.
If there are multiple unions at a workplace, the "chief labour officer" has discretionary powers to decide which union will be awarded the collective bargaining "certificate" needed to negotiate with the employer.
Albeit the right to strike is guaranteed in the Labour Act, it can be limited in private enterprises if the workers' services are deemed essential to the enterprise's survival, and in essential services, which includes many sectors that fall outside the ILO definition.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Employers use court decision to undermine trade union rights: Although freedom of association is protected in law, in practice this is undermined by a 2008 decision of the Accra High Court concerning Ghana Telecommunications Limited (GT) to the effect that employers could hire and fire without giving any reasons for the termination of employment.
Mr Kofi Asamoah, secretary general of the GTUC, warned at the 2009 May Day rally that some employers were using the ruling to get rid of so-called troublesome workers and unionists.
Strikers assaulted and arrested during lock out: Over 600 workers of the Western Steel and Forging Limited at Kpone, near Tema, were locked out as management shut down the company indefinitely, after the workers embarked on strike on 6 May.
The workers had been negotiating grievances with management, but began the strike when there was no response to their demands.
These included the dismissal of Mr Kyeremeh Kofi Awuah, the company's human resource manager, who had ignored health and safety issues, leading to accidents.
Grievances also concerned payment disparities and overtime payments that were not calculated in accordance with the collective agreement.
One of the workers' leaders, Mr Michael Koompon, claimed that the police forcefully removed the workers from the company premises and that four of the workers were arrested for no cause while several others were assaulted and wounded with rubber bullets.
2009 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Ghana
Several trade union leaders were dismissed.
Labour law insufficiently guarantees the freedom of association.
The list of essential services that was officially decided in 2007 is too long and restricts the right to strike even further.
There was anti-union discrimination in the banking and insurance sector.
Rights protected: Article 21 of the Constitution of Ghana recognises the right of all persons to freedom of speech and expression, freedom of association, including forming and joining trade unions or other associations for the protection of their interest, and freedom of assembly.
Section 79(29) of the Labour Act excludes workers from the right to join a trade union, where their function is considered as: (a) policy-making, (b) decision-making, (c) managerial, (d) holding a position of trust, (e) performing duties that are of a highly confidential nature or (f) being an agent of a shareholder of an undertaking.
The exclusion of managerial and supervisory staff is only compatible with C.87 if the workers concerned have a right to establish their own associations.
Restricted right to strike: The law recognises the right to strike, with limitations.
All disputes have to be referred to the National Labour Commission (NLC), which is an arbitration body composed of government, union and employers' representatives.
Strikes are seen as a last resort, where arbitration is unsuccessful, and unions must give seven days' notice.
During the year the government drew up a list of essential services, which includes many sectors (such as fuel distribution and public transport) that should not be regarded as essential services based on the ILO definition.
In addition, limitations can be imposed on the right to strike for workers in a private enterprise if their services are deemed essential to the enterprise's survival.
Risk of bias in recognition of trade unions for collective bargaining purposes: The 2004 Labour Act makes the "chief labour officer" responsible for designating the most representative trade union, which will be authorised to negotiate with the employer, through giving the union a collective bargaining "certificate".
That official decides which union should be awarded the certificate where there is more than one union in the company.
The ILO maintains that the chief labour officer has totally discretionary powers and that the criteria on which the decision is based are not clear.
Any system requiring mandatory recognition should also apply objective criteria so as to avoid any risk of bias or abuse, but this is not the case.
There is no minimum statutory length of time for a collective agreement to last.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2008
Background: John Atta-Mills won the December presidential elections.
The Ghana Employers' Association (GEA) and the trade union confederations have since called for a revision of labour law on the basis that certain texts are overly ambiguous and do not promote social peace.
The sections involved directly concern the right of association (setting up trade unions and collective bargaining), but the calls for revision also target certain legal texts that allow employers to dismiss their workers for no stated reason.
Persistent violations in export processing zones (EPZ): Even though the Labour Act (Act 2003/651) protects trade union members and their officers against discrimination if they organise within the free zones, in practice some employers have persistently resisted unionisation of the employees.
Anti-union discrimination: The banking and insurance sector saw a large number of dismissals of trade union activists.
In January, five leaders of the Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union (ICU) and three other employees were dismissed at Barclays Bank Ghana Limited.
The ICU denounced what it saw as a manoeuvre by the employer to pressure workers in order to achieve a favourable (for it) outcome of negotiations for the renewal of the collective agreement.
At the end of June, following threats of sanctions against strikers by the employer, the Bank of Ghana dismissed two employees, Benjamin Duffour and Frank Mensah of the Bank of Ghana Senior Staff Association, leading to a work stoppage by their colleagues.
In this case, once again, the two workers' trade union activity was very clearly the principal reason for their dismissal.
The ProCredit company in turn dismissed just as summarily the Vice-President of the union affiliated to the Union of Industry, Commerce and Finance Workers (UNICOF) after doing everything possible, since 2005, to slow down discussions on the collective agreement, including promoting the introduction of a yellow union.
Trade union leader dismissed in the mining sector: At the beginning of 2008, Kweku Shaibu, Chair of the local branch of the Ghana Mineworkers Union (GMU), was dismissed by the management of Newmont Ghana Limited for questioning his employer's decision to withdraw the 4 a.m. coffee break.
In a press release, the GMU denounced this "ruthless, vindictive and unfair" decision, together with the general deterioration of the social climate, with workers accusing management of discrimination, in particular against pregnant workers, and complaining of racist comments by an expatriate.
2009 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Georgia
The ultra-liberal Labour Code gives green light to union busting and the marginalisation of collective bargaining.
The courts do not apply laws prohibiting anti-union discrimination.
Important restrictions on trade union rights remain in place.
At least 30 workers, many of them women, lost jobs in connection with their trade union activities.
Freedom of association: The Constitution and the 1997 Law on Trade Unions recognise basic trade union rights.
Public servants, except for certain categories employed in law enforcement agencies and prosecutors' offices, have the right to form and join trade unions.
Limitations: At least 100 people are needed for a trade union to be established – a requirement considered unreasonable by the ILO Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
An enterprise-level section of an existing trade union can be formed if at least 15 workers wish to do so.
The Organic Law on the Suspension and Prohibition of Activities of Voluntary Associations allows suspending a trade union by a court decision for reasons such as causing a social conflict.
According to Article 37 (d), an employer can dismiss a worker without any reason whatsoever, provided that compensation equivalent to the worker's one-month salary would be paid.
While anti-union discrimination is prohibited both by the Labour Code and the Penal Code there are no specific provisions to prevent dismissal related to trade union membership or activities.
Article 37 (d) has been used to suppress trade unions as well as those who oppose workplace discrimination or simply take a stand for workers' rights.
The Supreme Court ruled that employers' discretionary right to dismiss a worker should not be deemed discriminatory and that the Labour Code of 2006 took precedence over the 1997 Law on Trade Unions.
In 2008 the Government held consultations with the ILO and agreed to an independent and impartial assessment of the labour legislation and its implications.
Moreover, on 16 December after several consultations, the government, the Georgian Trade Union Confederation (GTUC, affiliated to the ITUC) and the Employers' Association signed a Tripartite Agreement that could be instrumental to bringing the national legislation into line with international labour standards and expanding cooperation with the ILO.
Collective bargaining: The above-mentioned Labour Code defines collective agreement as an agreement between an employer and two or more employees or a trade union.
Employers are not obliged to engage in collective bargaining, even if a trade union or a group of employees wishes to do so.
Contrary to the international labour standards, an employer can bypass a functioning trade union organisation and conclude a collective agreement with non-unionised workers instead.
The code also gives employers the right to unilaterally establish the rules concerning a number of working conditions traditionally subject to collective bargaining.
Right to strike: Definition of a labour dispute under Article 49(1) of the Labour Code can be interpreted as allowing strikes only in case of conflicts of rights, not conflicts of interests.
A strike, regardless of the nature of work or sector of activity, cannot exceed 90 days in a row and is only legal if a warning strike of no longer than three days has taken place one to fourteen days before the main strike.
Workers who were notified of the termination of their employment before the dispute has started cannot go on strike.
Violations of these restrictive rules can in some cases cost the organisers up to two years in prison.
The right to solidarity strike is not guaranteed.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2008
Background: Numerous social and human rights concerns were put on the backburner because of a full-blown military conflict between Georgia and Russia in August, which resulted in a massive loss of lives, homes and jobs.
The bombings in Poti Port took the lives of 10 trade union members.
The international trade union movement called for a complete ceasefire and offered aid to the stricken areas.
Even though protective measures for trade union representatives under the Trade Union Law are theoretically still valid, the courts simply ignore those provisions in favour of the Labour Code.
The GTUC reported reports numerous decisions where the Law on Trade Unions was simply ignored.
New law hits trade unions hard: More than 30 workers lost their jobs because of their trade union activities.
Many others are afraid to loose the jobs and the GTUC estimates that they had lost around 20 000 members owing to the harassment and dismissals facilitated by the new Labour Code.
Update on union busting in the Port of Poti: The town of Poti on the Black Sea gained international notoriety for the blatant anti-unionism in its port.
The Dockers and Seafarers' Union of Georgia challenged the dismissals of trade union activists in the Poti city court, quoting the ILO conventions in the hope that the court would rectify blatant anti-union discrimination.
On 21 March, Poti city court rejected the lawsuit and then the trade union also lost its appeal to the Kutaisi city court.
The court of appeal did not make any reference to ILO Convention 98, but motivated its decision on the grounds that the Labour Code has precedence over the Trade Union Act.
The dismissed activists remained unemployed at the time of writing.
Nine activists dismissed from BTM Textile: On 16 March, 250 workers officially established a trade union and joined the GTUC Adjara branch at the company BTM Textile in Khelvachauri district of the Autonomous Republic of Adjara, which employs 500 women workers.
Nine women were elected onto the union committee.
The GTUC Adjara branch representative informed the employer about the new union on 10 April.
The very next day all nine committee members were dismissed without any explanation.
The remaining trade union members were threatened with dismissal, unless trade union activities at the company stopped.
The trade unionists met with no success when trying to seek help from the municipal administration.
The administration even agreed with the company's decision.
The GTUC Adjara branch has challenged the dismissals in court.
Yellow trade union formed in the education sector: Since the adoption of the Labour Code, the Ministry of Education and Science has been reluctant to engage in collective bargaining with the representative Educators' and Scientists' Free Trade Union of Georgia (ESFTUG).
At the beginning of the year, all school directors and chairs of the boards of the public schools of the district of Bolnisi were invited to a meeting to be introduced to the new Professional Education Syndicate (PES).
Registered in January, PES was founded by school directors, trainers from the government-controlled teacher training centres and a high official of the Ministry of Education.
The school directors were invited to encourage their employees to switch their current trade union affiliation to the PES.
A 50% refund was offered as an incentive on the fees for training for the teachers' certificate, and the latter was even offered free of charge in the Autonomous Republic of Adjara.
While the teachers' certificate is not compulsory, it is strongly recommended to have one.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Guinea
Trade union activities were banned by the ruling junta until 28 February.
Further to the massacre by the army on 28 September, the trade unions, like the rest of the population, witnessed a further cycle of violence and impunity.
They organised a two day national strike in protest.
Freedom of association is guaranteed by law, however several restrictions apply.
The Labour Code allows all workers, except military and paramilitary personnel, the right to form and join trade unions.
However, unions are vulnerable to employer interference, as the law does not provide for adequate measures to prevent anti-union discrimination.
Furthermore, although the Constitution secures the right to strike, employers can impose binding arbitration, and strikes are prohibited in essential services.
In addition, the latter are broadly defined to also include transport, radio and television, and communications, which do not fall under the ILO definition of essential services.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Trade unions denounce abuses at RUSAL: At a workshop organised in April by the International Federation of Chemical, Energy, Mine and General Workers' Unions (ICEM), mineworkers backed by their unions provided evidence on the extremely poor working conditions at the Kindla Bauxite Company, a subsidiary of the mining giant RUSAL.
A culture of outsourcing at the mine, introduced by management with the complicity of associates of former President Lansana Conté, weakened the trade unions and aggravated the poverty of workers and their families and the local population.
Several of Kindla's 120 outsourcing companies used child labour.
The ruling junta has promised trade unions that it will accelerate the review of the national mining convention, a code outrageously biased in favour of foreign investors.
RUSAL's industrial relations manager was expelled from the country.
Trade union activities banned: On 28 February, the National Council for Democracy and Development (CNDD) lifted the ban that had prevented all trade union and political activity since the coup d'état on 23 December 2008.
Three days later, troops under the command of the Secretary of State for the Fight Against Drugs raided the home of Rabiatou Sérah Diallo, general secretary of the National Workers Confederation of Guinea (CNTG).
The trade union leader, who has often been harassed and threatened with death in recent times, described it as another act of intimidation.
The European Parliament yesterday (22 October) approved legislation granting temporary workers equal rights in terms of working hours, salary and holidays, ending a six-year legislative battle.
Businesses and trade unions alike welcomed the deal, which they said struck the right balance between social and economic needs.
In May 2008, the British government eventually reached an agreement with social partners to support the directive, given that the UK would be granted an opt-out on applying equal treatment after just 12 weeks on the job ( EurActiv 21/05/08 ).
This agreement cleared the way for its adoption by the bloc's employment ministers in June ( EurActiv 10/06/08 ).
The Parliament's employment committee backed the text on 7 October ( EurActiv 08/10/08 ), sending the draft to plenary without further amendments.
Following successful lobbying by the UK and other governments, national derogations allowing employers to treat agency workers differently until they have been on the job for more than 12 weeks will be permitted, provided there is agreement between social partners.
But the amended directive makes clear that such practices should remain the exception.
The new legislation, which was welcomed by all social partners and MEPs across the political spectrum, will also grant the three million or so agency workers across the EU equal access to employment and vocational training as well as childcare facilities.
"This is a victory for the European Parliament and for the social partners.
It's a strong signal which shows that a social Europe can move forward," said French Socialist MEP Harlem Désir, commenting on the plenary vote.
But he also considered it a victory for his party, claiming that member states had taken up 85% of the text proposed by Socialist rapporteur Ike van den Burg.
John Monks of the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) described the vote as "a very welcome signal that the deadlock in the development of social Europe is broken and that social progress at EU level is both necessary and possible".
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Haiti
The foundation for exercising trade union rights remains porous, as employers enjoy great freedom in countering union organising attempts.
Labour dispute resolution remains ineffective, and sanctions for violating the labour legislation are lacking.
Many categories of workers enjoy limited or no freedom of association, and the right to strike is excessively restricted.
Despite promises of reform, trade union rights are not adequately secured in law.
While the Constitution provides for freedom of association, the Labour Code excludes many categories of workers from its scope.
Any association comprising more than 20 people must also receive prior authorisation from the government in order to be recognised.
Civil servants and agricultural workers are not covered by the Labour Code, and foreign workers are not allowed to hold union leadership posts.
While the law bans anti-union dismissals, it does not provide for reinstatement.
Furthermore, the right to collective bargaining is not guaranteed as employers are not obliged to meet or negotiate with trade unions.
The authorities also have the power to intervene in the drafting of collective agreements.
In addition, the parties to a collective dispute must try to resolve their differences by using mediation, conciliation and arbitration, and it is a tripartite consultation committee that gives the final ruling on a dispute.
Although the right to strike is provided for in the Constitution, no strike may exceed one day.
The Law also defines three types of strikes and any action that does not fit one if those definitions is considered illegal.
Finally, strikes are illegal in public sector enterprises.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Dispute resolution virtually non-existent: The institutions set up to resolve labour disputes are completely dysfunctional.
The Tripartite Committee responsible for mediating and arbitrating disputes has been a failure, since the cases submitted to it are never resolved.
The industrial tribunals system is also defective, since trials are rarely fair, judges are poorly trained and deadlines are not respected.
Using a lawyer is often prohibitively expensive, resulting in the workers hardly ever using the industrial tribunals.
When the tribunals do pronounce in favour of the workers, their rulings are not implemented.
Labour inspectorates ineffective: Charged with enforcing legislation, labour inspectorates are often short-staffed, poorly equipped and badly trained, or even directly threatened by employers.
2007 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Haiti
Haiti's difficult political and economic situation continued to provide an excuse for little to be done to ensure the respect of trade union rights, which have little protection in law.
Despite the stated desire of the new government to harmonise legislation with the ILO's fundamental standards, no steps had been taken to that effect by the end of the year.
Restrictive labour code: The 1987 Constitution provides for freedom of association and the right to strike in all sectors.
The Labour Code, which mainly covers the private sector, dates back to the Duvalier dictatorship and is very restrictive.
It excludes many categories of workers, such as domestic employees and miners from its coverage, and prevents foreign workers from holding trade union leadership posts.
Collective bargaining: The Labour Code does not oblige employers to meet or negotiate with trade union organisations.
A decree dating back to 4 November 1983 allows the Department for Labour and Social Welfare the authority to intervene in the drafting of collective agreements.
In practice, it is not possible to appeal against the Committee's rulings.
Several labour lawyers have pointed out the dangerous effects of these arrangements.
They argue the creation of a new jurisdiction "outside" the legal system increases the chances of contradictions between the law and the judicial role played by the Committee, in resolving labour disputes.
The law also provides for the existence of an industrial tribunal, the task of which is supposed to be to resolve conflicts resulting from violations of provisions in the Labour Code.
However, the tribunal is not competent to rule on labour disputes arising in the public sector.
Restriction on the right to strike: The right to strike is recognised by the Labour Code, but with restrictions.
The Code defines three types of strike.
Any strike that does not fit one of those definitions is considered illegal.
Once a strike has been deemed illegal, the workers may be sacked for breaking their contracts – after three days' absence.
The parties in a dispute must take steps towards conciliation prior to calling a strike.
A 48 hour notice period is compulsory and strikes may not exceed one day.
Promise by the new government: For several years now consideration has been given to reforming Haitian legislation in line with ILO standards on trade union rights.
In March the newly-elected government undertook to take the measures needed to protect workers against any form of anti-union discrimination and any form of interference in trade unions' internal affairs.
It promised to make provisions for promoting the development of the widest possible use of voluntary bargaining procedures and to amend the legal measures that allow the government powers to control trade unions, impose compulsory arbitration at the request of only one of the parties to a dispute and exclude a whole series of workers from the scope of application of the labour code.
However, by the end of the year none of those promises had been acted on.
Employers abuse rights: In practice, the right to organise and collective bargaining are virtually non-existent.
As a result of political chaos, a climate of violence, record unemployment rate and the complicity of a weak State, employers have enjoyed absolute freedom.
In most cases, employers set wages unilaterally.
Working conditions are generally disgraceful and do not meet sanitary and safety standards.
On the pretext that Haitians are willing to work at any price, employers regularly behave abusively by making general reductions in wages and even ignoring the minimum wage enshrined in national legislation.
Many workers are employed without contracts and are unaware of the existence of the Labour Code.
Occasionally, workers do not even know the name of the company they are working for and so are unable to protect their rights.
As a result, those people trying to organise workers in a union are constantly harassed or dismissed, generally in breach of labour legislation.
To prevent workers from joining unions, employers give bonuses to those who are not union members.
Failings of governments: Successive governments have taken no concrete measures to enforce the law.
The Minister of Justice and Public Security under the Aristide administration even told representatives of an international trade union mission that visited Haiti in February 2005, that teachers and journalists in Haiti "should not be allowed" to join trade unions.
Corruption within the administration has continued to constitute a barrier for trade unionists when attempting to get their organisations registered.
Ineffective labour inspectorates: The labour inspectorates, charged with enforcing legislation, are often short-staffed, poorly equipped and badly trained, or even directly threatened by employers.
A report by the American Center for International Labor Solidarity (ACILS/AFL-CIO) in 2003, showed that inspectors often fail to understand their role and enforce their authority.
An inadequate budget is a problem, together with a lack of political will on the part of successive governments.
Right to strike restricted: As the law makes it virtually impossible to hold strikes legally, workers often hesitate to exercise this right, particularly owing to the required notice period.
Nevertheless, despite the ban against their doing so, public service workers have exercised the right to strike.
Industrial zones and export processing zones: The CODEVI (Industrial Development Company) free trade zone was set up in Ouanaminthe, on the border with the Dominican Republic, under the management of the clothing group Grupo M in August 2003.
The company, based in the Dominican Republic, built the plant using a $20 million loan from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) – the World Bank's private sector lending arm.
The loan was conditional on the company's respect for freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining.
However, workers' rights were regularly abused and attempts to form a union met with dismissals, including the mass dismissal of 350 workers in June 2004.
That situation now appears to have changed.
Further to a national and international campaign, the workers have been reinstated, the union has been recognised and a collective agreement was signed at the end of 2005.
The five industrial parks in and around the Haitian capital strongly resemble the majority of EPZs in the Americas in terms of trade union rights.
The only real difference is their name and the fact that they offer investors few fiscal incentives.
Trade unions are not welcome and organisers face intimidation.
International Finance Corporation: international agreement on respect of trade union rights achieved by Haitian pilot project in the Ouanaminthe EPZ: On 21 February 2006, the International Finance Corporation, the branch of the World Bank responsible for making loans to the private sector, adopted a rule whereby the granting of loans was made conditional on performance in terms of labour rights and working conditions, thereby forcing companies to comply with international labour standards, preventing any use of forced labour, child labour or discriminatory practices, and requiring respect of all trade union rights.
That regulation was based on a proposal by the ICFTU to make a loan to the Dominican textile company Grupo M, for setting up a production unit in the Ouanaminthe EPZ, conditional on the company's respect of fundamental labour standards.
Following several months of collective action, the regulation helped lead to the signing in December 2005 by the union SOKOWA and the CODEVI factory of a first, historic collective agreement providing for wage increases and improvements in working conditions.
Refusal to reinstate a union treasurer fired by brewery: Although the dismissal of Semeran Philome, the trade union treasurer of the union at the "La Couronne" brewery who had been sacked at the end of 2005 for alleged assault of a worker, was deemed illegal by the Social Affairs Ministry, the management had taken no steps to reinstate him by the end of 2006.
At a meeting with the leaders of the trade union federation Premier Mai Batay Ouvriye, the employers stated that the international solidarity campaign led by Batay Ouvriye had spoilt the chances of the union treasurer being reinstated.
Interference in the union elections of SOKOWA coupled with threats: Following an internal conflict in the union SOKOWA based on the results of the union elections held in April, the management of the CODEVI factory refused to recognise the outgoing executive committee, preferring to support a minority group.
As the employers chose not to negotiate with the legitimate representatives, working conditions worsened and many workers were sacked.
Thanks to the intervention of the Social Affairs Ministry in May, an agreement was reached between the trade union factions, however the management continued to refuse to meet the members of the executive committee and threatened to sack them all.
In June, following a stoppage by the workforce, the management threatened to close down the factory and to sack the 700 employees, repeatedly blaming all the problems on Batay Ouvriye.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Honduras
On 28 June, a coup d'état broke with the legal and social stability in Honduras.
The post-coup violence claimed the lives of at least 12 trade unionists.
The main targets of the repression were the members of the National Resistance Front against the Coup, which groups trade union centres and numerous civil society organisations, including women's and youth groups.
Numerous restrictions apply to trade union rights despite initial guarantees.
The law recognises the right to form and join trade unions.
However, at least 30 workers are required to create a union, and there can only be one union in any given establishment.
Foreigners enjoy limited freedom of association as they can not be elected to union leadership positions, and the law requires that 90% of a union's members must be Honduran nationals.
While the law awards some protection to workers trying to form a union and to the union's leadership, the provisions are lacking especially concerning anti-union discrimination and dismissal.
The right to collective bargaining is recognised, but the Labour Code restricts the themes that can be included in bargaining.
In addition, public employees are not allowed to conclude collective agreements, and collective disputes even in non-essential public services are subject to compulsory arbitration.
The right to strike is also coupled with restrictions, and an inordinate two-thirds of the votes of the total union membership is required to call a strike.
Federations and confederations may not call a strike.
Public employees may not take part in solidarity strikes, and employees of state-owned enterprises must give six month's notice or obtain government approval before striking.
Finally, the authorities have the power to end disputes in certain services.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Background: On 28 June, constitutional President Manuel Zelaya was ousted by a coup d'état and replaced by Roberto Micheletti as the de facto leader of Honduras.
The new government was not recognised by any country or international institution.
In addition to the 20 people killed (including 12 trade unionists), over 500 were injured and some 3,000 were arrested in the repression that followed the coup.
Coup opponents also faced countless human rights violations, extrajudicial executions, forced disappearances, arbitrary arrests, death threats, physical attacks and widespread intimidation.
The main targets of the attacks were the National Resistance Front against the Coup, a movement defending democracy and the rule of law grouping trade union centres, civil society organisations, women's and youth groups.
Press and radio stations supporting the legitimate government were raided and closed down; numerous journalists were physically and mentally tortured.
The global economic crisis has also had a serious impact on Honduras and 20,000 job losses were registered over the year.
Union-busting strategies: Despite the legal recognition of trade union immunity protecting union representatives against unfair dismissal, the main strategy still being employed by companies to destroy unions is to fire all their leaders, often at the very moment the union is founded, to prevent its consolidation and growth.
As the reinstatement procedure is very slow, those affected ultimately have to find new jobs in other companies in order to survive financially.
Even in cases where they are reinstated, the conditions for forming a union are no longer there, as the staff has changed and so the whole organising process has to be started again, more or less from scratch.
Companies also use other ways of blocking trade union organising at all costs, such as filing appeals for the dissolution of the union.
Where a union does exist in a company, the management deploys relentless union-busting tactics, making arbitrary demands and threats, taking reprisals and ill-treating union members.
Corruption is common amongst labour inspectors, some of whom go as far as selling lists of trade union members to company managers.
This, compounded by the government's failure to provide inspector's with adequate resources, goes some way towards explaining the state's ineffectiveness in protecting labour rights.
Fear of reprisals: Since the coup d'état, all union activities have been restricted by the fear of being attacked at any events or meetings that may be held.
All trade union leaders were under threat.
Trade union rights not protected: In practice, workers have no adequate legal protection against anti-union discrimination.
They are harassed and even sacked for engaging in union activities.
Workers trying to form unions in the export processing zones are sacked and blacklisted, as well as being intimidated, separated from their colleagues, mentally harassed and, in some instances, physically assaulted.
Judicial processes are long and when the rulings do support the reinstatement of workers, they are generally ignored by companies without any adequate follow-up by the state.
Collective bargaining: One method used by employers to undermine the free exercise of collective bargaining rights is the creation of a parallel association that responds to the management's interests and which they authorise to negotiate a collective agreement that suits them.
This allows them to circumvent any genuine workers' demands and to neutralise any trade union action.
Serious violations against women trade unionists' rights: Serious attacks on women trade unionists' rights were registered throughout the year, such as the rape and beating suffered by teaching trade union representative, Irma Villanueva, at the hands of four police officers; the verbal and sexual assault on Sister Reyna del Carmen Rodríguez by the security forces; the attack on Alba Leticia Ochoa, brutally beaten during a peaceful demonstration; or the case of Agustina Flores López, a member of the Civic Council of Popular Indigenous Organisations of Honduras, who was ruthlessly beaten by the police, in public, and in spite of wide media presence filming the assault.
Trade unionists beaten, arrested, tortured and murdered following the coup d'état: At least 12 trade union activists have been assassinated since the coup overthrowing Honduran President Manuel Zelaya in June.
The killings took place during protests and even in the victims' own homes.
Over 125 trade union leaders were held in illegal detention.
Bomb in trade union head office: In July, a bomb exploded at the head office of the drinks industry workers' union, Trabajadores de la Industria de la Bebida y Similares (STIBYS).
No one was injured, fortunately, as the explosion took place shortly after the members had left the premises after attending the funeral of an assassinated trade union leader.
2009 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Honduras
It was a bloody year for Honduran trade unionists.
The General Secretary of the CTH, Rosa Altagracia Fuentes, was shot to death along with trade union leader Virginia García de Sánchez and Juan Bautista Gálvez, who was accompanying them.
A month later, the leader of ANACH, Israel García, was gunned down and killed.
Two leaders of SITRAFL received threats and were shot at by unknown assailants.
Permanent staff at Lafarge Cementos were fired and replaced with subcontracted workers.
Freedom of association: The law recognises the right to form and join trade unions, but imposes restrictions.
At least 30 workers are needed to form a trade union, which makes it impossible to create trade unions in small companies.
In addition, the Labour Ministry can de-register a union whenever the number of members falls below 30.
Members of the police and the armed forces are banned from forming trade unions and establishing collective bargaining.
The Organic Law on the police force bans security guards from joining a union.
There cannot be more than one union in a given enterprise or institution and 90 per cent of the workers belonging to that union must be Honduran nationals.
Trade union officials must be Honduran nationals and must be engaged in the activity concerned.
Workers on farms that do not continually employ more than ten workers are not covered by the Labour Code.
Trade union protection: Protection is provided to workers trying to form a union and to the union's leadership.
However, the measure only covers the leadership of the confederation and not the leaders of federations or branch committees.
What is more, in the event of a trade union leader being dismissed there is no legal procedure to contest the decision and the normal process for dismissals is applied, which clearly affects the right to immediate reinstatement and, thus, the full exercise of trade union rights.
Collective bargaining: The right to collective bargaining is protected by law, and retribution by employers for trade union activity is prohibited.
However, there are restrictions on that right.
Although public employees are allowed to organise they are not allowed to conclude collective agreements.
Also, the Labour Code restricts the matters that can be included in negotiations and stipulates that the Labour Ministry must officially endorse the content of a collective agreement.
Both factors restrict the collective bargaining autonomy of trade unions.
The Minister of Labour submitted a bill that could restrict collective bargaining by requiring trade unions to have a membership of at least 50% of the total workforce, which would undermine their existing rights.
The proposed legislation also replaces the term "collective agreement" with "claims list", whereas the current Chapter IV of the Labour Code contains the more precise wording "Collective Labour Agreement".
Right to strike: The right to strike is also recognised, but limited.
Federations and confederations may not call a strike.
A two-thirds majority of the votes of the total union membership is required to call a strike.
Employees of state-owned enterprises must give six months' notice or have the government's approval before striking.
The Ministry of Labour and Social Security has the power to end disputes in oil production, refining, transport and distribution services.
However, it has no power to ensure that employers comply with the law.
Collective disputes in non-essential public services are subjected to compulsory arbitration and it is not permitted to call a strike while the arbitration process is under way (two years).
Public employees are not allowed to take part in solidarity strikes.
A dangerous draft law: In 2006, the President of Honduras submitted a bill to reform various articles in the Penal Code, with a view to toughening the penalties for participation in street protests, such as the blocking of roads and bridges.
The measure was aimed at blocking trade union action and legalising its repression.
Special laws in the EPZs: The law allows export processing zones to set additional limitations on the right to strike.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2008
Background: The political situation has been complicated by the manoeuvring of the government and opposition parties in the run-up to the 2009 elections.
There were tensions between the government and employers over international relations with third countries.
Employers protested against the government's decision to increase minimum wages.
The problems identified as most serious by the population are organised crime, violence, widespread corruption and the lack of decent work.
Agents infiltrating trade union meetings were found with lists of trade unionists, social and political activists.
Lack of protection of trade union rights: In practice, workers have no law to protect them adequately from anti-union discrimination.
Workers are harassed and even sacked as a result of their union activities.
In the export processing zones (EPZs) workers trying to form unions are sacked and blacklisted, as well as being subjected to harassment, separation from their colleagues, and psychological and even physical abuse.
Judicial processes are long and when the rulings do support the reinstatement of workers they are generally ignored by companies without any adequate follow-up by the State.
Anti-union strategies of companies: Despite the legal recognition of trade union protection, the main strategy still being employed by companies to destroy trade unions is to dismiss all their leaders, often at the very moment the union is founded, thereby preventing its consolidation and growth.
As the reinstatement procedure is very slow, the people concerned ultimately have to find new jobs in other companies in order to survive financially, so, in practice, even where reinstatement is ordered the conditions enabling the creation of a union no longer exist, since the staff has changed, and the whole organising process has to start again more or less from scratch.
Companies also use other ways of blocking trade union organising at all costs, such as filing writs requesting the dissolution of the union.
Where a union does exist in a company, the management tirelessly pursues its tactic of imposing arbitrary demands, threats, reprisals and other forms of mistreatment of the members of the union.
Corruption is common amongst labour inspectors, some of whom even sell lists of trade union members to company managers.
As this is compounded by the government's failure to provide adequate resources to the inspectors, the State is clearly not providing effective protection.
Collective bargaining: One method used by employers to undermine the free exercise of collective bargaining rights is the creation of a parallel "association" that respects the management's interests and which they authorise to negotiate a collective agreement that suits them.
This enables them to sidestep the real demands of the workforce and to neutralise the unions' action.
Violations of the right to organise: In January, maquiladora companies launched a series of measures aimed at dismantling the few trade union organisations remaining in this sector.
The trade union at the PETRALEX factory reported that the company had dismissed the members of the factory's trade union committee for the fourth time.
General Secretary of the CTH murdered: On 24 April, six presumed gang members killed Rosa Altagracia Fuentes, the General Secretary of the Honduran workers' confederation, the Confederación de Trabajadores de Honduras (CTH), leaving her riddled with bullets.
Trade union leader Virginia García de Sánchez and the driver accompanying them, Juan Bautista Gálvez, also lost their lives.
Investigators believe the incident was premeditated and have ruled out robbery as the motive as the police found Altagracia's wallet, holding a considerable amount of money, intact.
The murders remained unpunished at the end of the year.
On apprehending them, the UNAH security guards seized a list of 135 names, including that of the General Secretary of the CTH, Altagracia Fuentes, who had been killed earlier in the year, along with those of other trade union leaders, such as Israel Salinas and Daniel Durón, general secretaries of the national trade union centres, the Confederación Unitaria de Trabajadores de Honduras (CUTH) and the Central General de Trabajadores (CGT).
Workers sacked for forming union: In July, workers at Lido Pozuelo (owned by Mexican transnational Bimbo since March 2008), notified the management and the Ministry of Labour and Social Security that they had formed a trade union.
The next day Bimbo retaliated by firing 62 of them, including the union's founders, some of whom were pregnant.
Ninety-eight percent of the workers are Honduran.
Hassett fails to point out how many workers have already taken pay-cuts, often in the guise of furloughs.
Nor is he volunteering to take a one-third cut in his pay.
Nor, you'll notice, does he have anything to say about big-time CEOs or others among the top 10 percent taking a hit on their paychecks at a time when income inequality has given the United States a rich-poor ratio of a banana republic.
No surprise.
As a colonel in the class war, providing philosophical protection for the top tier is in his job description.
No matter how disastrous actually carrying out his prescription would be.
stinking rich, you're right, they'd never take a pay cut regardless of the fact that it wouldn't have any actual imapact on the quality of their daily lives.
Speaking for myself, and I suspect at least some others, I would have no problem taking a pay cut as long as my rent, utilities, transportation, grocery and other living expenses were also cut.
I don't care about money for money's sake.
I just want to live a modest life with a few comforts.
I think that's what most of us want.
We don't have to be stinking rich to be happy whereas the stinking rich can't seem to be happy with any amount of wealth.
There's no such thing as enough for them.
Speaking for myself, and I suspect at least some others, I would have no problem taking a pay cut as long as my rent, utilities, transportation, grocery and other living expenses were also cut.
I don't care about money for money's sake.
I just want to live a modest life with a few comforts.
it's a downward spiral that will WORSEN unemployment.
Once everyone takes a pay cut, no one has money for even the basic necessities let alone an occasional luxury.
So stores, restaurants, businesses of all kinds close, leaving their employees without work.
so long as it includes a strong social safety net, strong workers' rights, a sane work week that includes overtime for anyone working more than 35 hours, and universal health care.
Funny, I always thought that the road to full employment lay in shortening the work week and lengthening paid vacation times and encouraging early retirement for those who do have jobs--but that would only be able to happen if we got rid of the fat paychecks of CEOs--who certainly don't live next door to me.
Then he should should tell our fat paycheck neighbor CEO's about this, and tell them to take a pay cut and boost employment.
I'm getting 40% of what I made 7 years ago.
I took my pay cut.
Time for the higher-ups to take theirs.
But you have to be either completely out of touch with reality of just plain full o hate to recommend pay cuts for middle America.
You know, it's easy to tell people to take a pay cut and save more if you're making 400k.
Or a few mil.
How is that taking a pay cut would lead to unicorns and rainbows, but increasing taxes-which would have the same effect on people's finances- would lead to destroying Western Civilization?
Really?
I want to see this Kevin Hassett from AEI come here to Vegas and tell it directly to the casino workers who've agreed to multiple pay cuts just to keep their jobs, and to the realtors who are lost upwards of 60% of their commission revenue, and to the electricians and plumbers now working "on call" and just waiting for the next job to come around.
the CEO is not making 75 times the wage of the average worker, I will consider supporting pay cuts for the great unwashed masses of wildly overpaid individuals.
early last year, we were asked to take a 5% pay cut for no more than 6 months.
It lasted 6 months and full pay was restored.
The executives in the company?
They took a 50% pay cut.
We canceled ours, and I took a 10% pay cut.
The fact is that aside from those guys at the tippy top, everybody else is stuck in neutral.
I don't know anyone who has had a raise in a very long time.
My husband works in the film business and his wage has been flat for almost a decade.
What used to be the union minimum has become the standard-- not the starting point it was meant to be.
I think labor has been sacrificing wage increases for years-- functional pay cuts with the cost of living rising around us.
I haven't read his entire article, but there are circumstances where it may be the right thing to do to take a pay cut.
If higher-ups in companies were forthright with financial woes and actually tried to work with their employees in terms of cutting costs, workers could choose between layoffs and pay cuts.
There is a really great example of this in a "This American Life" episode entitled: Social Contract.
The execs should be FIRST to get a pay cut :-P
we can get people in bangladesh to produce drivel for lots less.
The extra money could pay for unemployment insurance for people who have real jobs.
And if it did make a difference, it's going to more likely reduce the total amount going into the economy than increase it (though it would reduce the amount government has to spend, which would offset most, if not all, of that).
As long as we're not talking about people where the decision is to invest in Apple stock or by that 3rd investment house (and we're not), hiring more people with the same wage basically does nothing to help the economy, while at the same time reduces quality of life for the 10 people who have to take a pay cut.
As was noted above.
If people take pay cuts, companies won't respond by saying "hey, we have some extra, money, let's start hiring people!
" they'll respond by just socking the cash away, like they're already doing.
Businesses already have the cash to hire if they wanted to.
They either feel like they don't need to or are wanting to make a rainy day fund because they don't actually believe we're out of the woods yet.
Tell you what Mr Hasset - there's nothing like leading by example: you take a pay cut, and persuade all your peers to do so as well.
We'll take a pay cut just as soon as every CEO, COO, etc.
takes one.
I get the distinct impression that rich con-servatives just won't be happy until slavery is made legal and human cloning is providing free labor.
Bah! I hate the smell of stupid in the morning.
The reason?
because they have work rules in law that enable corporations to split the hours between workers so in bad times those who might get overtime give their hours to those who will have theirs cut - a share philosophy that works very well apparently.
How about I take YOUR job, Hasset, and then maybe I'll take a pay cut from that.
Yup, then I might consider a pay cut, and if subsidized grocery stores were thrown in, I might give that some consideration too.
Well, OK then.
33% pay cut for every bankster, lobbyist, congressperson, corporate executive and broadcast media on-air personality it is then.
Once this has been done, but not until, we can then think about cutting worker's wages.
It's only fair that leaders lead us, right?
has been threatening labor with job loss ever since Chrysler went to the UAW with a demand for pay cuts in hand before they went to Washington to ask to be bailed out.
Now pay cuts do make sense in the context of deflation.
But deflation is something only wacky leftists who think we need more stimulus like Paul Krugman are concerned with.
Serious People are worried about a bond bubble burst, raising interest rates and inflation.
Considering I haven't gotten a raise in over two years now, I don't really think a pay cut is in order... Even taking a pay cut may not create positions - at least where I work it probably wouldn't.
A reduced rate of consumption is effectively the same thing as a pay cut.
We have less "money" to throw around, so we have to be a lot smarter about what we do with it.
We don't buy things we don't need or that won't last, we don't burn energy needlessly, etc.
Hasset and I have arrived at a vaguely similar place, although not, I suspect, by the same reasoning: namely, someone has to take a pay cut.
All that remains to decide (comedic understatement) is the details of who that will be, by how much, and what arrangements, if any, will be made to smooth the transition to a sustainable economy.
We shouldn't be surprised or shocked when change comes.
We know it is coming.
What we should be is vigilant as to the form in which economic/social/political change is presented, and as to the values and principles behind it.
When Republicans like Hasset propose that workers should take a pay cut, Social Security needs to be cut, privatized, or eliminated, etc-- but the richest 1% shouldn't give up anything at all-- those policies are based on exactly the WRONG values and principles.
We need to stop that sh*t dead before it gets started.
I can only wonder if his idea will include cutting social security checks.
Now that would really get all the Senior's pissed off, as they whine about everything, as long as it doesn't impact them.
Meanwhile, the middle class got rudely introduced to such life-changing trends as outsourcing, permanent downsizing, pay cuts and this unusually severe recession.
Your article quotes Lawrence Summers's explanation that unemployment insurance and other social insurance programs raise the reservation wage.
Were it not for these programs, desperate workers would lower their reservation wage, and this would lead them to find employment faster.
As a professor of economics, I taught this to my students for years.
But for the past year, having found myself unemployed, I have learned that the logic of that statement is not always correct.
is wasted on a buffoon.
Go get a real job, Hasset, one where you actually have to work for a living.
One making, say, 60K a year.
Buy a house, start a family... then take a pay cut to 40K and then come back and write this piece of shit over again.
Yet another functional use of bigotry in politics; entitlements and pay cuts are only for the "other", not for you...
Let the TwoPercenters take their own damn pay cut
The folks who SHOULD take a pay cut are
THAT is who needs to take a pay cut.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Hungary
Trade union registration practices are long and cumbersome, and judges and prosecutors are free to interfere with internal trade union matters.
Organising in multinationals is particularly difficult.
Public sector workers' trade union rights are limited, and collective bargaining is difficult to initiate.
Despite a fairly solid legal framework, some problematic areas remain.
The Constitution and the Labour Code recognise the right to organise and the right to strike.
While employers are not allowed to hire temporary workers during a strike, temporary workers already hired before the strike are allowed to continue working.
Furthermore, although the right to collective bargaining is recognised, many public service workers are exempted from this right.
The thresholds for unions to be recognised as bargaining agents are also excessively high.
Public servants may negotiate on working conditions, but the final decision on increasing public service pay rests with Parliament.
The right to strike is likewise restricted for public sector workers, and can only be exercised in accordance with special regulations contained in an agreement signed between the government and public sector unions in 1994.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Background: In April the new Prime Minister Gordon Bajnai announced a programme of public spending cuts, tax rises and public wage freezes.
In April some 3,000 workers, representing all six national trade union centres, rallied in front of the Parliament building in Budapest to protest against the anti-crisis measures which put most of the burden on employees.
Major strikes in the transport sector took place throughout the year.
Protection in court cumbersome: The National Confederation of Hungarian Trade Unions MSZOSZ reports that if a trade union refuses to agree to a shop steward's dismissal, and the employer appeals against this in court, defending the trade union position becomes very difficult.
A 2005 amendment to the Labour Code eased the trade union's burden of proof, but it has not yet resulted in more effective protection of trade union officials.
Many obstacles to union registration: Trade unions report that when registering a union, judges often request additional documents or data that is difficult to obtain and/or unnecessary for the establishment of a union.
There have been cases where the judge asked the union to re-write its whole application due to some minor flaw in it.
In addition, trade unions are required to prove that they have the right to use the property or the premises of their head office.
If the premises are owned by several individuals or companies, the procedure becomes even more complicated.
There were also cases where the employer's written consent was required to establish a union or where the union had to use the company's name in its official name.
There were also cases tantamount to direct interference in trade union administration: the court ordered the union to provide very detailed operational rules in its constitution, or to define which professional categories it covered, failing which the court would reject the membership fee rates (1% of the salary) as being "undemocratic".
Prosecutors monitor trade union activities: The national legislation gives the prosecutors' offices the right to oversee trade union activities.
The prosecutors may review general and ad hoc decisions of the organisations, conduct inspections or request other state bodies to do so, and must be granted access to the trade union offices.
Prosecutors have organised inspections to verify "the lawfulness of trade union operations".
The unions were asked to provide documents such as registration documents, membership records with original membership application forms, minutes of the meetings of union bodies and their resolutions, the general ledger, an inventory of assets, documents pertaining to financial support including unsuccessful fund-raising applications, tax returns, statistical reports, invitations to trade union events and the like.
The practice was not uniform, as some prosecutors only asked the union to provide a written summary of matters such as the membership or the union's financial situation.
There were cases where the prosecutor was not satisfied with a trade union's financial reporting, and ordered additional reports well above what is provided by law.
Sometimes the prosecutor interfered in matters of a purely internal nature, such as weighted voting in trade union bodies or information on termination of membership.
Trade unions can appeal against prosecutors' orders in court, but the proceedings take time and in the meantime the union has to work in a climate of uncertainty.
Court rulings only apply to specific cases so they do not prevent further interference by prosecutors in the future.
Anti-union tactics: Anti-union behaviour is not uncommon.
Cases of employers intimidating trade union members, transferring, relocating or dismissing trade union officers, and hindering trade unions from entering the workplace occur every year.
Although unfair dismissal cases are usually won by the workers, court proceedings often take over a year.
2008 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Hungary
The law protects trade union rights, but some problems persist as regards the right to bargain collectively.
The Korean Hankoon Tyre company lost a part of state funding for union-busting and labour law violations.
Several violations of the right to strike were reported during the year.
The Hungarian Constitution and the Labour Code recognise the right to organise and the right to strike.
The 2002 Labour Code obliges the employer to deduct union membership fees from the employee's pay and transfer them to the union concerned upon receipt of a written request by the employee.
The Code also provides for statutory time off for union activists.
The employers are not allowed to hire temporary agency workers during a strike, but temporary workers already hired before the strike are allowed to continue working.
Union officials protected from dismissal: The law prohibits trade union discrimination and provides for protection from dismissal for trade union officials.
However, the National Confederation of Hungarian Trade Unions MSZOSZ (affiliated to the ITUC) reports that if a trade union refuses to agree to a shop steward's dismissal, and the employer appeals the refusal in court, defending the trade union position becomes very difficult.
The 2005 amendment to the Labour Code eased the trade union's burden of proof, but it has not yet resulted in the more efficient protection of trade union officials.
High hurdles to collective bargaining: Collective bargaining is permitted at the enterprise and industry level.
Section 33 of the Labour Code requires trade unions to represent 65 percent (individually) or 50 percent (jointly) of workers to be able to engage in collective bargaining, which is in excess of ILO standards.
New legislation introduced in 2006 that applies to public service gives the right to bargain collectively to trade unions who represent, individually or jointly, at least 25% of the workforce in a given agency; otherwise, the collective agreement must be voted on.
Once a union is established, the employer and the union are under an obligation to cooperate.
Under a separate law, public servants may negotiate working conditions, but the final decision on increasing public service pay rests with Parliament.
Constitutionality of social dialogue questioned: In December 2006 the Parliament passed a law on the National Interest Reconciliation Council (OET) and another law on sectoral social dialogue committees, both laws fully accepted by workers' and employers' organisations.
The Hungarian president, László Sólyom, vetoed both laws and transmitted them to the Constitutional Court.
While the president's concern with the sectoral committees was largely technical, he claimed that in case of the OET, since the majority of workers and employers in the country were not organised, the institution lacked legitimacy to exercise public powers such as determination of minimum wage and right of consent in the rules of job assessment.
No decision was taken by the end of the year.
Good conduct in labour relations becomes a condition for state tenders: Hungarian companies that wish to bid for state-funded tenders need to prove their good conduct as regards labour relations.
A company must certify that it has not been sanctioned for violating labour laws, that it is not a party to court proceedings that could result in such a sanction being imposed, and that there are no significant conflicts between the company's management and labour.
As a result, large companies have begun to appreciate the importance of good cooperation with trade unions.
Clearer responsibilities and a stronger mandate for the labour inspectorate have also had a positive impact, especially after it was decided that an inspection should follow any worker's or trade union's complaint.
A new tripartite body, the Council for Supporting the Labour Inspectorate, has been established.
Trade union rights in practice and Violations in 2007
Background: The country was overwhelmed with strikes and protest.
In November several trade unions organised a nationwide strike and a 10,000 people strong rally in front of the Hungarian Parliament, protesting the overhaul of the health and pension systems.
On the other hand, just like a year ago, violent far-right protesters took over the streets of Budapest in October, with riot police using tear gas and water cannons.
In February, a special commission of enquiry into 2006 events criticised the police for the excessive use of force.
Weaknesses in the system: Two national trade union centres, MSZOSZ and LIGA, have reported cases of employers intimidating trade union members, transferring, relocating or dismissing trade union officers, and hindering trade unions from entering the workplace, noting that such violations are repeated year by year.
Although unfair dismissal cases are usually won by the workers, it is not uncommon for court proceedings to take over a year.
Unfortunately, too few cases are exposed, or even reported to the trade union organisations, because of workers' insufficient legal knowledge and fear of blacklisting.
However, in a number of cases workers and trade unions have had their rights adequately protected in the courts.
Protestors accused of politicking: In November, LIGA had its independence questioned by the ruling party.
On 18 November, a member of the right-wing opposition party, Fidesz, stated that the party fully supported the demonstrations, although they would not participate in them.
This prompted the Socialist Party spokesperson István Nyakó to suggest that the trade union action was in fact political and that Fidesz had been pulling strings in the background.
LIGA vehemently denied these accusations.
Hankook Tyre – state funding and union busting: In June, having secured a deal of approximately 1 million Euros in state funding, the Korean Hankook Tyre factory opened a factory in the city of Dunaújváros (central Hungary).
The Hungarian government called it "the investment of the decade" and "the most modern factory in the world", but what also made international headlines was the company's violations of workers rights.
On top of extreme overtime, poor working conditions and pay irregularities, the management was enticing workers not to join trade unions, obstructing union meetings and intimidating the local trade union representatives.
The local organisation of ICEM-affiliated Federation of Chemical, Energy and General workers' union was told to prove that it was organised legally within the company.
When the union refused to give the employer its full membership list, the management said that the union would not be recognised and that the works council would be the only bargaining partner.
At least one trade unionist was sacked during the year.
The union's complaints were thoroughly investigated, and in September the company had to pay an equivalent of almost 100 000 euros for violations of labour laws, including bringing in irregular migrants.
The government reacted by postponing a part of subsidies in November.
Budapest airport on strike again: Last year's Survey reported anti-union behaviour in the Budapest airport.
This year brought more conflicts, leading to a number of strikes in spring.
When the unions and the employers could not reach the agreement on wage raises, the Turkish company Celebi that acquired Budapest Airport Handling Ltd approached some 120 workers individually, offering them pay raises by means of individual agreements.
Temporary agency workers were enticed to sign the agreement with a promise to be re-hired on a permanent basis, and they were asked to work overtime to compensate for the strikers.
The RDSZSZ union (affiliated to LIGA) filed a complaint to the labour inspectorate; however, the dispute was later resolved through mediation.
More attacks on the right to strike: Trade unions in the electricity sector and the Hungarian state railways called strikes for the beginning of February 2007 in response to the government's attempt to eliminate employees' benefits.
Four employers' organisations tried to get an injunction from the Labour Court of Budapest, claiming that the employers affected by the strike were victim of the government's decision in which they had no say, and that therefore the strike was illegal.
The court rejected the claim.
In August, there were reports of the Budapest public transport company trying to recruit temporary bus drivers in view of an upcoming strike.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - India
Despite barriers to organising and the recognition of trade unions in law and practice, workers engaged in illegal strikes and protests to establish basic rights to bargain and union recognition.
There were many incidents of police and company sponsored violence against trade union officials and workers.
One worker died during protests in Gurgaon, Haryana.
Thousands of workers were arrested or faced criminal charges for engaging in strikes and protests.
Numerous trade union leaders were arrested and harassed for their activities.
While basic trade union rights are guaranteed, many restrictions apply in particular in the various states.
Workers may establish and join unions of their own choosing, however the Trade Unions Act does not apply in Sikkim.
Consequently, workers there do not benefit from the same trade union rights, and union activities are very restricted.
In all of India, a union must represent an inordinate 100 workers or 10% of the workforce in order to register, and the law limits the number of "outsiders" to sit on a union executive committee.
While strikes are permitted in the special economic zones, a 45-day strike notice period is required.
In the State of Kerala, general strikes are illegal and organisers of such a strike can be held financially liable for damages caused to an employer, while in Tamul Nadu, the Essential Services Maintenance Act prescribes imprisonment of up to three years for strikes in "essential services", and defines a strike as including a refusal to work overtime.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Hostile employers, poor law enforcement: The generally hostile attitude of employers towards trade unions is clearly a deterrent to organising.
Employers tend to either ignore the law making it illegal to dismiss a worker for their trade union activities or circumvent it by transferring workers to other locations to disrupt union activities or discourage union formation.
Seeking justice through the judicial process is time consuming and very costly.
Employers also establish and recognize "worker committees" or company dominated unions to avoid genuine trade union representation.
Death amid protests in the auto industry: About 1,300 workers from Rico Auto Industries Ltd. (Rico) in Gurgaon, Haryana, went on strike on 21 September after the company suspended 16 of their co-workers.
The workers also demanded the recognition of their trade union formed by the All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC).
Pushpinder Singh, Secretary of the RICO employees union, said that Rico locked out the workers and suspended the 16 workers right after he filed the registration of the union at the labour department in Chandigarh.
On 22 September, at least 35 workers were injured when police lathi-charged 3,500 demonstrating workers off the Delhi-Gurgaon expressway near Hero Honda Chowk, Haryana, where the workers were protesting the dismissal of their 16 co-workers.
At least five persons, including a boy, were injured in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir when police lathi-charged, fired teargas shells, and used water cannons to disperse a rally of striking employees of State Road Transport Corporation on 1 September.
The striking employees demanded the payment of their salaries that had not been paid for last five months.
In addition, on 15 September, police lathi-charged workers of the unorganised sector affiliated with the Congress of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) who were picketing the Vikasa Soudha complex demanding an increase in minimum wages and regularisation of services of daily-wage workers.
Several leaders, including leaders from the CITU and the Communist Party of India, were injured in the lathi-charge.
Workers arrested and charged with criminal offences: Mundra police officials in Gujarat State filed a charge against 5,000 workers at the Siracha power plant for demonstrating on 7 May after a worker died in an accident.
On 19 June, police arrested 70 contractual teachers who protested near Matka Chowk to demand regularisation of their teaching position by the Chandigarh Union Territory Administration.
The teachers were charged for allegedly violating orders imposed under Section 144, CrPC.
Then, on 29 June, police arrested the Jeeva Oppantha Thozhilalar Sangham (affiliated to the All India Trade Union Congress AITUC) vice-president and two executive members who had lead a strike by a section of the contract workers at the Neyveli Lignite Corporation in Chennai, Tamil Nadu.
On 15 September, Kothrud police in Maharashtra State charged Kirloskar Cummins Employees' Union President Mahendra Balwadkar and 800 to 1,000 employees of Cummins India Limited at Dahanukar colony in Kothrud for alleged destruction of company property following a demonstration by the workers over the suspension of 11 union workers.
In another event, police in Naupada, Andhra Pradesh, arrested and detained more than 12 protesting civil service workers who were members of the Municipal Labour Union for engaging in an unlawful assembly outside the municipal government headquarters on 1 December.
The group was protesting against the imposition of the new biometric attendance system.
Police also arrested Prashant, Pramod Kumar and Tapish Maindola of the Joint Workers' Rights Struggle Forum of the Modern laminators Ltd. and Modern Packaging Ltd. factories at Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh on 15 October, and were held in detention for seven days.
Anti-union tactics at Hyundai: More than 1,300 Hyundai Motor India Employees' Union (HMIEU) workers at Hyundai Motor India Limited (HMIL), located in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, went on strike on 20 April after management refused to negotiate with the union.
Since July 2007, HMIEU trade union leaders, members, and supporters have suffered from dismissals, suspensions, and transfers.
They have also faced the company's widespread use of threats, harassment, and intimidation for joining a union.
The struggle intensified on 6 May when 900 strikers were arrested, which prompted letters of protest as well as meetings and demonstrations at Hyundai's headquarters in Korea by International Metalworkers' Federation affiliates.
As of December 2009, 65 workers have been fired for their union activities and 34 more were in the process of being dismissed.
Rubber workers' union finally vindicated: In a labour dispute that has its origins in ILO complaints filed in 2006 and 2007 by the Madras Rubber Factory United Workers Union (MRFUWU), on 9 May, hundreds of workers struck the Madras Rubber Factory (MRF) tyre company factories in Arakonam, Tamil Nadu, and in Puducherry.
The workers demanded a pay increase and recognition of the MRFUWU as the legitimate representative of MRF workers.
The MRF responded to the strike by locking out workers on 17 May.
Then, on 20 May, police arrested and removed over 600 striking workers at the MRF plant in Arakonam, as well as those demonstrating outside the factory.
Three days later, police arrested nearly 3,000 striking Arakonam MRF workers and family members and who were camping outside the labour commissioner's office.
Both the MRFUWU and MRF filed a number of court cases as a result of the 9 May strike.
However, on 9 September the Madras High Court issued a decision that the MRFUWU has to be recognised by the MRF management and should agree to adhere to the ILO recommendations.
On 14 September, MRFUWU ended its 125 day strike and resumed work.
Nestlé coerced unionists, obtained injunctions: On 27 April, 750 workers at Nestlé's factory in Pantnagar, Uttar Pradesh, went on strike demanding the reinstatement of unfairly dismissed workers, permanent jobs for over 400 "trainees" illegally denied job security, and an end to management interference in the registration of their trade union, the Nestlé Mazdoor Sangh (Nestle Workers Union – NWU).
The union began the strike when management attempted to force four workers to "voluntarily" resign as part of an effort to prevent union organising.
Three workers refused and were dismissed.
After an agreement was made between the union and management on 1 May, the next day the company suspended four NWU leaders, including the union president.
Workers attempted to resume their strike but police prevented them from protesting at the factory.
In March, 55 workers officially formed the NWU when they submitted an application for registration with the local authorities.
In response, Nestlé threatened 25 workers and forced them to sign a false statement claiming that they joined the union under "coercion".
2007 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - India
Barriers to the organising of trade unions continued in law and practice, and the government maintained strong restrictions on the right to strike.
Workers at two garment factories faced a systematic anti-union campaign, while Unilever closed down a factory to remove the union.
A farm worker was killed when police attacked protestors.
The government remains committed to a policy of creating greater flexibility in labour law which would be detrimental to workers and their unions.
Freedom of association limited: Under the 2001 Trade Unions Act, a union has to represent a minimum of 100 workers – which is excessive by international standards – or ten per cent of the workforce, whichever is less.
The act also sets limits on the number of "outsiders" (those not employed at the enterprise) allowed to sit on a union executive and requires unions to submit their accounts for auditing.
Anti-union discrimination: The Trade Unions Act prohibits discrimination against union members and organisers, and employers can be punished if they discriminate against employees engaged in union activity.
Restrictions on the right to strike: Under the 1947 Industrial Disputes Act (IDA), industry workers in public utilities have to announce a strike at least 14 days in advance.
In some states, the law demands that certain private sector unions must submit formal notification of a strike before it is considered legal.
However, the IDA does specifically prohibit employers from retaliating against workers for their participation in a legal strike.
The Central Civil Services (Conduct) Rule, 1964, stipulates that no government servant shall resort to, or in any way abet, any form of a strike.
In August 2003 the Supreme Court ruled that government employees did not have the right to strike because it "inconvenienced citizens and cost the state money".
The ruling came following a strike in the Tamil Nadu state, whose government dismissed 350,000 striking employees.
In December 2003, the Court ruled that lawyers had no right to go on strike, or to boycott the courts.
Increased threat of "reforms" to gut labour laws: The government has aimed for a number of years to create a more flexible labour market in which employers could hire and fire employees at will, and easily hire workers on contracts.
The Ministry of Labour drafted amendments to the labour laws in 2003, and in 2005 developed a policy proposal entitled "Making Labour Markets Flexible" to explain its initiative.
The strident opposition of India's trade unions has been critical in forcing the government to re-consider the wisdom of formally introducing the proposed changes to the law and policies.
As a result, during 2006 there was no concrete legislative action taken on the government's proposed labour law reform agenda.
Sikkim – excluded from the law: The Trade Unions Act, even after its amendment in 2001, does not apply in Sikkim, a State annexed to India in 1975.
Consequently, workers there do not benefit from trade union rights.
Although there are some workers' associations, no one sector, as such, is organised.
Registration of trade unions is subject to a police inquiry and then depends upon receiving the permission of the Land Revenue Department of the Government of Sikkim.
One negative comment by the police about a member of the union's executive can be grounds for refusing registration.
Furthermore, the public too has an opportunity to state its objections to the creation of a trade union, which can also prevent its registration.
According to the State government, however, no such instance of objection by the public to the creation of a union had come to its notice.
Repressive legislation in Tamil Nadu State: The Tamil Nadu Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) was passed in May 2002.
Characterised by trade union leaders as one of the most repressive pieces of legislation enacted against workers in India since Independence, the Act prescribes a punishment of up to three years' imprisonment and a 5,000 rupee fine against participants in a strike involving "essential services".
A large number of public services are included within the definition of "essential", such as those relating to the supply of water and electricity, passenger and goods transport, fire fighting and public health.
Activists who call for a strike or instigate workers to go on strike, or anyone who provides financial assistance for the conduct of a strike, risks the same penalties.
Under the Act, the word "strike" not only includes the refusal of employees connected with these "essential services" to "continue to work or to accept work assigned", but also a "refusal to work overtime" and "any other conduct which is likely to result in, or results in, cessation or substantial retardation of work in any essential service".
The government has ignored ILO recommendations to amend the Act.
Export processing zones (EPZs): The right to join trade unions and bargain collectively exists in law for EPZs.
In the 2001 Trade Union Act, the government designated the EPZs and Special Economic Zones (SEZs) as "public utilities", requiring a 45-day strike notice period.
The Mahanagar Asangathit Mazdoor union reported that the government of Delhi State has exempted EPZs from most labour legislation and there is a ban on the formation of trade unions.
Hostile employers, poor law enforcement: The hostile attitude of employers towards trade unions is clearly a deterrent to organising.
Employers tend to either ignore the law making it illegal to dismiss a worker for their trade union activities or circumvent it by transferring workers to other locations to disrupt union activities or discourage union formation.
Seeking justice through the judicial process is time consuming and costly.
Unions report that some employers resort to intimidation, threats, demotion, beatings and, in extreme cases, death threats or even attempted murder against trade unionists.
A more popular form of harassment, however, is the filing of false criminal charges.
One problem with such charges, in addition to unfair dismissal, is that the courts are excruciatingly slow.
Legal charges brought by a police officer against 12 leaders of a tea workers' union, the Hind Khet Mazoor Panchayat (HKMP) took 13 years to come to court.
Three of the accused had passed away in the interim.
There was no concrete evidence to support the charges filed, but the legal battle effectively the officers from their union work for all that time.
Globalisation and economic liberalisation have created a climate in which there is further pressure to dilute labour standards, in particular labour inspections and the enforcement of labour legislation.
For example, during the year the Haryana State Government created a "State Labour Policy 2006" to reform the way that the State Government enforces labour laws.
The State now forbids more than one labour inspection per factory per year.
Repression in the construction and ship-breaking industries: Contractors and sub-contractors in the construction industry are loathe to allow workers to exercise their right to trade union membership, and are likely to threaten them with dismissal should they try.
Since all work is project-based, the possibilities for engaging in collective bargaining are extremely limited.
Similarly, in the ship-breaking industry, employment is so precarious that workers do not try to enforce their right to organise trade unions.
Anyone who even attempts to demand a wage increase is fired instantaneously.
Intimidation is commonplace and the "muqadam", who is responsible for hiring and supervising the workers, sides more with the ship-breaker than with the workers.
Export processing zones (EPZs): The government seeks to keep trade union activity in the country's EPZs to a minimum.
Although the right to join trade unions and to bargain collectively exists in law, in reality entry to the zones is restricted to the workers, who are transported in by their employers.
Since trade unionists are not able to enter, organising is extremely difficult and union activity rare in the EPZs.
There are moves to exempt the zones from the application of labour laws.
Some states, such as Andhra Pradesh, have even dissuaded labour departments from conducting inspections in the zones.
The majority of workers in the EPZs are women, employed in industries such as ready-made garments, electronics and software.
In the Santacruz Electronics Export Processing Zone (SEEPZ) near Bombay, 90 per cent of the workers are women who are generally young and too frightened to form unions.
Working conditions are bad and overtime is compulsory.
Workers fear victimisation by management and those who protest are immediately sacked.
It is common for workers to be employed by fictitious contractors on temporary contracts rather than directly by the company.
In the Noida EPZ, workers have been sacked for demanding that labour laws should be implemented.
During 2006, state and national governments, unions and employers held strenuous public and private debates over the right of workers in the IT sector to form unions.
The public debate was caused by the decision of the CITU on 14 November to organise the West Bengal IT Staff Association (WBITSA) as a first step towards assisting IT workers to be represented by trade unions.
IT employer associates immediately attacked the move as a "retrograde step" that they claimed would damage the international competitiveness of call centres in West Bengal.
Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, the West Bengal Chief Minister was reported to oppose the creation of unions in the IT sector but later he denied holding any such position when he met with a delegation of trade union leaders in late December.
A mass strike across all economic sectors called by the CITU for 14 December did not exempt IT workers, and in response, the West Bengal Government declared it would not tolerate workers' pickets outside of the Salt Lake Electronics Complex, the hub of IT offices in the State.
As the year ended, the issue was still undecided about whether IT work would be classified by the government as an "essential service" and therefore subject to restrictions on the right to strike.
Blocking the union at Fibre & Fabrics International (FFI) and Jeans Knit Pvt.
Ltd (JKPL): Investigations in 2005 and 2006 by labour rights organisations based in Bangalore discovered a pattern of systematic and grave abuses of workers' rights at FFI and JKPL.
Workers were not allowed to form unions, and were intimidated to prevent them from engaging in any collective activity to stand up for their rights.
In clear contravention of the labour law, FFI workers were employed without written contracts.
Moreover, credible worker interviews discovered that supervisors consistently intimidated and abused workers with threats of discipline and termination if they complained about wages (such as unpaid overtime), health and safety problems, or other poor working conditions.
Supervisors also engaged in physical violence against workers, and, in some cases, sexual harassment.
Harassment of Self-Employed Workers Association (SEWA) by Gujarat State Government continues: SEWA, a dynamic trade union of 700,000 informal sector workers operating in Ahmedabad and surrounding areas, continued to face difficulties as a result of a campaign of systematic harassment from the conservative BJP-led government of Gujarat state.
The problems started when the Gujarat government halted funding from the UN's International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) to SEWA for the support of 14,000 families impacted by a devastating 2001 earthquake.
Government allegations that there were "financial irregularities" were belied by the fact that its own auditors had examined SEWA's accounts, and already approved the audits.
This brought SEWA to publicly state in October 2005 that the government's campaign seeks "to destroy our credibility, our solidarity, and our reputation.
" SEWA announced it had no option but to end all cooperation with any Gujarat government agencies.
The Gujarat government further retaliated by cutting off all support and funds for a network of SEWA-established cooperatives and day care centres.
The Government even went so far as to cut off food aid projects for children.
Meanwhile, SEWA publicly disclosed all the organisation's financial accounts and hired an independent CPA to review and audit the accounts.
The auditor's report on SEWA received the central Indian government's official approval, providing further evidence of the baseless nature of the Gujarat government's allegations.
Despite these actions, the Government of Gujarat refused to acknowledge the auditor's findings, and continued its campaign of harassment of SEWA – thereby indicating the essentially political nature of the Gujarat government's attacks against SEWA.
According to the IUF, this unlawful behaviour is not a new trend for the Mumbai factory management of HUL.
In fact, the sale of the factory to a HUL proxy company and its subsequent shuttering are just the final steps in a long anti-union campaign.
Management's practice of refusing to bargain in good faith and reach agreements with the union, dating back to 1986, forced the union to repeatedly rely on court intervention to secure wage increases in line with inflation.
In December 2005, the Supreme Court of India ended the company's ten year battle in the courts by conclusively deciding that the company had engaged in unfair labour practices under the Industrial Disputes Act.
In March 2006, the factory's Vice-Chairman and three other senior managers were cited for contempt of court for failing to obey the court's order to rectify the identified labour abuses – and all four were arrested and then released on bail.
In October, the IUF filed a complaint at the OECD, alleging Unilever and its subsidiary HUL had consistently violated the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, and at the end of the year, the case was under joint consideration of by the British and Netherlands OECD contact points.
Toyota fires union leaders, locks striking workers: On 6 January, management of the carmaker Toyota Kirloskar Motor Private Ltd (89% owned by Toyota) fired three union leaders of the Toyota Kirloskar Motor Employees' Union, affiliated to the Centre for Indian Trade Unions, for alleged 'disciplinary' reasons.
Union members at the factory in Bidadi (on the outskirts of Bangalore) countered that the factory-level leaders had in fact been terminated because of their active role in the union, and 1,550 workers promptly went out on a wild-cat strike to demand reinstatement of their leaders.
Management responded with a lock-out of the strikers, starting on 8 January, and suspended another 27 union members.
Three separate efforts by government regulators to mediate a resolution to the impasse failed, as management repeatedly refused to meet with the union for joint talks, and insisted that all strikers sign a pledge to "maintain discipline and ensure full production" before allowing them to return to work.
Finally, at the prompting of the company, the Karnataka State Labour Secretary issued an order on 21 January, prohibiting the workers' strike from continuing.
On the same day, 1,300 striking workers were arrested by police for unlawful assembly as they marched to petition the State Labour Secretary.
Most of the workers were released the same day.
Deprived of their right to strike, union members were compelled to return to work on 24 January and to sign a modified written pledge before entering the factory.
The dismissal of the three union leaders and suspensions of 27 workers were appealed by the union to the Labour Court.
Mass arrest of CITU protesters in Madras: Factory shut-downs in the Madras EPZ prompted a series of mass protests by unions affiliated with the Centre for Indian Trade Unions (CITU), demanding that employers pay outstanding wage demands for laid-off workers.
On 21 March, police attacked a rally near the entrance to the EPZ, and arrested over 300 union members on charges of illegal assembly.
all collective agreements set basic weekly working hours for full-time staff at between 35 hours and 40 hours a week, whilst in many countries such as Spain and Sweden there are statutory limits of 40 hours for normal weekly working time.
White collar workers across Europe continue to work less hours than blue collar workers, although this gap is narrowing over time.
Every EU country permits certain levels of overtime to be worked in addition to regular hours, but not all recognise the 48 hours per week maximum limit established by the EC Working Time Directive.
Since 1988, when the European Union began to activate its social agenda, a wide range of measures have been introduced to establish a minimum safety net of protection for employees.
These have included strict controls on working time, improved entitlements to annual, maternity and parental leave and opportunities to work on a part-time basis.
The governments of many EU member states have further enhanced these entitlements and created additional rights such as paternity leave, sabbaticals, sick leave arrangements and leave to care for dependants.
Legally enforceable collective agreements have also gone beyond basic statutory rights to introduce even more opportunities to take time off work, and double holiday pay received by workers in some countries makes it more financially rewarding to be on annual leave than at work.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Indonesia
The legal framework is not conducive to trade union activities, and the right to strike is very limited.
Furthermore, the government continued to undermine worker rights by failing to enforce labour laws.
Unions that attempted to enforce their basic contractual or statutory rights by resorting to strikes found that the government ignored flagrant violations of law.
Workers and union officials also faced criminal charges for false charges raised by employers as a way to frustrate union representation.
Despite initial guarantees, trade union rights are not adequately secured in law.
Although private sector workers are free to form unions, in order to register, a union must represent or receive the support of more than 50% of the total workforce in the establishment.
Unions must also keep the government informed of changes in their governing bodies, and failure to do so can result in the loss of official recognition.
A court can dissolve a union if its basic principles conflict with the Constitution or "Pancasila", the national ideology which puts emphasis on consensus and national unity.
Once a union is dissolved, its leaders are not allowed to form another one for three years.
Furthermore, while the right to bargaining is recognised, all collective agreements must be concluded within 30 days after the beginning of negotiations or be submitted for mediation, conciliation or arbitration.
The right to strike is seriously circumscribed by the fact all strikes must be preceded by a lengthy and cumbersome mediation/conciliation procedure, and a lawful strike can only be called as "a result of failed negotiations".
Failure is classified as a deadlock "that is declared by both sides", which gives the employers unilateral power to stop a strike.
Strikes are also banned in "enterprises that cater to the interest of the general public" and in "essential services", but the types of enterprises covered are not specified, leaving it to the government's discretion to decide on a case-by-case basis.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Legal strikes difficult in practice: Since the procedures for mediating a labour dispute are both excessively cumbersome and time consuming, they are often ignored by union leaders.
Hence the government declares most strikes as illegal job actions, which results in mass dismissals of union officials and workers as well as the arrest and imprisonment of union leaders.
Strikes have also been entirely prohibited in the public sector, in essential services, and at enterprises that serve the public interest.
Flagrant violations of worker benefits provided in labour law: Most companies in Indonesia flaunt the basic provisions of labour law with impunity.
Even where unions have successfully negotiated collective bargaining agreements, employers will still ignore worker entitlements under labour law and/or blatantly repudiate the terms of the agreements.
Indonesia's labour law fails to protect workers in practice because the law does not distinguish strike actions to enforce labour law or contract rights from strikes solely involving the economic interests of workers.
Flawed fundamentals: There are four main issues that undermine and frustrate effective union representation of workers and the proper exercise of workers' freedom of association.
The first issue is the illegal and improper use of contract labour.
Section 59 of the Manpower Act provides that contract labour is to be used only for work that is "temporary in nature", however many employers wilfully violate these provisions as a way of reducing labour costs and avoiding dialogue with union organisations.
The second issue is that of statutorily imposed negotiation and dispute resolution processes that are flawed and undermine the ability of unions to engage in lawful strikes.
The third issue is that of government officials turning a blind eye to companies that flagrantly violate labour laws.
And, fourthly, government officials are more prone to side with employers than workers in interpreting, or indeed ignoring, labour law violations.
Child labour widespread: Hundreds of thousands of girls in Indonesia, some as young as 11, are employed as domestic workers.
Many work long hours, with no days off, and are forbidden to leave the house where they work.
In the worst cases, girls are physically, psychologically and sexually abused.
Indonesia's labour law excludes all domestic workers from the basic labour rights afforded to most workers.
Employer retaliation for strike actions: On 16 April, 700 Federation of Indonesian Metalworkers Union (FSPMI) union workers at PT Toshiba Consumer Products Indonesia in East Jakarta Industrial Park went on strike after the company refused to implement the collective labour agreement (CBA) signed by the union and management.
After the strike, the company sent a letter to all employees saying that those who took part in the strike action would be terminated, and later shut down production and stopped health insurance coverage to all strikers.
On 5 May, police and 30 hired thugs attacked strikers outside the company gates.
The company also dismissed 15 elected trade union leaders.
On 22 August, FSPMI and Toshiba resolved the dispute with the signing of a CBA and an agreement to reinstate 697 workers, but not the 15 local union leaders.
On 10 March, laid-off workers from the manufacturing company PT Mulia Industrindo demonstrated at the Manpower and Transmigration Ministry in South Jakarta.
Mulia Industrindo dismissed about 500 workers without severance pay after they went on strike in February.
On 9 June, about 1,700 workers from polyester and textile manufacturer PT Susila Indah Fiber Industries, in Tangerang, Banten, also went on strike after they failed to reach an agreement with the company's management over several issues, including union recognition and wages that were below the minimum salary.
In addition, the company had suspended three workers for their involvement in labor protests in Jakarta on 1 May.
Rare justice for workers: In February, the International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF) reported that Fathoni Prawata, a local manager of electronic component manufacturer PT Kim Jim Pasuruan (KJI), had been sentenced to 18 months in prison in a court case brought by the Federation of Indonesian Metalworkers Union (FSPMI).
FSPMI lodged the case after Prawata unfairly dismissed FSPMI members and refused to pay wages, bonuses and leave to workers who demonstrated during negotiations for a collective agreement.
According to FSPMI President Said Iqbal, this is the first time Indonesian courts have found management official guilty of violating ILO Convention 98 and Indonesian Labour Law 21.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Iraq
In 2009, as in previous years, the Iraqi authorities directly interfered in the affairs of trade unions and attempted to repress and punish union activity.
There was a wave of strikes and protests during the year, and in November Majeed Sahib Kareem, internal relations secretary of the General Federation of Iraqi Workers (GFIW), was murdered by a car bomb.
The government tried to take control of the teachers union while several oil workers and unionists were detained and questioned.
The current legal framework is not conducive to trade union activities, and public sector workers have no trade union rights.
The current labour laws governing trade union rights are in dire need of reform.
A draft Labour Code was made public in 2007, and although it would recognise trade unions, it contains many areas of concern: it would prohibit companies in the oil sector from cooperating with unions, would not adequately protect workers against anti-union discrimination, and would establish too high thresholds for union recognition.
Until the Labour Code is adopted, labour laws dating back to the era of Saddam Hussein remain in force.
Resolution 150 of 1987 bans all public sector workers from organising, and has changed the status of employees in state-owned enterprises to civil servants, thus depriving them of the right to organise.
It also bars all public sector workers from going on strike.
Furthermore, Decree 8750, which was introduced by the new regime in August 2005, severely limits trade union activities by prohibiting unions from holding funds, collecting dues and maintaining assets.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Only one national centre officially recognised: The only officially recognised trade union is the General Federation of Iraqi Workers (GFIW), created in September 2005 from the merger of the Iraqi Federation of Workers' Trade Unions (IFTU) (previously the only one to be officially recognised), the General Federation of Trade Unions (GFTU) and the General Federation of Iraqi Trade Unions (GFITU).
However, this limits freedom of association, as organisations such as the Federation of Workers' Councils and Unions in Iraq (FWCUI) have been refused recognition.
Restricted elections: In March, trade union elections were to be held under the legal framework inherited from the regime of Saddam Hussein.
"Law 52" prohibits workers in the public sector from forming or joining unions, and only six mainly private sector unions, all affiliated to the Iraqi Federation of Trade Unions (IFTU), were allowed to participate.
Other affiliates of the IFTU and those affiliated to other national trade union centres were excluded, as well as the three Northern Kurdish provinces.
In addition, the controversial August 2005 Order 8750 freezes all trade union assets and financial accounts.
The application of this order would only be re-assessed and possibly suspended after union elections are held, and only for those unions allowed to take part in the officially-recognised elections.
Most workers banned from union membership: Many workers are deprived of the right to organise due to the predominance of the public sector in Iraq, and the fact that public sector workers are barred from trade unions.
Sectors like banking, insurance, oil and others are overwhelmingly state-owned.
Even industrial factories are very often state-owned.
The negotiators' interview with the leader of the military operations was videotaped, but union leaders were promised that their demands would be met and the following day the sums owed to the workers were dispensed.
However, the company then issued a letter to the Ministry of Industry and Minerals insisting on the punishment of nearly 40 workers considered instigators of the demonstration.
On 2 February, four union leaders were interrogated.
One union leader, Kareem Johi Sahan, was banished from the enterprise for six months and his pay grade was lowered.
In May 2009, the company's new state manager harassed and then filed police charges against Mohammed Zaki Ibrahim, the leader of the Petrochemical Workers' Union of Basra.
Zaki was charged by police with "illegal" trade union activity and labelled as a danger to the Iraqi national economy.
The Minister of Oil, Hussien Al Shahristani, issued a memo on August 23 transferring four union leaders at the drilling company Southern Oil Company in retaliation for their union activities.
Government intervention in union elections: The Iraqi Teachers Union (ITU) reported that the government has appointed an official body with the authority to take over the union, its records and property.
The Iraqi government also listed people to be included on the union's board, ignoring the recent union elections.
Despite trade unions' protests, the government stated that the union should again hold elections but that the leadership was not allowed to stand.
The ITU had already held two national conferences since 2003 with a third emergency conference in late 2007 to elect a new president, Jasim Al lami.
The interference of the government into the internal affairs of the ITU has led to the union refusing to comply with the new elections unless the leadership is elected in an open national conference organised by the ITU.
The ITU held a national protest in central Baghdad on 21 March, but the protest was interfered with by the Iraqi security forces.
A second major protest occurred on 28 March with some 500 supporters.
Leading female unionist transferred after strike: The management of the General Company for Leather Industries (GCLI) reportedly transferred a leading union activist, Sawsan Mahmoud, to another company.
The transfer follows her leadership of an April protest against the company's failure to make outstanding payments due to workers.
The company's management, in cooperation with the Ministry of Industry and Minerals, transferred the trade union activist to Elez Company, a subsidiary of the Ministry.
Sawsan reportedly appealed to the Minister, who asked the reasons for the transfer.
The company explained it was due to her participation in the protest and incitement of workers to go on strike.
The company was also undertaking the transfer of another six workers for the same reasons.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Jamaica
Employers continue to interfere with legitimate trade union activities and attempt to dismantle unions.
The Ministry of Labour may unduly intervene to end a strike.
While basic trade union rights are recognised, some areas of concern exist in the law.
Under the 2006 Labour Relations and Industrial Disputes Act, workers have the right to create and join trade unions.
The law prohibits anti-union discrimination, and employees may not be dismissed solely for belonging to a trade union.
However, while the right to collective bargaining is guaranteed, bargaining is denied if no single union represents at least 40% of the workers, or if the union seeking recognition for collective bargaining does not obtain 50% of the votes of the total number of workers.
The right to strike is not specifically protected in law, but neither is it explicitly prohibited except for workers in essential services.
However, the Ministry of Labour has the power to refer an industrial dispute to compulsory arbitration and to terminate any strike if it is "likely to be gravely injurious to the national interest".
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Anti-union practices are preventing the creation of unions in EPZs: It is common practice in companies in EPZs to threaten workers and create pro-employer "workers' councils", which interfere in the handling of complaints but are not allowed to engage in collective bargaining on working conditions or minimum wages.
As a result, so far there are no unions at all in these zones.
Government intervention in labour disputes: As the law does not recognise the right to strike and allows the authorities to intervene to end strikes, the Ministry of Labour intervenes directly in labour disputes at some workplaces.
Union busting attempts: The National Workers Union (NWU) accused the management at the Grand Palladium Resort and Spa of intimidating the workers and employing anti-union tactics to discourage them from voting for union representation.
According to the NWU, management tried to sweet talk the employees by offering them improved fringe benefits as well as attractive loans.
The union also held that attempts were made to block senior managers from joining the NWU.
The union was forced to postpone the ballot due to the interference by the management.
Irish labour law has developed according to a British-style voluntarist model.
The traditional view accepted by lawyers and industrial relations practitioners and actors was that the law should adopt an abstentionist role in relation to collective bargaining and industrial action, while supporting the individual employment relationship with a safety net of rights and obligations.
In general, the law was not used to impose employment conditions, other than the basic minima in such areas as protection from unfair dismissal, organisation of working time, employment equality and occupational safety and health.
However, changed economic and political conditions in the 1980s shattered this voluntarist consensus.
Growing pressure from both employers and unions, political concern at addressing the perceived inflationary result of free collective bargaining, and the increased intervention of the EC in regulating the individual employment relationship all contributed to this change.
As a result, labour law has become increasingly regulated, both at collective and individual level (see below).
Legislation on individual labour relations - A whole range of Acts, most deriving from EU Directives, now provide different forms of employment protection to individual employees.
The most important of these are:
The Industrial Relations Act 1990 regulates industrial action.
Collective bargaining is governed not by legislation but by a series of nationally-negotiated pay agreements based upon a social partnership model.
Every three years the Government, representatives of the trade union movement, of employers' organisations and more recently also drawn from the non-governmental 'social pillar' (ie voluntary groups) come together to negotiate a national agreement which fixes wage increases and other payments generally.
The agreement also sets a framework for a wide range of government policies, ranging from, for example, education to national infrastructural development.
The most recent is the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness (PPF) .
Collective agreements: again these are of increasing importance.
Although traditionally, collective agreements did not have any binding legal effect, this is now changing: for example under the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 collective agreements may be used to provide for legally enforceable mechanisms for compensatory rest arrangements.
It is also common practice, particularly in employments where there is trade union representation for the parties to conclude a collective agreement, regarding terms, conditions, work practices and rules of employment, which applies to all employees in membership of the union.
However, as collective agreements are not legally binding they cannot be enforced as such, for example before a tribunal.
In order to bind the individual employer and the employee the collective agreement must be specfically incorporated into the contract of employment of each employee.
Most contracts of employment are unlimited i.e.
they do not specify an end-date.
Fixed-term contracts of employment are generally treated the same way as unlimited contracts, except that they are subject to special rules about termination as, subject to certain conditions, they are exempted from the provisions of the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977-93.
In other words, the parties can agree, subject to formalities, to "contract out" of the Act where fixed term or specific purpose contracts are in operation.
However, abuse of fixed term and specific purpose contracts by an employer or successive renewals on expiry designed to avoid the provisions of the Acts will entitle an employee with the requisite service to the protection of the Acts.
There are no special contracts of employment, although in the past, another type of employment relationship was deemed to exist where a person was working for the State in the civil service, for example.
Such a person was regarded as holding 'office', ie their status was not that of employee but rather of 'office-holder'.
They were seen as holding office at the will of the Executive (the Government), which could thus dismiss them at will.
The only constraint on the power to dismiss at will was that the Government had to act subject to the principles of natural justice and fair procedures.
Most contracts of employment specify a probation period of twelve months.
The Unfair Dismissals Acts do not apply until an employee has worked for twelve months, so during the probation period the employee may be dismissed at will subject to rules on fair procedures and wrongful dismissal.
Dismissal or termination is defined in the Unfair Dismissals Acts as occurring in the following situations:
An employee is always entitled to a payment in a redundancy situation.
Under the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967-91, a redundancy arises in the event of a termination of employment where an employer requires fewer employees or a lesser number of employees of a particular kind.
Redundancy can arise for a variety of reasons under the Acts.
An employer intending to make an employee redundant must give the employee at least 2 weeks written notice (a copy of such notice must be sent to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment).
As the redundancy constitutes a termination of employment, the notice period required under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act 1973 or the Contract of Employment may be greater than 2 weeks.
On the date of dismissal the employer must give the employee the completed redundancy form (RP2) together with the lump sum payment.
Collective Agreements may also contain provisions allowing a reference to Industrial Relations mechanism, e.g.
a Conciliation Officer of the Labour Court, to make a recommendation in a dispute.
In addition, with regard to selection for redundancy or lay-off, a Collective Agreement or even a Contract of Employment may outline the procedure to be adopted in selection.
A typical arrangement would include selection on the basis of seniority, all things being equal and having regard to the needs, skills and dictates (commercial considerations) of the business.
Where the Act does apply, it requires full exchange of information and consultation with 'employees' representatives' concerned, and also for consultation with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.
Employers are required to hold consultations with 'employees' representatives' at the earliest opportunity, or at least 30 days before the first redundancy is implemented.
'Employees' representatives' mean a trade union or staff association or a person or persons chosen by the employees likely to be affected by the redundancies to represent them.
The employer is obliged to provide the representatives with all information in writing in relation to the proposed redundancies, including the reason/s for the redundancies, the number proposed to be made redundant and the criteria to be used.
The same notice period and information applies to the employer's obligation to notify the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.
An employer who does not comply with the statutory consultation process shall be guilty of an offence and may be fined up to 635 Euros.
The Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Act 1993 now provides that the Tribunal should specify the reasons they have adopted a particular form of redress as against others.
The Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Act 1993 now provides that the Tribunal (the Employment Appeals Tribunal) should specify the reasons they have adopted a particular form of redress as against others.
In practice, compensation is the remedy most commonly awarded (in approximately 75% of successful claims).
Re-engagement and re-instatement are much less common remedies due to a number of factors.
In some cases, the employee may have already obtained alternative employment.
In others, relations between employer and employee may have broken down to the extent that the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be reluctant to enforce the resumption of a working relationship.
Finally, even where the employee succeeds in claiming unfair dismissal, there may be some element of contributory behaviour by the employee to the events leading to the dismissal and in those cases, again, the Employment Appeals Tribunal is reluctant to order that the employee be re-engaged or re-instated.
For all these reasons, compensation is far more routinely awarded as a remedy.
Certain categories of office holders and employees of the State (e.g.
Gardai, Defence Forces) excluded from the legislation may seek redress for dismissal in the ordinary courts.
Two options may be available - an action for wrongful dismissal (this option is open to any employee as an alternative to a claim under the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977-1993), or judicial review of the decision to dismissal seeking a court order quashing the dismissal (an order of certiorari).
Such an action will usually be based on a failure by the employer to comply with the tenets of natural justice.
These principles include the right to be fully informed of the complaint, the right to respond with the benefit of adequate time and information to prepare and adequate representation.
In Al Mutari .v.
Midland Health Board (1988 High Court) a senior House Officer in St. Fintans Hospital was granted a declaration by the High Court that his dismissal was null and void where there had been a failure by the Health Board to comply with the principles of nature justice.In Gunn .v.
National College of Art & Design (Supreme Court 1988) the Supreme Court set aside doubts as to whether employees who were not office holders were entitled to the protection of the principles of natural justice.
In his judgement Justice Walsh indicated that the application of the rules of natural justice do not depend on the status of the person, office holder or employee of another kind.
"The quality of justice does not depend on such distinctions".
However, it should be noted that where there is clear agreement (a contract/collective agreement) or specific statutory provisions which govern disciplinary and dismissal procedures, the fairness or otherwise of the procedures adopted will be judged on the basis of the terms and provisions of the agreement or statute as applicable.
Working Time is regulated by the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.
Under this act the hours of work are limited to 48 hours per week, subject to certain exceptions.
However, the average or standard working time may be lower, and it actually varies in the different sectors.
Collective agreements normally address this issue, as well as overtime.
The 1994 Act continues the pattern of extending the scope of employment legislation to include atypical workers, as exemplified in the Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Act 1993 and the Terms of Employment (Information) Act 1994.
Under the provisions of the previous Maternity Act 1981, fixed term employees engaged for periods of less than 26 weeks or with less than 26 weeks to run on their contract were excluded from protection.
Such employees now have full protection for the term of their contract.
There are no service qualifications for employees as a prerequisite for protection under the Act.
Employees engaged on a probationary period, trainees and Apprentices fall within the ambit of the Act, as do employees engaged through the services of an employment agency.
Section 2(2)(c) provides that, for the purposes of the Act, the person liable to pay the wages of an employee engaged through an employment agency shall be deemed to be the employer.
Officers and servants of the State, including members of the Garda Siochana and Defence Forces, and all other employees of the State, are not excluded from the legislation and are deemed to be employees within the meaning of the Act.
Where health and safety leave is granted, section 18(4) of the 1994 Act obliges the employer to pay the employee's remuneration for a period of 21 days in any relevant period.
On the level of remuneration and the manner of its payment, Regulation 3 of the Maternity Protection (Health and Safety Leave Remuneration) Regulations 1995 obliges the employer to pay an amount equal to three times the employee's normal weekly pay.
There is no payment in respect of weekend days not normally worked, although Saturdays and Sundays are counted in the calculation that goes to make up the 21 days.
The definition of normal weekly pay excludes any payments /remuneration or allowance in respect of overtime, night work, shift work, unsocial hours or an employee being available "on call".
Where the employee is paid at a fixed rate, i.e.
a fixed salary, weekly wage, allowance, daily/hourly rate, in relation to fixed hours she should be entitled to 3 weeks' remuneration at that rate excluding any amount attributable to overtime.
The reference period for establishing the rate of pay is the last week worked prior to the grant of health and safety leave.
Where a fixed allowance is paid monthly or quarterly it must be apportioned on a pro rata basis.
Where an employee is not paid at a fixed rate, say for example a commission-based employee, to calculate the 21-day remuneration the reference period is the remuneration earned in the previous 26-week period, the employee's weekly rate being equal to one-26th of her total remuneration in the 26-week period.
Leave for trade union purposes or because of the holding of public office
Beyond this age and so far as a worker is aged less than 18 years old he or she are protected under the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996.
This law provides for minimum rest and break periods for young persons and children.
It also establishes strict limits to night work for children and young persons, and it obliges employers to ensure that young people have working conditions which suit their age, including protection against economic exploitation.
Also, employers are obliged to ensure that young persons are not engaged in work likely to harm safety, health or development/education.
The boundaries in this area were extended with the decision in A Limited Company v. One Female Employee, a case involving a residential training programme that took place in a hotel away from the workplace.
2 The claimant had returned to her hotel room to find it ransacked and her personal belongings littered in a sexually disturbing and suggestive manner.
Fellow employees from senior management positions had been responsible for what they described as a 'prank'.
The Equality Officer considered that the events constituted discrimination within the meaning of the Act.
It was therefore established that harassment may occur outside the work place, and that in order to constitute actionable discrimination, it need not be overt or physical but can manifest itself in a more subtle manner.
'Remuneration' is defined to include all consideration, in cash or kind, except pension rights.
It would include company cars, lunch vouchers, or an overtime allowance.
The 'same place' requirement is removed.
(c) work that is equal in value, having regard to skill, mental or physical requirements, responsibility and working conditions.
In relation to grounds other than gender, section 34(1) provides that benefits may still be provided by employers in respect of changes in marital status; events related to the family of the employee; or to assist in the care of dependants for those employees with family status.
Section 34(6) also provides that a further period of 3 years after section 29 of the Act has come into force is allowed for any existing practice of age-related remuneration to cease; and that in any case it is not regarded as age-based discrimination to pay different rates according to seniority or length of service.
The National Minimum Wage Act, 2000 came into effect on April 1, 2000 and introduced a National Minimum Wage for the first time in Ireland.
Many low paid workers benefited from its introduction, particularly women, young people and part-time workers.
An increase in the National Minimum Wage came into effect on July 1, 2001, the first of two increases to the national minimum wage agreed by the social partners and accepted by the Government as part of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness (PPF).
The National Minimum Wage is now £4.70 (€5.97) per hour.
From October 1, 2002 it will increase to £5.00 (€6.35) per hour.
Wages are fixed through a series of nationally-negotiated pay agreements based upon a social partnership model.
Every three years the Government, representatives of the trade union movement, of employers' organisations and more recently also drawn from the non-governmental 'social pillar' (ie voluntary groups) come together to negotiate a national agreement which fixes wage increases and other payments generally.
The agreement also sets a framework for a wide range of government policies, ranging from, for example, education to national infrastructural development.
The most recent of these is the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness (PPF).
Employees' rights are protected in the event of insolvency in that any money owing to them by the employer in terms of remuneration, holiday pay, sick pay, monies in lieu of notice, or money owing under any recommendation or order made against the employer in respect of unfair dismissal, maternity or parental leave claims.
Pension payments are also covered subject to a ceiling and time limits.
The employee may be designated as a preferred creditor although debts owed to them rank behind the expenses of the liquidator or receiver, and any taxes owing to the Revenue Commissioners.
In any event, the employee may apply to the Minister on the prescribed form and the Minister shall pay the debts owed, once the Minister is satisfied that the employee falls within the definition of theAct and the employer has become insolvent after 22 October 1983; and that on the 'relevant date' the employee was entitled to be paid the whole or part of any debt.
The pattern favoured in the law throughout much of the last century was apparent from the two major pieces of legislation regulating trade union structures and organisation passed in Irish law prior to the last decade: the Trade Union Act 1941 and the Industrial Relations Act 1946.
The 1941 Act, as subsequently amended, was concerned primarily with the problem of multiplicity of unions, seeking to tackle it by discouraging the formation of new trade unions and encouraging the merger of existing ones.
The 1946 Act was concerned more generally with industrial relations, enshrining the principle of free collective bargaining, ensuring that the State's role in the collective bargaining process remained an auxiliary one.
Since the commencement of the national centralised 'social partnership' process, the State's role in collective bargaining has clearly increased significantly.
But in terms of trade union pattern, the policy remains one of discouraging a multiplicity of unions.
In 1980 trade union density (the percentage of those in employment who were union members) stood at 61.8%.
By 1990 this figure had shrunk to an estimated 54.6%.
Today the comparable figure is either 39.2% using figures from the ICTU or 42.05% based on LRC data.
Using either set of figures we can see that union density has dropped by 50%, from 60% of the workforce to 40%.
In the private sector union density stands at around 28%, or just over a quarter of the 1m workers employed by private sector companies.
This downward trend in trade union membership is not unique to Ireland.
Recent data published in the European Journal of Industrial Relations (Vol.
6 No.
2 July 2000) shows the picture across Europe.
In looking at these figures, it should also be remembered that in many European countries many more employees than are union members are covered by collectively negotiated agreements because of the sectoral or national application of such agreements, often by law.
From an Irish trade union perspective, what is worrying about the membership figures is that union density is decreasing during a period of strong employment growth.
In the past, union membership and density has tended to increase during robust periods of economic growth.
If present trends continue, then within the next five years union membership in the private sector will drop below 20% and could be fast approaching 15%.
Unions have not actual lost members; membership simply has not grown at the same rate as employment growth.
There are a number of reasons to explain the drop in density.
In part it derives from the decline of traditional, mass-manufacturing companies, with predominantly male workforces, which were the heartlands of the trade unions.
It has been suggested by some commentators that the density drop results almost exclusively from the failure of the trade unions to build membership in the new growth sectors, such as computers, informational technology, telecommunications and financial services, especially in overseas companies investing in this country.
The case of Meskell v CIE [1973] IR 121 held that to try to alter the constitutional rights of an employee retrospectively by enforcing a closed shop agreement on current employees was unconstitutional.
This decision did not affect the rights of workers who join an employment which already has a pre-entry closed shop agreement, as the employee will know in advance that trade union membership of a particular union is an employment requirement.
Such a condition of employment is not regarded as unconstitutional as neither compulsion nor coercion on the employee is involved - though it has to be said that these contentions have not been fully tested in the Courts.
Although many types of unions exist, from in-house staff associations to national bodies, and registration/authorisation is not obligatory, there are certain advantages to be gained from being an authorised trade union, particularly since the enactment of the Industrial Relations Act 1990.
That Act provides for certain immunities from liability for trade unions involved in trade disputes, but these apply only in relation to 'authorised trade unions which for the time being are holders of negotiation licences under the Trade Union Act, 1941.
'The 1941 Act provides for various restrictions on the granting and retention of such licences, which are designed to hinder any attempts to create new unions.
The restrictions vary in accordance with the category of union to which the applicant union belongs.
The legal situation with regard to trade union recognition is that an employer does not have to recognise or bargain with a union.
Nevertheless, the Courts have held that disputes over recognition are valid trade disputes.
The Industrial Relations Act 1990 gives disputes over recognition immunity from “action in relation to any torturous act committed by or on behalf of the trade union in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute”, provided they comply with certain stated statutory requirements.
Trade union membership and recognition is an important issue in Ireland, particularly because Irish legislation contains no erga omnes provisions whereby collective bargaining agreements are applied across sectors on a binding basis.
Therefore, in Ireland, collective bargaining coverage is synonymous with union membership.
As union density currently stands at around 40% (broken down as between around 80% in the public sector and 25% in the private sector) this means that around 60% of Irish workers have their pay and conditions unilaterally set by management, or as a result of individual negotiations.
Further, because of the fact that the Irish Labour Inspectorate (which is seriously understaffed) operates on a reactive basis – i.e.
they respond largely to complaints rather than proactively inspecting employers to ensure that employment laws are being adhered to – workers who, in theory, appear to be well protected, in reality may be inadequately protected or not protected at all.
The concept of unfair labour practices does not exist as such.
However, through the employment legislation detailed above employers are obliged to act fairly towards their employees in a range of different ways.
The Labour Relations Commission has published a range of Codes setting out best practice in different areas, for example on disciplinary and grievance procedures.
The Trade Union Act 1941 identifies the primary function of a trade union as the carrying on of negotiations for the fixing of wages and other conditions of employment - the carrying on of such negotiations with employers is known as collective bargaining.
Since the foundation of the State, with the exception of the limited period 1941-46 and certain temporary legislation with respect to the banks in 1973, 1975 and 1976, trade unions and employers have been free to bargain over wages and other conditions of employment without the intervention of the law.
These Agreements or Programmes are negotiated at a national level, but local agreements may still be reached, and this is generally done informally.
At present, local collective agreements are not binding due to the policy of voluntarism or exclusion of the courts, which is central to collective bargaining and industrial relations practice in Ireland.
Whereas it is possible for collective agreements to be registered with the Labour Court, they seldom are in practice.
If it is desired, then the parties to a Collective Agreement may apply to the Labour Court to register the Agreement.
Once the Agreement is registered and any subsequent amendments notified, the Agreement is legally enforceable.
At national level: the Government, representatives of the trade union movement, of employers' organisations and more recently also drawn from the non-governmental 'social pillar' (ie voluntary groups).
These are informal, and are not regulated by law.
However, the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 gives a more formalised role for collective agreements, allowing flexibility to be reached in the application of the Act through the negotiation of collective agreements.
For example, the normal reference period over which the maximum 48-hour working week is calculated is 6 months, but this can instead be calculated over 12 months, where an employer concludes a collective agreement with the workforce, which is approved and registered by the Labour Court under section 24 of the Act.
Collective agreements also allow greater flexibility in the scheduling of daily and weekly rest breaks, and the management of night work.
The Act thus gives greater importance to collective agreements, but technically speaking, collective agreements do not provide a way around the Act.
Instead, they may provide for more flexibility within the operation of the Act.
Section 2(1) defines collective agreement.
"an agreement by or on behalf of an employer on the one hand, and by or on behalf of a body or bodies representative of the employees to whom the agreement relates on the other hand.
"
Thus, they do not have to be union-employer agreements.
They may be concluded between an employer and an internal staff association.
The procedure for concluding ‘flexibility’ collective agreements is provided for under section 24 of the Act, as follows:
Collective agreements are generally not binding on the parties.
The terms of an agreement may, however, be binding on the workers and employers included within the agreement's scope but only to the extent that they are deemed to have been 'incorporated' into the employees' individual contracts of employment.
Representation of workers is either organised through trade unions, or organised on an informal basis, or not organised at all.
Until EU legislation comes into effect, there is no obligation on the employer to have a mechanism for the representation of workers in Irish law.
The legal framework for strike action is made up by a combination of law, collective agreements and case law or a combination.
The Industrial Relations Act 1990 is now the governing statute in this area, and has been in force since July 1990.
The objective of the Act was to reform the law in relation to trade disputes and Industrial Relation Institutions - to create a better framework/climate for dispute resolution and to incorporate some amendments in relation to trade union Law.
Prior to the 1990 Act, the right to strike and the law pursuant to Trade disputes was enshrined in the Trade Disputes Act 1906.
This Act granted certain legal immunities to persons engaged in a lawful trade dispute.
These immunities are, to a large extent, preserved in the 1990 Act - the changes are designed to place observance of certain procedures as a precondition before the legal immunities will apply.
Section12 provides immunity to persons acting in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute in relation to actions for breach of contract of employment, inducement to others to breach their contact or a threat to breach the contract of employment (a threatened strike).
Section13 provides immunity for actions in Tort (civil wrong) against Trade Unions, members of and Trade Union Officials provided their actions were taken in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute or with reasonable belief that they were in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute.
Anyone may convene a strike, but the protection against liability only applies to trade unions which convene a strike under certain procedural requirements imposed upon unions by the Act, with regard to taking lawful strike action.
Sections 14 and 19 of the Act require trade unions to ballot members in a secret ballot before organising or sanctioning industrial action in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute.
If such ballot favours industrial action the union must give the employer one week notice of the intention to take industrial action.
If the union complies with this requirement the employer is precluded from seeking an ex pate (interim) injunction.
The employer may still apply for an interlocutory injunction but section 19(2) provides that the Court will not grant the injunction where the Union establishes a fair case that they were acting in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute.
These protections are not available if the trade union fails to comply with the secret ballot and notice requirements and the detailed requirements in section 4(2), as follows:
Section 9 of the Industrial Relations Act 1990 would appear to deprive employees of the immunity against suit and protection against an injunction in relation to picketing where certain conditions apply.
If the dispute is in relation to the employment/non-employment or conditions of employment of an individual and the employee(s)/union involved have not exhausted all the procedures established by custom and practice or detailed in a Collective Agreement in relation to the processing of industrial grievances.
This would appear to require an individual employee to process a dispute in relation to dismissal right through to the E.A.T.
before industrial action could be taken with the protections.
The employer however is also obliged to adhere to procedures - section9(3) provides that where the employer refuses to comply with procedures, the employee will be deemed to have exhausted such procedures.
With regard to trade disputes which are not individual worker disputes, the Act is silent as to whether the union or the employees must exhaust procedures set down in a Collective Agreement before strike action is taken.
Certainly they must comply with the secret ballot/notice requirements.
However, it would also appear that if a Collective Agreement is incorporated into an individual employees contract and is thereby legally enforceable or is a Registered agreement the immunities in sections 12/S.13 may not be available if the action was taken without firstly exhausting the agreed dispute procedures in the Collective Agreement.
Lockouts are not included in the definition of "strike" or "industrial action" under the Industrial Relations Act 1990, so are not regulated at the collective level.
Rather, they are regulated at the individual employee level, under the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977-93.
If at the end of a lockout, an employee is not reinstated or re-engaged, and one or more others who were also locked out were reinstated or re-engaged, it would then be considered an unfair dismissal.
The 1993 Act amended the 1977 Act to provide that the dismissal of an employee for taking part in a strike or industrial action is an unfair dismissal if at least one other employee was not dismissed for the same action, or if another employee was reinstated or re-engaged.
The date of reinstatement or re-engagement is the date as agreed between the employer and employees, or if there is no agreement, the date on which reinstatement or re-engagement was offered to the majority of the workforce.
If a particular employee is dismissed for taking part in a strike and other employees are not so dismissed, it would be an automatically unfair dismissal.
However, if during the course of the strike or other industrial action, there was abusive behaviour by an employee, he or she could be deemed to be fairly dismissed for that reason.
Labour law matters are generally not dealt with through the ordinary courts structures, but rather through a specialist structure of labour institutions: the Labour Relations Commission, Rights Commissioners, the Director of Equality Investigations, the Labour Court and the Employment Appeals Tribunal.
Although labour law is often divided between collective and individual branches, this division is not reflected in the functions reserved to each of the labour institutions.
The Labour Court, for example, was set up as a collective and voluntarist institution with a primary role in resolving trade disputes; but it has more recently been assigned jurisdiction over equality law matters and hears appeals from the Director of Equality Investigations under the Employment Equality Act 1998.
Claims involving breaches of other employment protection legislation such as the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977-93, the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 or the Payment of Wages Act 1991 are all taken first to the Rights Commissioner and then to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.
The Irish Labour Court was established in 1946 (following the enactment of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946).
Its main functions were to adjudicate in trade disputes and to provide a conciliation service.
Other functions given to the Court included the establishment of Joint Labour Committees and the registration of employment agreements and Joint Industrial Councils.
There have been many changes to its structure and functions since then, following amendments to the Industrial Relations Act in 1969, 1976, 1990 and 2001, and the enactment of other laws, such as the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, the Employment Equality Act, 1977, the Pensions Act, 1990, the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, the Employment Equality Act, 1998, the National Minimum Wage Act, 2000, the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act, 2001.
An equality service was added in 1975 to deal with equal pay - and later, equal treatment - cases.
In 1991, this service, and the conciliation service of the Labour Court were transferred to the Labour Relations Commission.
In 1999, the equality service was transferred from the Labour Relations Commission to the newly formed Equality Authority and Office of the Director of Equality Investigations, (under the auspices of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform) under the Employment Equality Act, 1998.
The Labour Relations Commission (LRC) was established on 21 January, 1991 under section 24 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990.
The LRC is made up of a chairperson and six ordinary members, of whom two are appointed by the Minister, two come from the workers sides and two from employers’ side.
The chairman shall be appointed by the Minister after consultation with such organisations as the Minister considers to be representative of workers and of employers.
In addition to Senior Management, LRC’s staff includes industrial relations officers (conciliation officers), rights commissioners and advisory, development and research officers.
Conciliation is a voluntary process.
The process of conciliation begins when one or both disputing parties writes to the Labour Relations Commission requesting assistance with their industrial relations dispute.
According to LRCs data, conciliation is succesful in over 80 per cent of cases that are referred to it for conciliation.
In case of failure the parties have the option of referring the dispute to the Labour Court for recommendation.
Rights Commissioners investigate disputes, grievances and claims that individuals or small groups of workers refer under various pieces of legislation, such as the Industrial Relations Act, 1969-1990, the Unfair Dismissals Acts,1977 -1993 , the Payment of Wages Act, 1991, the Maternity Protection Act, 1994, the Protection of Young Persons ( Employment ) Act, 1998, the Organisation Of Working Time Act, 1997, etc.
However, a party to a dispute may object to a Rights Commissioner’s investigation where the case has been referred under the Industrial Relations Acts, 1969-1990 or under the Unfair Dismissals Acts, 1977-1993.
Where such an objection is made, the Rights Commissioner cannot investigate the case.
The applicant can instead request the Labour Court or, depending on the legislation, the Employment Appeals Tribunal to hear the case.
The Employment Appeals Tribunal is responsible for implementing rights under protective employment law.
It hears a wide range of disputes concerning employment rights.
It consists of three people: a Chairperson who has legal qualifications and one representative each from panels formed by the trade unions and employer organisations.
Under the Unfair Dismissals Act and the Maternity Protection of Employees Act, either party may appeal to the Circuit Court within 6 weeks of the determination (the appeal is not confined to a point of law).
If no appeal is brought to the Circuit Court and the employer does not implement the determination, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment may bring proceedings in the Circuit Court on behalf of the employee.
2009 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Japan
The Civil Service Reform Law was enacted on 13 June 2008, but strong legal restrictions on government employees' trade union rights remained in place, including the ban on public sector strikes.
The Constitution recognises workers' freedom of association and their right to organise, bargain and act collectively.
There are limitations, however, particularly for civil service employees and, to a lesser extent, for employees of state-run companies and private companies that are considered to have "higher social responsibility", i.e., those that provide essential services.
There are significant differences in laws governing the trade union rights of private sector workers and public sector employees.
Legislation: There are three major labour laws governing private sector workers, including foreign workers, two of which have a direct bearing on their trade union rights.
The Trade Union Law (TUL) guarantees the right to organise and bargain collectively, and the Labour Relations Adjustment Law (LRAL) covers dispute settlements.
The third law, the Labour Standards Law (LSL), governs working conditions.
Right to strike: The right to strike is protected in the private sector.
However, for private companies operating in sectors designated as providing services that are essential for public daily life, the union must give ten days' advance notice to the authorities.
Currently this restriction applies to businesses involving electric power generation and transmission, transportation and railways, telecommunications services and medical care and public health.
It has also applied to the postal service since October 2007, when the service was privatised.
Collective bargaining: Collective bargaining is very strong in Japan.
Although the TUL provides for regional collective agreements, in practice they are mostly enterprise-based.
During the "Spring Struggle", union representatives meet with management to determine working conditions including wages.
Loophole in the law – fixed-term employment contracts: The LSL stipulates that fixed-term contracts can be concluded for up to three years (and in exceptional cases up to five years is allowed for professionals).
Employers frequently use this system in order to circumvent the legal provisions protecting workers on permanent contracts from dismissal.
There are increasing numbers of workers who are hired on a contractual basis, undermining regular employment and causing greater obstacles to unions seeking to organise workers.
Short-term contracts are often renewed rather than converted into permanent contracts.
Moreover, the working conditions of fixed-term contract workers are inferior, mainly because there is a lack of legislation prohibiting discriminatory treatment based on different forms of employment.
The Revised Part-Time Work Law, which came into force on 1 April 2008, prohibits discriminatory treatment of part-time workers, but the categories of workers protected by the law are very limited, and most part-timers are not included in those categories.
Heavy restrictions: Labour relations in Japan's public service are governed by the National Public Service Law and the Local Public Service Law, dating back to 1948, which both heavily restrict basic trade union rights.
The system of trade union registration for local public employees requires separate unions to be created in each municipality, which the ILO has described as "tantamount to prior authorisation" to form unions.
Administrative and clerical workers do not have the right to bargain or conclude collective agreements at the local or national level.
Their wages are set by law and/or regulations, partly based on recommendations issued by the NPA (National Personnel Authority) and local personnel commissions.
Strikes banned: All public employees are banned from striking.
Trade union leaders who incite strike action in the public sector can be dismissed and fined or imprisoned for up to three years under provisions of the National Public Service Law and the Local Public Service Law.
Government intransigence on trade union rights for public sector workers: Over the years, the Japanese government has repeatedly ignored ILO Committee on Freedom of Association (CFA) recommendations that it amend its legislation to remove the restrictions on public sector workers' rights and bring them into line with international standards.
Enactment of the Civil Service Reform Law: The Civil Service Reform Law was enacted on 13 June 2008 with the provision that "the Government of Japan should show the people the whole picture of the reform, including the benefits and costs of expanding the scope of public employees with the right to conclude collective agreements, and with the understanding of the people, take measures for establishing a transparent and autonomous labour-management relations system.
" Based on the provisions of the Reform Law, the Headquarters for Promoting Civil Service Reform was established in the Cabinet of the Prime Minister, and the Labour-Employer Relations System Review Committee was created under the Headquarters.
The Review Committee was charged with researching and examining measures to be taken by the government to establish an autonomous labour-management relations system for civil service employees.
Though it was set the task of studying how to design a concrete system for ensuring that civil service employees are granted fundamental labour rights, the Review Committee has not yet carried out that study.
Fundamental labour rights in Independent Administrative Institutions (IAIs): The government has transformed public agencies into IAIs, which it defines as "organisationally independent from the government".
Two types of IAIs have been created: "specified IAIs" and "non-specified IAIs".
While the government maintains that all IAI employees have the right to organise and bargain collectively, only workers in non-specified IAIs are guaranteed the right to strike.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2008
Changes in the employment relationship causing growing difficulties for union organising and activities: The number of "non-regular workers" including part-timers, indirectly employed workers engaging in temporary work through agencies or in contract work through contracting companies, and individuals who work on a contract basis and are not considered employees under current laws, is growing.
The Labour Force Survey conducted by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications found that 34.5 per cent of all employees were non-regular workers in the period between July and September 2008.
Diversification of types of enterprise: The Supreme Court ruled that an entity can only be considered an employer when "such an entity is in a position to actually determine workers' essential working conditions" through direct involvement.
In most cases, holding companies or investment fund companies (which are very common in Japan) are only indirectly involved in influencing the decisions on working conditions of their shareholding companies.
Hence, they are not considered as employers in law, and it is difficult for trade unions to conduct collective bargaining with holding companies or investment fund companies.
Abuse of "trainee visa" system for sweatshop labour: Employers also abuse the Industrial Training Programme (ITP) and Technical Internship Programme (TIP), which provide three-year visas for unskilled foreign workers to come to Japan to be trained.
Despite promises of being provided training in technological skills, many of the tens of thousands of foreign workers who come to Japan end up in sweatshops, forced to work long hours in dangerous conditions for as little as half the minimum wage.
Employers additionally deprive them of their work permits and deny them their right to form a union and bargain collectively.
In many cases, employment agencies which provide foreign workers or companies from the sending countries also abuse the system and exploit the workers through inferior employment contracts.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Jordan
Union activity is tightly controlled.
Union activists and strikers face discrimination and in the case of migrants' deportation.
Throughout 2009, strikes and protests by migrant workers were brutally broken up by baton-wielding police.
Changes to the labour law giving migrants more protection and labour rights have not yet had an impact.
A single trade union system is in place, and it is prohibitively difficult to call a lawful strike.
Although the law recognises some trade union rights, those remain limited.
Workers in private companies and in some public corporations have the right to form trade unions.
However, freedom of association is hampered by the requirement that all unions belong to the General Federation of Jordanian Trade Unions (GFJTU).
Furthermore, fifty founding members are required to establish a union, and approval by the Ministry of Labour is required for it to become officially registered.
New trade unions must also be directly linked to 17 professions and sectors in which unions already exist, which effectively makes trade union pluralism impossible.
Civil servants, as well as gardeners and cooks, are not covered by the Labour Code, and non-citizens are denied the right to form or join trade unions.
Furthermore, the right to collective bargaining is not recognised, however there is a chapter on collective agreements in the Labour Code.
The right to strike is heavily curtailed, as government permission must be obtain in order to call a lawful strike.
The Ministry of Labour can also impose cumbersome mediation or refer the case to a labour court.
Alternatively, the dispute is transferred to the Council of Ministers and then to Parliament.
Strikes are prohibited during the dispute resolution procedures.
A draft law was submitted by the Government to the Council of Ministers, which has not been approved yet.
This law would regulate the recruitment and employment of non-Jordanian labourers as well as allowing them to join trade unions.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Migrant workers abused: In August 2008, amendments to the Labour Law stated that domestic workers are to be treated on equal footing with Jordanian workers in terms of medical care, timely payment of wages and subscription to the Social Security Corporation.
However for most foreign domestic workers the situation has not yet changed and several cases of abuse came to light throughout 2009.
2009 official figures showed that more than 322,000 migrants are working in Jordan but that unofficial estimates put unregistered migrant workers at 100,000-150,000.
Many are employed without the proper permits, have their passports taken and are forced to work extremely long hours.
The Textile Union has been following up with the Ministry of Labour about the workers' situations; 85 of the workers wanted to return home, while 56 had work permits that had just expired.
However, the Minister of Labour has announced that the workers are only entitled to 22 days pay and unused vacation leave because the strike was illegal.
Garment workers – beaten and deported for striking: Reports emerged of abuse of migrant workers in various companies including the Israeli owned Musa Garment Factory.
Workers at the Musa factory complained of forced overtime, beatings, insufficient food, the illegal withholding of passports and other abuses amounting to conditions of forced labour.
However, when workers protested they were instead beaten by police, arrested and then deported to their home countries just days after assurances from the Ministry of labour that no action would be taken against them for six months pending an investigation.
Several remained in prison.
Negotiations to end the dispute, mediated by Mazen Ma'aytah, general secretary of the General Federation of Jordanian Trade Unions, and monitored by the International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF) led to a guarantee – for the first time – that workers have the right to belong to their own elected union.
Government also offered a pay package that met the workers' demands.
2008 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Jordan
Restrictions on Jordanian workers' trade union rights, including the continued single union system, continue, and there are fears that a new law could restrict freedom of association.
Migrant workers were beaten during a strike in the QIZs, and others were threatened with dismissal.
Foreign domestic workers have gained rights.
Obstacles to freedom of association: Workers employed in private companies and in some public corporations have the right to form trade unions.
However, there are many obstacles to freedom of association.
Trade unions must obtain Ministry of Labour approval in order to become officially registered, and registration is directly linked to 17 professions and sectors in which trade unions already exist, making trade union pluralism effectively impossible.
Unions are required to be members of the General Federation of Jordanian Trade Unions (GFJTU), which is the only trade union federation.
The government subsidises the GFJTU's wages and some of its activities, audits its accounts and monitors its activities and its elections.
New law threatens freedom of association: There was concern that a new law being discussed in the Parliament at the end of the year on limiting freedom of association for nongovernmental organisations could extend to trade unions.
The bill would forbid NGOs from becoming a member of a partner of a foreign NGO and would place limits on its funding.
Right to strike heavily curtailed: The right to strike is considerably limited by the fact that permission must be obtained from the government before a strike can take place.
The Ministry of Labour can also impose cumbersome mediation or, if that fails to reach a settlement, it can refer the case to a labour court that consists of a panel of judges appointed by the Ministry.
Its decisions are binding.
Both parties must agree to court action, or else the Ministry will transfer the case to the Council of Ministers and then the Parliament.
Strikes are prohibited during mediation and arbitration periods.
The law also prohibits employers from dismissing a worker during a labour dispute.
Strikes do take place, but without government permission, so they are deemed illegal.
Export processing zones (EPZs) and Qualified Industrial Zones (QIZs): There are a combination of free trade zones and Qualified Industrial Zones (QIZs).
Although they are subject to the national labour law, because 70% of the labour force are foreign and classed as "noncitizens", workers are not legally allowed to form or participate in unions, and as a result many suffer from very low pay and terrible conditions.
No union rights for migrant workers: Foreign workers are barred from trade union membership, collective bargaining and striking.
The unions have pressured the government to amend the labour law to allow them to join a union, without voting rights.
The proposed amendments have not yet been presented to the House of Representatives for adoption.
Trade union rights in practice and Violations in 2007
Gains by civil aviation workers: The International Transport Workers Federation-affiliated General Trade Union of Workers in Air Transport and Tourism that covers 92% of the entire royal Jordanian workforce won a deal that gives them part-ownership in the company, and maintains their rights to organise and bargain collectively.
Conditions in Qualified Industrial Zones: Following a damning report in March 2006 by the US-based National Labour Committee (NLC) describing the dreadful working conditions in the zones faced by migrant workers, the Ministry of Labour brought in a range of measures.
It increased the number of inspectors, set up a special phone line for complaints from migrant workers, fined employers and suspended the granting of visas to would-be migrants for some time.
At least seven factories were closed down.
Employees who belong to unions are covered by collective agreements negotiated by their union and the employer.
Collective agreements have as their basis the minimum standards set out in the Employment Standards Act.
All collective agreements must meet or exceed the minimum standards of the Act .
If they do not, then the Act would apply.
One of the most important protections offered by the Act is a minimum wage, which all employers are required to pay.
The minimum wage can be adjusted by regulation.
As of July 31, 2008, the minimum hourly wage was between $6 and $8.00.
Employees are allowed up to 5 days of unpaid leave to meet family responsibilities.
Severance pay is one week's wages for an employee with at least three months consecutive service; 1 week's wages for each consecutive years service after that.
In other words, for 5 years consecutive service, the severance pay would be 5 weeks' wages, but up to a maximum of eight weeks' wages.
2009 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Kenya
Despite some major reforms to the labour law, its application in practice has remained very inadequate.
It should be noted that Kenya has still not ratified Convention 87.
Employers interfered in trade union affairs.
The right to strike was flouted.
Freedom of association: The Constitution of Kenya provides the right of freedom of association to every person in Kenya and specifically recognises the freedom of association to form or belong to trade unions or other associations for the protection of the person's interests.
The Labour Relations Act (No.
14 of 2007) excludes members of the prison service from its scope, which is considered to be a violation of the principles of freedom of association.
The Labour Relations Act sets out requirements for registration of trade unions, and if registration is denied, then written reasons must be given.
The Registrar does not appear to have wide discretionary powers to refuse registration or to cancel or suspend registration of a union.
Any application for registration must be signed by at least seven members.
Any decision of the Registrar may be appealed in the Industrial Court.
Collective bargaining: The Labour Relations Act recognises collective bargaining.
A union must be recognised as a bargaining agent if it represents a simple majority of those employees eligible to become union members; this provision extends to the public sector employers.
Collective agreements must be submitted to the Industrial Court and become binding upon registration by the court.
All labour laws, including the right to organise and bargain collectively, apply in the export processing zones (EPZs).
Bargaining rights still denied to teachers and others in non-essential services: Civil servants are allowed to bargain collectively and to go on strike, but this right is still denied to workers in the military, prisons, the National Youth Service and teachers under the Teachers' Service Commission.
The Labour Relations Act provides that the Labour Minister may, after consultations with the National Labour Board, make regulations establishing machinery for determining terms and conditions of employment in the public sector, and these shall have the same effect as a registered collective agreement.
Restrictions on the right to strike: The law authorises the right to strike, but the criteria for a protected strike (or lock out) are stringent.
The dispute must relate to terms and conditions of employment or union recognition, formal conciliation procedures must have been exhausted and seven days written notice must have been provided to the other party to the dispute and the minister of labour.
The definition of "essential services" under the LRA is quite broad, as the reference is to any service the interruption of which would probably endanger the life of a person or the health of the population or any part of the population.
In addition the Minister may after consultation with the National Labour Board declare any service as an essential service in order to prohibit the right to strike.
The general prohibition on sympathy strikes imposed by the LRA is also contrary to ILO Convention 98.
Delays in finalising labour law review: Despite the enactment of the new LRA, there appears to be no further development concerning the promised reform of the Labour Code.
A government task force was formed in 2006 to revise the Labour Code to ensure conformity with ILO core labour standards and the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA).
The LRA contains no provisions relating to child labour, forced labour or discrimination and as such does not constitute a complete reform process in line with the mandate of the government task force.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2008
Employers have tended increasingly to cut their permanent staff and instead use day workers or sub-contractors, thereby reducing workers' chances of representation by trade unions, since the latter are finding it harder to get the number of members needed for obtaining official recognition.
Interference in trade union activities and intimidation: Employers have been depicting unions as incompetent organisations and trying to convince their employees not to join up, claiming that they will get higher wages that way.
Union leaders and members have been threatened with dismissal or actually sacked for participating in trade union activities.
Trade unionists have frequently had problems obtaining meetings with their employers.
Tripartite body prevented from functioning: The government twice dissolved the Executive Board of the National Social Security Fund (NSSF), a tripartite structure in which the Central Organisation of Trade Unions (COTU) is involved.
COTU denounced these unilateral decisions in breach of the NSSF Act, deploring the paralysis of a body that is vital to workers.
Obstructing the right to strike: In practice, the right to strike is frequently violated in Kenya.
During the notice period, the Minister of Labour generally intervenes and proposes a mediator for the dispute.
If the negotiations break down, the government usually refers the matter to an industrial court, pre-empting any decision to take strike action.
In cases where workers have become frustrated with the lengthy process and have decided to go ahead with a strike, their action has usually been declared illegal.
Legal action against striking prison warders: The authorities decided to take nine prison warders to court as suspected ringleaders of a strike in April that affected almost all the country's prisons.
It should be noted that prison warders are not allowed to form unions or to go on strike.
This illegal strike did, however, lead the authorities to make a few improvements to the disgraceful working conditions of these workers.
Workers allowed to join unions in EPZs, but with restrictions: Workers in the export processing zones (EPZs) are allowed to join trade unions, but they still suffer appalling working conditions, and those who complain are threatened with the sack.
Labour law does apply in the EPZs; however, there are many exemptions.
According to the Tailors and Textile Workers Union (TTWU), most firms based in EPZs have refused to recognise trade unions and obstructed their efforts to organise workers.
The country has 39 EPZs, but the number of people working in them, the majority of whom are women, has dropped sharply in recent years, from 50,000 in 2003 to 35,000 in 2008.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Kuwait
A new and somewhat disappointing new labour code was finally passed in the last days of 2009.
Public sector workers are not allowed to go on strike and the single trade union system continues to exist.
One prominent union leader and parliamentarian was detained for 12 days while the government was also accused of interfering in the activities and governance of the Kuwait journalists union.
The abuse of migrant workers again made headlines throughout the year.
Despite recent improvements to trade union rights, a number of problematic areas exist in the law.
A new Labour Code was adopted in December 2009, and while some excessive restrictions were dropped, several others remain.
Only one national federation is permitted, the Kuwait Trade Union Federation (KTUF), which only organises workers in the oil and petrochemical sector, together with public sector workers including employees of some ministries.
While the Labour Code no longer requires at least 100 workers to establish a union nor limits the number of unions per establishment, it still stipulates that the right to form unions lies with Kuwaiti workers.
The rule that the assets of a dissolved union are turned over to the authorities was also removed from the new Code.
However, the authorities have wide powers to supervise trade union finances and records, and unions may not engage in any political activity.
Furthermore, the Labour Code provides that no collective agreement may exceed three years, thus unduly restricting the right to free collective bargaining.
In the event of a collective dispute, compulsory arbitration can be imposed on the parties if they don't reach an agreement.
Finally, there is no protection for strikers against retribution.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Background: The 2008 general election returned more rigid salafi Islamists and tribal candidates, over the reformist Islamic Constitutional Movement (HADAS).
In March, however, Parliament was dissolved after allegations of corruption and in the subsequent May 2009 elections, three female MPs win seats.
In December, another corruption scandal erupts but the government survives.
The main labour unrest consisted of strikes and protests by migrant workers who were again subjected to physical, emotional and sexual abuse.
There has been a recent spate of Islamist militant violence.
After lengthy discussions on 25 December 2009, a new labour law passed which contains many improvements, however, the sponsorship system which contributes to much of the abusive working conditions for migrants has been kept.
Serious restrictions on organising: The single trade union system continues to exist.
However, despite the trade union monopoly imposed by law, some trade unions exist outside the Kuwait Trade Union Federation (KTUF), such as the Bank Workers' Union and the Kuwait Airways Workers' Union.
In practice, reports indicate that foreign workers have joined trade unions before they have worked in the country for the statutory five years.
However, less than 5% of the unionised workforce is foreign.
Migrant workers remain vulnerable to abuse and retribution if they protest poor working conditions.
Strikes occur despite restrictions: Strikes are rare, not least because they are only allowed in the private sector, which is not organised, is very small and is mostly composed of foreigners whose stay in the country could be compromised.
However, despite the ban strikes do occur.
For example, workers at the Shuwaikh, Shuaiba and Doha ports went on strike in March 2009 over low pay and other working conditions.
The strike occurred after years of failed negotiations.
Victimisation of unionists: In April, the Kuwait Trade Union Federation (KTUF) and its President Khaled Al-Azemi condemned the forced transfer of Ahmed Al-Anzi, the President of the trade union of the Civil Employees at the Ministry of Defense.
The KTUF claimed that he had been under investigation as a result of his trade union activities.
Migrant workers exploited: The government's policy of reducing its reliance on migrant workers has not been implemented.
These workers are still exploited, even though the government has sought to improve their legal protection.
During November alone, there were 13 cases of alleged suicide or suicide attempts in Kuwait by domestic workers.
In June, a delegation from Indonesia's trade unions in Indonesia condemned the Indonesian Embassy in Kuwait for not taking action against employers who had reportedly raped and tortured some 350 Indonesian female migrant workers.
In October, the Indonesian Labour Ministry suspended deployment of Indonesian domestic workers to Kuwait until the cases of 600 abused domestic workers were resolved.
Then in November 2009, it announced it was to repatriate some 1,750 Indonesian workers in the region including those in Kuwait.
Kuwait was earlier criticised for rejecting a proposal of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) to establish a centre to provide assistance to human trafficking victims.
However, the Kuwait Trade Union Federation (KTUF) is undertaking new programmes addressing the issue.
2009 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Kuwait
The draft labour code has still not passed into law.
Public sector workers are not allowed to go on strike.
The single trade union system continues to exist.
Hundreds of migrant workers were arrested and deported after strikes protesting about terrible conditions and low pay.
Progress on new Labour Code?
: Since 1996 the government has promised to introduce a new Labour Code in line with international labour standards but has still failed to do so.
It has set up a tripartite committee to review the draft code and has sought the ILO's technical assistance to ensure it complies with international standards.
Freedom of association – right to organise: Single trade union system: The law provides for a single trade union system, with only one national federation, the Kuwait Trade Union Federation (KTUF), allowed.
This restriction remains in the new draft labour code.
At present there may not be more than one trade union per establishment, enterprise or activity, but this will change if the new code is adopted.
The KTUF only organises public sector workers, including workers in some ministries, but is pressing the government to be allowed to organise in the private sector.
Barriers to organising: At least 100 workers are required in order to organise a trade union.
The founding members must include at least 15 workers of Kuwaiti nationality.
In effect, this restricts the workers from organising in the private sector, as the majority of workers are migrants.
For a trade union to be officially recognised, the Ministry of Interior must deliver a statement certifying its approval of the list of founding members.
All these provisions have been dropped in the new draft code.
Government supervision: Government authorities have wide powers of supervision over trade union finances and records, and the government subsidises up to 90% of most union budgets.
If a union is dissolved, its assets are turned over to the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, although this provision will be eliminated if the new code becomes law.
Trade unions may not engage in political activity, and the courts can dissolve any union that violates the labour laws or threatens public order and morality.
The restriction on political activity remains in the new code.
Workers excluded from labour law: Domestic workers and maritime workers are not permitted to either found or belong to a trade union.
The new draft does not change this.
Right to collective bargaining: Collective bargaining is recognised in law, and in 2007 the government ratified ILO Convention 98 on the right to collective bargaining.
According to the Civil Service Law, the government and its employees establish wages and conditions in consultation with the Government Workers' Union.
Employers and workers in the private sector negotiate directly, subject to certain restrictions.
Right to strike: Strike action is only allowed in the private sector, which accounts for 6% of the workforce.
Compulsory arbitration is imposed if the workers and employers are unable to resolve a conflict.
The new draft code still contains this provision, even though by international labour standards compulsory arbitration should apply to essential services only.
There is no protection for strikers against retribution by the state.
Migrant workers: Foreign workers, who make up about 80% of the workforce, must have lived in Kuwait for at least five years and must obtain a certificate of moral standing and good conduct before they are allowed to join trade unions as nonvoting members.
They are not permitted to run for any trade union posts.
The restrictions on the role of foreign workers in trade unions have been removed in the new draft.
As a result, many are grossly exploited.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2008
Organising: Despite the trade union monopoly imposed by law, some trade unions exist outside the KTUF, such as the Bank Workers' Union and the Kuwait Airways Workers' Union.
In practice, reports indicate that foreign workers have joined trade unions before they have worked in the country for the statutory five years.
However, less than 5% of the unionised workforce is foreign.
Two hundred Bangladeshi workers deported: Hundreds of Bangladeshis employed as cleaners and rubbish collectors by Al-Jawhara Company in Jleeb Al-Shyoukh were arrested by police on 29 July in Kuwait City after a week of violent strikes and protests.
Up to 7,000 Bangladeshi workers had been protesting over working conditions.
Employers are said to withhold salaries for up to nine months, and to house them in overcrowded, squalid conditions.
2009 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Kyrgyzstan
The current Labour Code is designed to attract foreign investors more than to protect workers' rights, although basic trade union rights are recognised.
The President of the Federation of Trade Unions of Kyrgyzstan was suspended from his work and later replaced by a government protégé.
Freedom of association: All workers have the right to form and belong to trade unions, and the law protects union members from anti-union discrimination.
Right to strike: Strikes can rarely be used as an instrument to defend workers' rights.
Under section 78(3) of the Labour Code, strikes are prohibited in the railway transport, public transport, civil aviation, communication services and enterprises that work round the clock, the stoppage of which would have hazardous consequences.
The ILO's Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR) has noted that as these services are not considered essential services according to the internationally recognised definition of the term, the government should amend its legislation so as to ensure that workers in the above services may exercise the right to strike.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2008
Government interference: On 1 February, Sagyn Bozgumbayev, the President of the Federation of Trade Unions of Kyrgyzstan (FPKg), which was an associated organisation of the ITUC at the time, was suspended from his office by the Pervomayski district court.
The charges against the trade unionist pertained to a criminal case that was officially closed in 2006, but on 31 January 2008 the Prosecutor-General's office decided to re-open the investigation.
Bozgumbayev was subsequently convicted and prohibited from holding an elected trade union post.
The ITUC saw Bozgumbayev's suspension as a move to get a democratically elected trade union leader replaced by the government's protégé.
Earlier, some officials of ministries and regional governments as well as public prosecutors approached the leaders of FPKg affiliates, suggesting that they vote a certain way during the trade union elections, however the trade unionists voted against the "intruder" twice.
In October, the FPKg executive committee, attended by the Deputy Prime-Minister and the Deputy Chairman of the national parliament, had to elect the new FPKg President by an open ballot, which resulted in the election of a government protégé.
With its leadership under the control of the state, the FPKg lost its ITUC associated organisation status in December, just over one year after obtaining it.
Employers: Some employers impede the work of trade unions by refusing to let unionists enter the enterprise where their members are employed.
In enterprises facing severe economic difficulties, management often threatens bankruptcy as a means of deterring trade union activity.
Collective agreements are not always respected.
Labour inspection is largely ineffective, and possible fines for trade union rights violations are merely token sums that do not promote compliance.
Unions taxed and fined: In some districts, taxes have been imposed on trade unions, although they are non-profit organisations and should therefore not be considered as taxpayers.
Within the broad principle of protecting freedom of enterprise, as protected by the Italian Constitution, a body of protective legislation and legally enforceable collective agreements has evolved which gives considerable protection against dismissal to employees.
Contracts of employment for manual and white-collar workers are regulated mainly by the Italian Civil Code (CC) as amended by several pieces of legislation relevant to employment affairs.
The most important on dismissal are: Act 604 (15 July 1966) on Individual Dismissals as amended by Act 108 (11 September 1990) and Act 300 (20 May 1970) on Workers’ Protection (often referred to as the Workers’ Statute) as amended by Act 108.
For collective dismissals, Act 223 (23 July 1991) is also an important statute.
For managerial employees the most important provisions are laid down in their national collective agreements.
Collective agreements are of considerable importance in Italy and almost all employees except for those employed in very small businesses are covered by collective agreements.
Industry-wide agreements concluded between the main trade union confederations and the relevant employers’ associations for a particular sector are binding on all employers and all manual and white-collar employees in that sector irrespective of whether they have been directly or indirectly involved in the drawing up and ratification of that agreement.
The onus is on the employer to comply with the terms and conditions of the agreement and with any procedures and provisions relating to termination of the contract of employment which may improve upon basic statutory minima.
Even inter-union agreements drawn up in the form of recommendations or codes of practice without the ratification of the employers may have relevance in practice and in law.
For example, the inter-union agreement of 5 May 1966 on collective dismissal, until recent changes in the law, was seen by the courts as a standard of practice for employers.
The CC and Acts 300/1970 and 604/66 cover manual and white-collar workers.
Labour law is concerned only with the private sector, and is traditionally clearly distinguished from the law on public employment.
Fixed-term contracts are considered an exception to indefinite employment and the contract of employment is considered indefinite except in cases specified by legislation (Act 230 of 1962).
The permitted cases of fixed-term work include seasonal work, replacement of ill employees or employees on maternity leave, and extraordinary or occasional work.
In addition, following recent legislation, collective agreements may provide for further permitted cases (Act 56 of 1987).
However, legislation still provides for maximum durations of fixed-term contracts, and limits the situations in which they can be used.
Until recently, a breach of legislative requirements on fixed-term contracts led to employers typically being required to employ the employee indefinitely.
Recently, however, Act 196 of 1997 has limited this sanction to ongoing violations.
If employment continues for ten days beyond the expiry date, the employer is liable to pay 20 per cent extra remuneration; for 20 days beyond the expiry date, 40 per cent extra; and only then is the contract required to be converted into an indefinite one.
A fixed-term contract will also be deemed to be indefinite if the employee is rehired after less than either ten or 20 days from its expiry (ten days for contracts of less than six months’ duration; 20 days for contracts of six months’ duration or more).
Act 196 of 1997 also deals with the restriction on temporary work and regulates temporary work agencies.
The use of temporary work is permitted, but only in limited instances, such as the replacement of absent workers and where permitted by collective agreements.
The Act also identifies a number of cases in which temporary work is prohibited, including in dangerous work, to replace strikers, and in firms shedding labour where the employees hold the same qualifications at those to be recruited on a temporary basis.
The different ways in which a labour contract can come to an end are enumerated and regulated in part by the general law of contract and in part by specific provisions of labour law.
The application of the general principles of the civil law to the labour contract has been progressively reduced as a consequence of the emergence of more detailed special provisions.
The basic trend of these provisions is to promote the stability of employment in favour of the employee, restricting in various ways the possible grounds for dismissal.
If withdrawal from the contract is due to the employee’s resignation, then there are no legal restrictions, although most collective agreements stipulate periods of notice and that notice must be given in writing.
However, any employee may resign with immediate effect in the circumstances specified in sec.
2110 of the CC (such as non-payment of wages or social security contributions, closure of the enterprise, failure to be included within the category or grade corresponding to the work effectively being undertaken, refusal to grant holidays, the unilateral changing of the employee’s duties with a corresponding reduction in wages, offences by the employer against the duty to safeguard the physical and psychological well-being of the employee under sec.
2087 of the CC).
Termination of a contract of indefinite duration by the employer (sec.
1, Act 604), on the other hand, is only possible for a “justified reason” and provided that the notice period is respected (sec.
2118, CC); or without notice for a just cause (sec.
2119, CC).
Collective agreements frequently list the grounds for dismissal.
Termination without grounds is limited to trial periods, domestic workers, employees who have reached retirement age and directors.
For all dismissals an employer must make a severance payment (trattamento di fine rapporto).
There are a number of provisions protecting individual categories of employees, which will render their dismissal automatically unfair; for example, dismissal on the grounds of political opinion, trade union membership, sex, race, language or religious affiliation will automatically be unfair, and members of workers’ committees may not be dismissed or transferred for one year following the cessation of their duties on the committee without the authorization of the relevant regional trade union organization.
Discriminatory dismissals (sec.
3, Act 108) are considered null and void.
Reinstatement of these workers is mandated by law.
This law also applies to directors and domestic workers.
Dismissal on the grounds of pregnancy, if the dismissal takes place between the conception and the end of the female employee’s statutory period of absence on confinement leave or unpaid leave, until the child reaches one year of age, is specifically prohibited.
Dismissal on the grounds of marriage is also prohibited.
Protection against unfair dismissal of managerial employees is regulated by collective agreements.
Act 223/1991 on collective dismissals applies to all employees except managers in firms employing more than 15 people (five employees in the agricultural sector).
All dismissals in firms of fewer than 15 employees are regulated by the law on individual dismissals even if they take place together.
A collective dismissal is defined as a change in employment levels caused by a reduction in, or change of, activity involving five or more employees in a single unit of production over a period of 120 days or five employees in several units belonging to a single employer within a province.
The law also covers job losses in firms which cease doing business entirely.
There are no specific procedures for termination on the grounds of just cause, and notice is not required.
Dismissal for justified motive, however, must be in writing.
The employer must wait for five days, during which the employee has the right to be heard, before dismissal.
The employee is entitled to ask the reason for dismissal within 15 days and the employer must reply within seven days.
In cases of disciplinary dismissal, the conciliation procedures laid down in sec.
7 of the Workers’ Statute must be followed.
The section states that an employee can request, via his or her trade union, that his or her case be heard by a conciliation and arbitration tribunal.
Failure to observe the correct procedures renders the termination null and void.
According to sec.
2118 of the CC, either party may terminate a contract of unspecified duration by giving the required notice as specified by existing regulations or customs and practice or according to the principles of equity (see however the reference to the need for a “justified reason” above).
Either party failing to give the required notice becomes liable for a payment equal to the remuneration which would have been paid during the period of notice.
The employer must also make such a payment in lieu of notice in cases where the employee dies in service.
The length of periods of notice is governed largely by collective agreements at the national industry level and varies according to the sector, category of employee and length of service.
The use of the indemnity has been made flexible to some extent.
Act 233 provides that a maximum of 70 per cent of the indemnity acquired can be requested in advance given certain conditions (e.g.
minimum eight years of seniority, no prior requests) for certain expenditures and purchase of initial residence.
Since 1977, a scheme of severance pay has existed by law.
It is partially protected against inflation.
Employees are entitled to a severance payment for any termination of contract based on the formula of a year’s salary divided by 13.5, plus 1.5 per cent for each year’s service plus compensation for inflation.
It is payable whenever an Italian employee leaves his or her job for whatever reason, and is based on length of service with the company.
Instead of assessing it on the basis of the last wage multiplied by the years of service, Act 233 provides that every year a certain amount of wages is set aside to be paid upon termination.
At the termination of employment, whatever the method used to effect it, the worker is entitled to receive from the employer, in addition to any other sum of money, a special allowance called seniority indemnity.
This indemnity is peculiar to Italian law and has undergone long evolution.
Where there are fewer than 15 employees in each unit or fewer than 60 employees in total, the case cannot come before a magistrate unless conciliation has been requested beforehand according to the procedures laid down in collective agreements or in secs.
410 and 411 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
Under the Workers’ Statute any employer who refuses to comply with a magistrate’s reinstatement order must continue to pay the employee his or her full remuneration until the employer complies.
If the unfair dismissal is in connection with the employee’s trade union duties, the employer is liable to pay an additional day’s pay for every day of non-compliance.
The employer may immediately lodge an appeal against the decision to reinstate.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Lesotho
While serious problems remain in terms of anti-union discrimination, there has been some progress in developing collective bargaining in the country's crucial textile industry.
Normal trade union activities are difficult to carry out despite some legal guarantees.
Although the law allows unions to conduct their activities without interference, high thresholds and restrictive provisions make such work difficult.
Workers have the right to form and join trade unions, expect for public employees, who can only form or join "associations" that have consultative status.
Moreover, union activities are hampered by requirements that only registered unions that represent more than 35% of the employees are entitled to elect workplace union representatives and have access to the workplace to communicate with management and perform other union functions.
Finally, a strike can only be called following very complicated procedures, and all strikes in the public sector are illegal by definition.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Legislation not enforced: The country has a poor record on respecting trade union rights.
In the private sector, the complex procedures and employers' anti-union attitude make it very difficult to operate a trade union.
Although the law prohibits anti-union discrimination, many employers stop union organisers from entering factory premises to organise workers or represent them in disputes.
In some cases, employers intimidate union organisers and members, threatening the latter with dismissal, particularly in domestic industries.
2008 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Lesotho
Workers in the private sector have the right to form and join trade unions without prior authorisation.
All trade unions must be registered with the Registrar of Trade Unions.
Public servants denied union rights: Currently, public employees, including university lecturers, are prohibited from forming and joining trade unions, in spite of the fact that the Lesotho Constitution guarantees freedom of association.
They can only form or join "associations" that have consultative status.
The government has promised that the new Public Service Bill will guarantee freedom of association to public officers and allow them to form associations for collective bargaining.
The right to strike is recognised, but complicated procedures must be followed before strike action is authorised.
Civil servants are not allowed to strike and all public sector industrial action is illegal by definition.
In law, all legally recognised trade unions enjoy the right to organise and to collective bargaining.
Trade union rights in practice and Violations in 2007
Legislation not enforced: The government and some employers, particularly in the textile sector, do not observe trade union freedoms.
In the private sector, the complex procedures and employers' anti-union attitude make it very difficult to operate a trade union.
Foreign employers in the export processing zones (EPZs), mainly textile groups from South Africa, Hong Kong and Taiwan, ignore national legislation and pay wages below the statutory minimum.
They are usually very anti-union, and collaborate with government to declare strikes "illegal".
However, according to a report published in 2007 by the Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations, the pressure exerted on the big brands with suppliers in Lesotho by NGOs and trade union organisations like the Lesotho Clothing and Allied Workers Union (LECAWU) and the International Textile, Garment & Leather Workers' Federation (ITGLWF) were having a real impact.
"Trade unions' access to the factories has improved, though the percentage of organised workers remains rather low and some companies still prevent all contacts".
Labour Court cannot review civil servants rights' cases: The government has removed cases concerning civil servants' rights from the Labour Court, thus effectively taking away their rights to present their cases.
This has prevented the affiliates of COLETU, the Lesotho Union of Public Employees (LUPE) and the Lesotho Teachers' Trade Union from assisting their members.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Lebanon
The authorities have broad powers to control trade unions.
Many migrants, particularly domestic servants, and Palestinian workers lack trade union rights and are poorly treated.
Despite the right to strike being restricted, workers went on strike at Kadisha Electricity Company and the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA).
Trade union rights are not adequately secured, although a new draft amendment to the Labour Code would improve the situation somewhat.
The law recognises the right of workers, except government employees, to set up and belong to trade unions.
However, prior authorisation is needed from the Ministry of Labour in order to form a trade union.
The Ministry also controls all trade union elections, including the date of the election, the procedure and the ratification of the results.
Furthermore, unions are prohibited from engaging in any political activity, and the law permits the administrative dissolution of trade unions.
The thresholds for engaging in collective bargaining are high, and all collective agreements must be ratified by two-thirds of the union members at a general assembly.
Although the right to strike is recognised, it is limited by the obligation to announce the number of participants in advance, as well as by the requirement that 5% of the union's members be given responsibility for maintaining order during the strike.
The organisers of a strike must also sign a document whereby they assume full responsibility for all damages that occur during a demonstration.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Background: Political tensions in the country make it difficult to carry on trade union activity independently of political manipulation.
In November, a new coalition government was finally formed ending five months of deadlock since the elections in June.
The deadlock over the new government had threatened Lebanon's stability.
Security forces continue to detain opponents and suspects without charge or trial.
Government interference: The government has often interfered in trade union affairs, instigating or aggravating conflicts within the trade union movement.
Senior politicians have managed to have their nominees placed on the governing body of the Lebanese General Workers Union (CGTL), causing friction within the union when it opposes government policy.
Migrant workers abused and excluded: An estimated 200,000 domestic workers, primarily from Sri Lanka, Ethiopia and the Philippines, remain essentially outside of crucial labour laws and subject to exploitation and frequent abuse by employers and agencies including non-payment of wages, forced confinement to the workplace, no time off, and verbal or physical abuse.
The sponsorship system ties the worker's residency to a specific employer, making it very hard for a domestic worker to change employers, even in cases of abuse.
Once employment is terminated the worker loses residency, making it difficult to file complaints because workers' fear detention owing to their illegal status.
According to UN sources, 80 Ethiopian women have been in Tripoli Women's Prison for over a year, accused of not having a passport, which was either taken from them when they started as domestic workers, or which they never had in the first place.
Most were arrested after running away from their employers – usually because of abuses.
Palestinians denied many rights: There are approximately 400,000 Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, which accounts for 11% of the Lebanese population.
Palestinians are not allowed to form trade unions, as there has to be a reciprocal arrangement with their home state.
They are also excluded from many professions reserved for Lebanese nationals, although there have been recent improvements, with more professions opening up to Palestinians.

"Ensuring occupational safety and health demands the participation of all levels and divisions of a company.

2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Liberia
There was blatant interference in a union ballot by one multinational company, while another failed to implement key aspects of a collective agreement.
Three workers on a rubber plantation were shot and seriously injured during a strike.
The legal framework for trade union activities remains lacking until the labour law is reformed.
Many shortcomings in the labour law exist, although promises of a reform were made by the Labour Minister in 2006.
The Constitution guarantees freedom of association, but employees of state-run enterprises and the civil services cannot form trade unions.
In addition, the laws on anti-union discrimination are deficient, and do neither award sufficient protection against discrimination during recruitment or at work, nor do they protect unions against employer interference.
Finally, the government's Labour Practices Review Board has the right to supervise trade union elections, and workers in state enterprises do not have collective bargaining rights.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Weak protection of trade union rights in multinational companies: Broadly speaking the government does respect freedom of association, although its record on including the Labour Congress in tripartite forums has been patchy, and it has not managed to prevent big multinational companies from flouting union rights.
Labour and human rights activists have expressed particular concern about the seeming impunity of the Firestone Tyre and Rubber Company when it comes to workers' rights violations.
Employer flouts collective agreement: Bridgestone Firestone, which operates the world's second largest rubber plantation, in Harbel, has failed to respect several of the key commitments in a contract signed with its workers' union, the Firestone Agricultural Workers' Union of Liberia (FAWUL).
Workers on the plantation have long faced incredibly poor living and working conditions.
Firestone rubber tappers live in crowded shacks without running water, electricity or indoor latrines and are required to meet an unreasonably high production quota in order to receive their meagre pay.
After a long struggle, workers finally held their first free and fair union election and signed their first contract negotiated by a democratically elected and independent union leadership in August 2008 (see 2009 issue of the Survey).
Strikers shot: Three strikers were seriously injured on Friday 20 March when the senior senator Laha Lassana of the region opened fire on the employees at the Guthrie rubber plantation in Western Bomi County.
Some 3,000 employees of one of Liberia's biggest state-owned rubber plantations had been on strike for several weeks because of delays in salary payments.
The senator had appealed to them to go back to work a few weeks earlier and promised their salaries would be paid.
But when the workers ended their strike, the senator did not keep his promise.
When Lassana returned to the plantation on Friday, things turned violent.
The workers held him hostage.
When the police arrived, the senator tried to escape and shot the three strikers.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Madagascar
As the country became mired in a major political crisis, trade union rights were even less of a priority for its rulers.
Much of the labour law and trade union rights are determined by decree, and is not favourable to trade unions.
Although the Labour Code provides for basic trade union rights, it also contains excessive restrictions.
It is complemented by decrees.
Both private and public sector workers have the right to join and form unions, except for seafarers and workers in essential services, the list of which exceeds the ILO definition.
The establishment, organisation and operation of trade unions is determined by decree, and unions must provide lists of all their members, which exposes them to the possibility of anti-union abuse.
Industrial disputes must go through conciliation, mediation, and arbitration procedures determined by the authorities.
Furthermore, state employees are not allowed to strike due to Article 33 of the 2007 Constitution, which stipulates that "the right to strike is recognised without prejudice to the principle of continuity of public services or to the security and essential needs of the Nation", a provision that does not explicitly exclude private sector employees either.
The authorities also have broad powers to requisition public employees in essential services.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Export Processing Zones: No serious violations were reported.
According to the trade unions, the recent complaint lodged with the ILO further to a new law allowing for excessive overtime and night work by women raised awareness, and employers have become more respectful of the trade unions.
In recent years, most cases of discrimination against union members concerned employers in zones where union presence was low.
It is estimated that the zones have generated 100,000 direct jobs and 400,000 indirect jobs.
Trade union rights often ignored: The predominance of subsistence agriculture and the informal sector as well as the authorities' relative indifference to and the employers' contempt for trade union activities all help ensure that labour legislation only applies to a small minority of workers.
Over recent years the trade unions have complained of the opacity of the agreements concluded between the authorities and the mining companies.
According to a report published in October 2009 by the Workers' Conference of Madagascar (CTM) and the Friedrich-Ebert Stiftung (FES), most collective agreements have been signed in public enterprises.
With privatisation, however, many have become obsolete (rail, telecommunications, energy, etc.
).
2009 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Madagascar
Restrictions on the right to strike and new legislation on export processing zones.
Within the space of just two months, the labour legislation saw the introduction of two new instruments that can only lead to a deterioration in trade union rights.
Freedom of association: The Constitution of April 2007 guarantees both public and private sector workers, with the exception of seafarers and workers providing so-called essential services, the right to join and form trade unions.
However, according to the current Labour Code, the establishment, organisation and operation of trade unions is determined by decree.
Radio and television broadcasting and banking are included in the so-called essential services classification, largely exceeding the limits set in the ILO definition.
The Labour Code does not cover seafarers.
Under the Maritime Code, they do have the right to conclude collective agreements, but their right to organise is not specifically recognised in law.
New restriction on the right to strike enshrined in the Constitution: Article 33 of the Constitution adopted in April 2007 stipulates that "the right to strike is recognised without prejudice to the principle of continuity of public services or to the security and essential needs of the Nation".
This provision is much too broad, as it covers all state employees and does not explicitly exclude private sector employees.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2008
Trade union rights widely violated: The prevalence of subsistence farming and work in the informal economy, coupled with the relative indifference of the government and the contempt of employers for trade union activities mean that the labour legislation only applies to a small minority of the workers.
Those that are covered by the labour legislation are still very vulnerable to anti-union discrimination.
Trade unions ignored in mining projects: Over recent years, trade unions have repeatedly criticised the lack of transparency in the agreements reached between the government and the mining corporations.
The unions have never been consulted about these projects.
Numerous violations in the EPZs: In practice, trade union rights are flouted every day in EPZs due to a lack of political will and resources.
Workers have great problems forming trade unions or engaging in collective bargaining.
In factories where a union has managed to obtain recognition it is very difficult to hold union meetings, or they are categorically banned, and the unions complain about a lack of goodwill from employers who prevent any real dialogue between the social partners.
Just one EPZ company out of the 62 in total is applying a collective agreement.
The unions reported the persistence of abuses such as compulsory overtime, forced night work for women and sexual harassment.
Government interference in trade union affairs: A government decree, issued in 2000, requires trade unions to provide a list of their members, a copy of their statutes and the names of their serving officers.
The government claimed this was merely to ensure that trade unions were representative.
As the ILO pointed out, a record of membership dues should be sufficient for this purpose, as a list of names could make members more vulnerable to anti-union discrimination.
The country's trade unions also claim that the Ministry of Public Service, Labour and Social Law interferes in the election of worker representatives to various tripartite bodies.
It organises missions involving workers' representatives without the knowledge of their confederations – with a view to appointing them to regional tripartite bodies – and calls for candidates other than those already put forward by the confederations to serve on these bodies.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Malawi
There is some legal protection for trade union activities, although some gaps remain in the labour law.
Workers, including civil servants, have the right to form and join trade unions, and workers sacked because of their union activities must be reinstated.
However, unions seeking to bargain collectively face inordinately high representation thresholds.
In addition, industrial councils set wages and conditions and resolve disputes in the absence of collective agreements.
Only registered unions may strike, and the procedures prior to a strike can be long.
Furthermore, all labour disputes must be reported to the Principal Secretary responsible for labour, who shall acknowledge the dispute within seven days and then refer it to conciliation, which can last up to 21 days.
Furthermore, the law does not specifically prohibit retaliation against strikers.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Employer resistance: Since barely 12% of workers are in formal employment, the labour legislation automatically excludes the vast majority of workers in the informal economy.
For the small minority in formal jobs, the resistance of some employers, and the government, towards respecting their rights, limits freedom of association and collective bargaining.
Speaking to the press in June 2009 Ronald Mbewe, general secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU), said most employers were reluctant to work with trade unions.
His views were echoed by Mary Dzinyemba, general secretary for Commercial Industrial and Allied Workers Union (CIAWU), who said employers preferred to have workers who were ignorant of their rights.
Many companies in the EPZs also resist union activity, while the unions complain that they have little access to workers in the zones.
No collective bargaining for informal sector workers: The workers in the informal economy have organised themselves into a union, the Malawi Union for the Informal Sector (MUFIS), and have since been affiliated to the Malawi Congress of Trade Unions (MCTU), but it took them over two years to get registered with the Ministry of Labour, as they point out that the union had no negotiating partner.
The MCTU has reported in recent years on a number of cases where workers have been badly mistreated, and where employers have appeared unaware that workers have employment rights by law.
Right to strike opposed: Legal ambiguities in the application of the right to strike are making it very hard to exercise this right.
For instance, the law does not specify exactly which services are essential, enabling the authorities to declare strikes illegal.
The length of the procedure is also problematic.
2009 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Malawi
The large informal economy and gaps in the labour law make it very hard to carry out trade union activities.
In the tobacco industry, almost 300 workers were sacked for carrying out an "illegal" strike.
Freedom of association – rights recognised in theory: Workers have the right to form and join trade unions.
This includes civil servants, with the exception of army personnel and the police.
Unions must register with the Ministry of Labour, although this is largely a formality.
Collective bargaining: Collective bargaining is recognised in law, provided the union represents at least 20 per cent of employees at enterprise level.
At sectoral level, unions must represent at least 15 per cent of employees.
In the absence of collective agreements, the law provides for industrial councils to set wages and conditions and resolve disputes.
Cumbersome strike procedures: Registered unions may strike.
However, strike action can only be taken after all dispute settlement and conciliation procedures have been exhausted.
The employer and the Ministry of Labour must be given at least seven days' notice after the lapse of the 21 days' notice and further to the declaration by Ministry of Labour conciliators that the dispute is unresolved.
Workers in essential services have a limited right to strike.
The law does not specifically prohibit retaliation against strikers.
Labour laws apply in the export processing zones (EPZs).
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2008
Employer resistance: Since barely 10 per cent of workers are in formal employment, the labour legislation automatically excludes the vast majority of workers in the informal economy.
For the small minority in formal jobs, the resistance of some employers, and the government, towards respecting their rights, limits freedom of association and collective bargaining.
This was the case in a local branch of Group 4 Securicor (G4S), which was cited in the previous Survey for its anti-union hostility.
After the breakdown of negotiations in January and a threatened strike, the manager finally agreed to a 17% wage rise.
The workers in the informal economy have organised themselves into a union and have since been affiliated to the Malawi Congress of Trade Unions (MCTU), but it took them over two years to get registered with the Ministry of Labour, as they claim the union had no negotiating partner.
The MCTU has reported in recent years on a number of cases where workers are badly mistreated, and where employers appear unaware that workers have employment rights by law.
Right to strike opposed: Legal ambiguities in the application of the right to strike are making it very hard to exercise.
For instance, the law does not specify exactly which services are essential, enabling the authorities to declare strikes illegal.
The length of the procedure is also problematic.
In August, for example, 297 workers belonging to the Tobacco Tenants and Allied Workers Union of Malawi (TOTAWUM) were sacked by the Limbe Leaf Tobacco company (which sells a lot of its production to the Philip Morris group) for allegedly failing to respect the normal procedure, thus rendering the strike illegal.
The union then tried to meet the management.
The workers were demanding a wage increase, better working conditions and, above all, proper equipment to protect them against toxic substances.
When it comes to violation of fundamental trade union rights, transport workers can be particularly vulnerable.
Governments are willing to use a range of anti-union tactics to keep the movement of people and goods flowing.
The international labour standards are quite clear – transport workers have the same trade union rights as workers in other industrial sectors.
They have the right to freedom of association and are free to take industrial action.
Yet transport workers can be particularly vulnerable to restrictions on their trade union rights.
For example, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) has said that it is a serious violation of freedom of association to ban trade unions for international airline employees, public sector employees, and civilian staff in the armed forces.
Yet various governments have tried to ban unions in one or another of these categories so as to target the transport sector.
Some governments have tried to outlaw the right to strike specifically for transport unions.
Some have argued that the public service is an area where the right to strike should not be automatic.
Yet, according to the ILO, employees in state-owned commercial or industrial enterprises must be given the right to strike with only one proviso: “that the interruption of services does not endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population”.
The ILO has also said that the concept of public servant “should be limited to public servants exercising authority in the name of the state”.
The ILO does recognise that the right to strike can be restricted or even prohibited by governments in essential services.
However, this is only where stoppages would mean a serious threat to life, personal safety or health.
Hospital, utilities supply and telephone services can be designated as essential.
But in the transport sector, the ILO has identified only air traffic control, when this service is essential to guarantee air safety.
In all other areas of transport operation, the strict sense of the term “essential services” does not apply.
The ILO says that back-to-work orders, requisitioning orders, or the hiring of workers to break a strike in any of the sectors not strictly considered essential is a “serious violation of trade union rights”.
Governments have also used minimum services legislation to restrict transport workers’ rights.
The ILO says that minimum service levels can be laid down in the event of a strike but only where “life or normal living conditions” are endangered, and trade unions should participate in defining the level of minimum service.
Despite these ILO rulings, governments seem unable to resist classifying many forms of transport – road, rail, sea and air – as “essential services”.
They have also used requisitioning orders and excessive minimum services rules.
The 2001 Annual Survey of Violations of Trade Union Rights by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) gives many examples:
In Serbia, 12 trade union members were sacked after a strike in December 2000 at the Nis Express Transport Company.
In this country, the list of essential services is so long that some 60 per cent of employees are involved.
In Switzerland, a 1927 law included railway workers, as employees of a state enterprise, among those banned from striking.
A change to the law in January 2001 means they are no longer state employees and the ban is lifted, though there are still restrictions under their collective agreement.
Until recently German workers too were classified as “civil servants” and hence not permitted to strike but the law has now been revised.
In Quebec, Canada, the right to strike is limited by a very broad definition of essential services.
In November 2000, the Quebec authorities ordered truck drivers in Montreal back to work after they had gone on strike to demand that their employer recognise the union and engage in collective bargaining.
But the ITF has success stories to tell, too.
In Mexico, in 2001, trade union solidarity finally prevailed over government attempts to stop strikes by requisitioning.
Cabin crew at the private Mexican airline Aeroméxico were twice barred from striking after the government invoked the legal procedure of a requisitioning order, known as a requisa.
This provoked international protests, including a message from the ITF.
A third strike by the union Assa went ahead on 2 June 2001 but was called off within 48 hours, achieving an agreement for a 9.5 per cent pay rise.
“This is the first such case in Lithuania when the decision on strikes ended in such a result and we are very proud,” said Jonas Petraska, Chair of the Motor Transport Workers’ Federation, the union involved.
“The collective agreement is signed in the Vilnius bus depot and wages increased a little.
Negotiations are taking place in the Vilnius trolley-bus depot.”
An ILO ruling supported the union’s case and called on the Lithuanian government to amend its legislation so as not to restrict the right to strike.
The ruling also clarified the ILO’s own attitude to minimum service levels.
Where no agreement can be reached between workers, employers and governments on the minimum level to be set, an independent body must settle the matter.
Workers’ complaints to the ILO about such government violations of fundamental rights are heard by specialist bodies, the Committee on Freedom of Association and the Committee of Experts on Applications.
They are lengthy procedures but this is where definitive rulings of principle are made which can be used by trade unions to assert their rights.
“The International Labour Organisation (ILO) has ruled that apart from air traffic controllers, transport is not strictly an essential service.
Back-to-work orders in the transport sector are violations of trade union rights; the implementation of minimum services rules is also strictly defined,” Howard adds.
The 2001 Annual Survey of Violations of Trade Union Rights by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) published in October 2001 showed that, in the year 2000, 209 trade unionists were killed or “disappeared” – 50 per cent more than in the previous year and largely because of the appalling death toll in Colombia (see page 4).
Worldwide, about 8,500 were arrested, 3,000 injured, over 100,000 harassed, and nearly 20,000 dismissed because of their trade union activities.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Maldives
The Maldives have become a member of the ILO and the 2008 Constitution recognises fundamental trade union rights.
There are no real trade unions or collective bargaining however.
Employees in the powerful luxury hotel industry regularly face reprisals if they try to defend their rights.
All the leaders of a strike at the Bandos Island Resort lost their jobs.
Progress has been made to secure trade union rights and ensure conformity with international labour standards.
A new Constitution was ratified in August 2008, and includes a charter of fundamental rights and contains provisions on the separation of legislative and judicial powers.
The Constitution also guarantees, among other things, freedom of expression, freedom of association and the right to strike.
The Maldives joined the ILO on 15 May 2009, but has not yet ratified any conventions.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
No collective bargaining: According to a report by the Human Rights Commission of the Maldives, the actions of the Teachers Association of the Maldives (TAM), the Tourism Employees Association of the Maldives (TEAM) and a fishermen's association, among the most active in defending employees' rights in their respective sectors, are hampered by the uncertainties surrounding their status, mandate and in general the lack of laws defining their role, function and the procedures by which they may negotiate with employers.
In the absence of a real trade union, the concept of collective bargaining remains unknown in the Maldives.
Creation of a labour tribunal: A labour tribunal was established in mid-April with the mandate of enforcing the labour rights enshrined in the Employment Act.
Four days after its creation, 100 complaints had already been submitted, most of them concerning dismissals without warning and employment without contracts.
TAM (Teachers' Association of the Maldives) has complained that the tribunal's decisions are not applied when they are in the workers' favour.
Black lists and false charges: According to the Tourism Employees Association of the Maldives (TEAM), workers in the big luxury hotels who try to ensure the respect of their rights are the target of unfair dismissals and are black-listed.
They say that employers even have the support of some police departments in bringing false charges against the workers, such as the consumption of illegal drugs.
TEAM reports that when workers have to provide urine samples further to an investigation into drug consumption, in some cases positive results are announced orally, without any formal proof.
A positive test means dismissal and the end of the worker's career.
Furthermore say TEAM, the all-powerful luxury hotel industry and the government control the media, who paint a negative picture of trade unionism.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Malaysia
No improvements were made in the problems that have plagued the trade union movement for years.
The Malaysian government's failure to implement the new provisions under the Industrial Relations Act 1967 to resolve union recognition claims frustrated union representation for thousands of workers.
The authorities continue to have far-reaching powers to regulate trade unions, which operate in a restrictive legal environment.
The restrictions that apply to trade union rights are extensive.
While freedom of association is guaranteed in the Constitution, the Director General of Trade Unions (DGTU) within the Ministry of Human Resources has vast powers to refuse to register a union or withdraw union registration, and her/his decisions cannot be appealed in court.
In addition, a union must also obtain recognition from the employer, and may be suspended by the authorities for up to six months if deemed in the interest of national security or the public.
Trade union membership is limited to workers in similar trades, and the DGTU can determine the sector and category in which a union may organise.
Furthermore, the right to strike, although not specifically recognised, is very limited, and the procedures prior to a strike are cumbersome.
Unions may not strike over disputes relating to trade union registration or illegal dismissals, and both sympathy strikes and general strikes are forbidden.
Participation in an unlawful strike carries hefty penalties.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Ban on general confederations: Because of the ban on forming general confederations of trade unions, the Malaysian Trades Union Congress (MTUC), which covers both private and public sectors and has 500,000 members, is not recognised as a trade union confederation in law.
Instead, the MTUC is registered under the Societies Act and therefore does not have the right to conclude collective bargaining agreements nor to undertake industrial action.
Vague laws open up to abuse by employers: The law forbids managers and workers in executive positions from organising, but a definition of this category of workers is not provided in the law.
This has led to extensive abuse by most employers to deny union membership rights and remove experienced union leaders, often by interpreting the managerial and executive category as including supervisors, assistant supervisors, section leaders and lower-level supervisory personnel.
Another legal provision that is widely misused by the employers concerns the requirement that trade unions apply for recognition from the employers.
The latter use this to delay union recognition and thwart efforts by unions to organise and bargain collectively.
Union recognition is arbitrary and extremely slow: Obtaining a response from an employer to a request for union recognition should take a maximum of 21 days.
However, in reality this takes much longer if a dispute occurs, because the matter must be taken to the Director General of Industrial Relations, the Director General of Trade Unions (DGTU) and then the Minister of Human Resources, who has the final say, unless that is challenged in the High Court.
Some applications take as long as three to five years.
In a previous complaint to the ILO, the Malaysian Trades Union Congress (MTUC) listed cases in which the DGTU had arbitrarily denied organisational and collective bargaining rights to more than 8,000 workers in manufacturing companies.
Longstanding complaints from the MTUC and its affiliates over the cumbersome process to obtain union recognition and collective bargaining have also remained unresolved despite changes to the Industrial Relations Act.
The amendments stipulated specific measures to resolve the unions' claim for recognition within a period of six months.
Unfortunately, government authorities have claimed that they cannot enforce the amendments because of the absence of appropriate regulations.
Inefficient labour courts: So far, the government has failed to apply any sanctions against employers who have opposed its directives granting trade union recognition or who have refused to comply with industrial court orders to reinstate illegally dismissed workers.
In some cases, companies have used tactics such as changing their name to thwart workers' legal efforts.
Prohibition on migrant workers' organising: Approximately 2.6 million migrant workers in Malaysia (25% of total workforce) are prevented by law from organising.
The Malaysian Trades Union Congress claims that companies intimidate migrant workers to prevent them from joining the union and then use the fact that they are not members to deny recognition to unions by claiming they have the support of less than 50% of the workforce.
Notices placed on migrant work permits state that these workers are prohibited to join unions.
The system for registering migrant workers discourages workers from asserting their rights because it grants total discretion to employers to terminate workers for virtually any reason.
On 2 September, Malaysia's Home Ministry announced that Indonesian domestic workers working in Malaysia would be given one day off each week and allowed to keep their passports while working in Malaysia.
These terms were agreed upon by Malaysia and Indonesia at their third meeting of the Working Committee on the Recruitment and Placement of Indonesian Maids on 20 August.
As of November, Indonesia and Malaysia were still negotiating a revised bilateral agreement including a special Malaysian task force to deal with employer abuse and a higher minimum wage.
The Malaysian Trades Union Congress (MTUC) also reiterated its call to the government to allow foreign maids to form a union or at least an association to protect their interests.
MTUC Secretary-General, G. Rajasegaran, told a press conference that the 300,000 maids in Malaysia, unlike in neighbouring countries, were not protected by any legislation.
2009 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Malaysia
According to the Malaysian Trades Union Congress (MTUC), the Trade Unions Act (TUA), amended again in 2008, is designed to obstruct the creation and development of independent and strong unions.
Migrant workers are prevented by law from organising or applying to register a trade union and suffer from harsh working conditions.
Cases of union busting remain numerous.
Government weakens union rights in core labour laws: The law recognises the right of most workers to form and join trade unions, but the 1959 Trade Unions Act (TUA) and the 1967 Industrial Relations Act (IRA) place extensive restrictions on freedom of association.
The ILO Committee on Freedom of Association (CFA) has found that many provisions of the TUA violate the principles of freedom of association, and it noted in its 349th Report that recent amendments in the laws were done "without consideration" of the ILO's recommendations.
Many restrictions on union formation, wide discretion in de-registering unions: The Director General of Trade Unions (DGTU) has the power to supervise and inspect trade unions, can refuse to register a trade union without giving any reason for the refusal and can withdraw registration.
Unions that do not register, or whose registration has been denied or withdrawn, are considered illegal organisations.
The DGTU is given very broad discretion in deciding these matters.
The DGTU may also deregister a union if s/he finds that two or more registered trade unions exist in a "particular establishment, trade, occupation or industry".
The DGTU has the authority to suspend a branch of a trade union if s/he "is satisfied" that the branch has contravened any part of the Act or the rules of the union.
The DGTU can specify the sector and category in which a union would be permitted to organise.
The TUA limits trade union membership to workers in similar trades.
General unions are prohibited.
The government continues to bar the formation of national unions in the electronics industry and only allows the creation of in-house, enterprise-level electronics unions.
The Minister of Human Resources may also suspend a trade union for up to six months in the interests of national security or public.
Requirement of union to receive recognition from employer: The IRA provides that a trade union must apply for recognition from the employer, who then can recognise the union, deny recognition or appeal to the Director General for a ruling on whether the members of the union are members.
This provision is systematically abused by employers to delay union recognition and thwart efforts by unions to organise and collectively bargain.
The new IRA has further weakened union protections by abandoning the previous practice of requiring officials to use the register of trade union members (which is required by law) to determine the legitimacy of challenges to employers' refusal to recognise a union.
This provides for a secret ballot of workers to be undertaken, but the law completely fails to provide adequate safeguards against employer manipulation of the size of the bargaining unit (through addition of temporary or fixed-term contract workers) for the purposes of the election.
The new IRA law also contains provisions that are biased towards recognition of enterprise-level unions as opposed to industrial unions.
Another amendment to the IRA in 2007 provides that if the trade union fails to report to the Minister within 14 days about the employer's refusal to recognise the union, the Minister shall deem the union's application for recognition withdrawn.
Furthermore, the law now states that workers in a union that has its recognition withdrawn in this manner shall have no protection against dismissal.
Migrant workers: In early 2008, the government completed a process of amending the TUA 1959 and the IRA 1967 in a number of ways which were vehemently opposed by the Malaysian labour movement.
One of the provisions that has relevance to migrant workers is a change in the method for determining the legitimacy of a union's challenge to an employers' refusal to recognise the union.
The new IRA has further weakened union protections by abandoning the previous practice of requiring officials to use the register of trade union members (which is required by law) for determining the legitimacy of challenges to an employers' refusal to recognise a union.
Now the law requires a secret ballot of workers to be conducted, in which the union must achieve a majority to win.
However, the law fails to provide adequate safeguards against employer manipulation of the size of the bargaining unit (through addition of temporary or fixed-term contract workers, including those who are migrants) for the purposes of the election.
Employer intimidation then is used to either prevent migrant workers from voting or ensuring they vote against the union – in either case contributing to the same goal of defeating the union's effort to prove its representative status to challenge the employer's refusal to recognise the union.
Under the TUA and the IRA, a migrant worker can join an existing labour union and participate in its activities.
However, Article 28(a) of the TUA requires that any union officer must be a citizen of Malaysia, effectively disqualifying migrant workers from serving as leaders of a union.
The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) also sets out a series of conditions connected to the issuance of work permits to migrant workers.
One of these conditions is an absolute prohibition on migrant workers joining any sort of association.
Restrictions on the public sector: In the public sector, employees working for the defence sector, police force or prisons do not have the right to form or join trade unions.
Restrictions on the right to strike: The right to strike is not specifically recognised, and legislative restrictions make it practically impossible for workers to hold a legal strike.
Trade unions are not allowed to go on strike for disputes relating to trade union registration or illegal sackings.
General strikes and sympathy strikes are not permitted.
Penalties for executive committee members of a union who engage in an illegal strike include fines and imprisonment for up to one year.
Rank and file workers who engage in an illegal strike are considered by the government to be automatically stripped of their union membership and cannot join another trade union in the future without the written approval of the DGTU.
Pre-strike authorisation procedures are cumbersome.
Two thirds of the members of a trade union must vote in favour of a strike in a secret ballot, and the ballot must include a resolution that states "the nature of the acts to be carried out or to be avoided during the strike".
The results of the ballot are passed to the DGTU for verification.
Once all procedures have been complied with, a seven-day cooling-off period is imposed.
During the cooling-off period, the Ministry of Human Resources' Industrial Relations Department can attempt conciliation and, if this fails, refer the dispute to the Industrial Court.
While the dispute is before the Industrial Court, picketing, strikes and lockouts are prohibited.
Prior approval needed for international affiliation: The TUA requires that trade unions seek prior permission from the DGTU before affiliating with any "consultative body...established outside of Malaysia".
Consideration of that application is subject to whatever conditions the DGTU sees fit to impose.
In the public sector, the joint council system limits public sector unions to a consultative role where their only power is to "express their point of view" on principles regarding wages and working conditions.
Industrial Court's discretionary power removed: According to the MTUC, the new amendments removed the discretionary powers of the Industrial Court, which had hitherto played a prominent role in the settling of labour disputes and promoting industrial harmony.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2008
Ban on general confederations: Owing to the ban on forming general confederations of trade unions, the MTUC, which covers both private and public sectors and has 500,000 members, is not recognised as a trade union confederation in law.
Instead, the MTUC is registered under the Societies Act and therefore does not have the right to conclude collective bargaining agreements nor to undertake industrial action.
Canon Opto's refusal to recognise in-house trade union: Japanese multinational Canon Opto refused to recognise the in-house union despite certification by the Ministry of Human Resources that the union represented more than 60% of the workforce.
Canon has filed a challenge in the High Court.
Until the matter is decided in court, which the MTUC says could take between five and ten years, the employer is not required to recognise the union and can refuse to commence collective bargaining.
By the end of 2008 most members had stopped paying their union fees.
Inefficient labour courts: So far, the government has failed to apply any sanctions against employers who have opposed its directives granting trade union recognition or who have refused to comply with industrial court orders to reinstate illegally dismissed workers.
In some cases, companies have used tactics such as changing their name to thwart workers' legal efforts.
Prohibition on migrant workers forming or leading trade unions: The approximately 2.6 million migrant workers in Malaysia (25% of total workforce) are prevented by law from organising or applying to register a trade union and are barred from serving as officers of the trade union.
The MTUC claims that companies intimidate migrant workers to prevent them from joining the union and then use the fact that they are not members to deny recognition to unions by claiming they have the support of less than 50% of the workforce.
Notices placed on migrant work permits state that these workers are prohibited to join unions.
The system for registering migrant workers discourages workers from asserting their rights because it grants total discretion to employers to terminate workers for virtually any reason.
Migrant workers: Employers have interpreted the IRA and TUA provisions regarding migrant workers to mean that migrant workers are forbidden to join unions.
The MHA has declined repeated appeals by the MTUC to make a judgment on the employers' interpretation of this MHA policy.
Employers have proceeded to write the restrictions on association into migrant worker contracts, and the MHA has taken no steps to prevent this.
Furthermore, violation of the terms of the contract can be punished by dismissal, which in turn leads to revocation of the migrant's work permit and initiation of deportation proceedings.
The threat of firing and deportation prompts great fear in migrant workers, who have become reluctant to join in workers' mutual support and assistance efforts.
Eight Indian workers who were legally employed in a factory in Shah Alam in Malaysia became illegal workers when they complained to the Industrial Court claiming they were underpaid.
Their employer immediately cancelled their work permits and classified them as illegal workers.
Domestic workers: no rights and an abundance of abuse: Many of the approximately 400,000 primarily Indonesian domestic workers in Malaysia experience withheld wages, forced confinement and excessively long working hours without days off; some face physical and sexual abuse.
Domestic workers are excluded from key provisions of Malaysia's 1955 Employment Act, and their work permits tie them to a particular employer, making it difficult to report abuse for fear of deportation.
Cases of severe physical abuse of migrant domestic workers continue to be reported.
In September 2008 a Malaysian employer forced an Indonesian domestic worker to drink boiling water.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Mali
The unfair dismissal of strikers continued, including that of 100 strikers from the Morilla gold-mining company, as well as unfair transfers.
Several trade unions have complained of the lack of social dialogue and discrimination by the authorities.
Although basic trade union rights are recognised in law, a number of excessive restrictions still apply.
Both the 1992 Labour Code and the 2002 Law on the General Status of the Civil Servants allow workers to form and join unions, including non-nationals but excluding top managers of the Banque Centrale des Etats de l'Afrique de l'Ouest.
Collective bargaining is guaranteed for both private and public sector workers.
All workers have the right to strike, including civil servants, and there are no restrictions as to the form of the strike.
However, Article L.229 of the Labour Code grants the Minister of Labour the right to refer strikes to compulsory arbitration if they are liable to "jeopardize the normal operation of the national economy or involves a vital industrial sector".
Furthermore, the categories of workers required to provide a minimum service during a strike include school principals.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Government promises much, does little: Despite the government's promises, the trade unions have complained of the lack of social dialogue or at the very least discrimination against them.
Similarly, promises to deal with violations of the right to strike in 2009 or earlier amounted to nothing.
Many workers who took part in protest action have still not won their case, be it in the private sector (see the articles about Morilla and Huicoma in the violations section) or the public sector.
The National Health and Social Action Workers' Union (SNS-AS) called a 48-hour strike on 21 and 22 July further to the Health Minister's refusal to respond to their demands.
The SNS-AS reported that it had been threatened by the authorities.
The union's demands included the reinstatement of activists who had been transferred or dismissed for going on strike in the past.
By the end of the year, there had been no significant progress for the SNS-AS.
One of the country's two national centres excluded from the principal tripartite body: The Workers' Trade Union Confederation of Mali (CSTM) has repeatedly deplored the authorities' blatant disregard for it.
On 8 December, it organised a march to protest at its exclusion from the Economic, Social and Cultural Council (CESC) whose members were appointed on 30 November for a five-year term.
It is the third time the CSTM has not been included in the principal national consultative body, despite rulings by the Supreme Court.
The Ministry of Labour prepared this Guidebook for all expatriates recruited for work in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to provide them with basic information on the Kingdom and to clarify the provisions of the Labour Law, the regulations & decisions rendered pursuant to it which define the relationship between the worker and the employer in order to create a suitable environment for expatriate workers, to maintain their rights, to establish a proper relationship between the two parties and to make better understanding of the labour market in the Kingdom.

A worker may not be placed on probation for more than one time with one employer.
Except that, a worker may be subjected to an other period of probation for no more than 90 days upon agreement of the contract parties, provided that it shall be in an other job.
If the contract is terminated during the period of probation, no party shall be entitled to compensation and the worker shall have no right in service award for the period of probation.
1- A worker may not actually work for more than eight hours a day or more than forty-eight hours a week.
Working hours may be increased or decreased by the consent of the Ministry of Labour in accordance with the Labour Law depending on the type of activity and work nature.

The time of a worker's movement from his residence to the work place, periods of rest and prayers shall not be computed in working hours.
2- The employer shall pay the worker for overtime working hours an additional amount equal to the hourly wage plus 50% of his basic wage (i.e.
additional working hour wage shall be 150%).
4- After completing one year of work with the employer a worker shall be entitled to a prepaid annual leave of not less than twenty one days, to be increased to a period of not less than thirty days if the worker spends five consecutive years in the service of the employer.
The worker and the employer may agree upon a period more than stated above if it is stipulated in the work contract or in the firm work organization regulation.
The employer shall have the right to determine the beginning of his employees' vacations according to the work requirement.

The probable date of delivery shall be determined by the physician of the firm or pursuant to a medical report certified by a health authority.
A woman may not work during the six weeks immediately following delivery.
During the maternity leave, an employer shall pay the female worker half her wage if she has been in his service for one year or more, and a full wage if she has served for three years or more as of the date of commencement of such leave.
When a female worker returns to work following a maternity leave, she shall be entitled, in addition to the rest periods granted to all workers, to a rest period or periods not exceeding in aggregate one hour a day for nursing her infant.
An employer shall be responsible for the costs of medical test, treatment and delivery.
An employer may not terminate the employment of a female worker or give her a warning of the same while on maternity leave.

The retirement age may be reduced in cases of early retirement as provided for in the work organization regulation.
If it is a fixed term work contract which extends beyond the retirement age, it shall terminate at the end of its term.
If the worker fails to perform his essential obligations arising from the work contract, or to obey legitimate orders, or if, in spite of written warnings, he deliberately fails to observe the instructions related to the safety of work and workers as may be posted by the employer in a prominent place.
If the employer or his representative resorts to fraud at the time of contracting with respect to the work conditions and circumstances.
After the work contract expiry, a worker shall- in principle- return to his country after he obtains all his rights.

In case any national recruitment office collects any money from any expatriate worker as recruitment charges, the worker shall notify the nearest labour office in the Kingdom of that in order to take the necessary procedure against the owner of the concerned office, as these offices are banned from collecting any charges from expatriate workers in accordance with the provisions of the Labour Law and the instructions organizing the work of national recruitment offices.
Compliance with all obligations imposed by the Labour Law, the Social Insurance Law, the Regulations and Decisions rendered in implementation thereof.
Part eight: Labour offices and the Commissions for Settlement of Labour Disputes:
Labour Offices shall consider all labour disputes and try to settle them amicably between the worker and the employer.

These Commissions are:
1- the Preliminary Commissions for Settlement of Labour Disputes;
2- the High Commission for Settlement of Labour Disputes.
2008 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Mali
Right to strike: All workers, including civil servants, have the right to strike, and all types of strikes are allowed.
Those required to provide a minimum service during a strike include school principals, who fall outside the ILO definition of essential services.
Collective bargaining: Both the private and the public sector have the right to collective bargaining.
A collective agreement under limited duration is valid for a maximum of five years.
However, once this term expires, and without contradictory stipulations, the agreement is then considered of unlimited duration.
Trade union rights in practice and Violations in 2007
The Confédération syndicale des travailleurs du Mali (CSTM) reports that it is continuing to be discriminated against by the Malian authorities.
It is excluded from the civil service board (Conseil Superieur de la Fonction Publique), from the board of administrators of the Agence Nationale pour l'Emploi (ANPE) and the Institut Nationale de Prévoyance Sociale (INPS), and from the Socio-Economic and Cultural Board, in violation of decisions of the Supreme Court of Mali.
Government obstructing collective bargaining at federal level: Although collective bargaining is legally guaranteed, in practice, the government refuses to open negotiations on a federal collective agreement on trade which exists since 1956, as well as on the collective agreements on building and public works, on general mechanics, and on the Catholic education sector (whose current collective agreement dates back to 1969).
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Mauritania
Trade unions who did not declare their allegiance to the post-coup government faced discrimination.
By the end of the year there was still no social dialogue.
Trade unions face serious obstacles due to overall restrictive labour laws.
Freedom of association is strictly regulated despite some initial guarantees.
Workers are free to form and join trade unions by virtue of the 2004 Labour Code.
However, prior authorisation from the government is required to register a union.
Only workers' representatives within companies are protected against anti-union discrimination, and reinstatement for arbitrary dismissals is not available.
Collective bargaining is severely circumscribed, since the Ministry for the Civil Service and Labour decides whether or not an organisation may engage in negotiations, and can even participate in the preparation of collective agreements.
The head of government also decides how collective bargaining is organised at the national level.
Furthermore, although the right to strike is recognised, cumbersome procedures must be exhausted before a legal strike can be called.
Civil service unions must give one month's notice prior to a strike, and all strikes can be declared illegal by the public authorities, without the possibility of appeal.
The list of "essential services" is also bloated.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Social dialogue at a standstill: Social dialogue at the national level came to a standstill after the 2008 coup d'Etat.
On 27 December the three principal national centres called for the resumption of negotiations between the social partners, deploring the deterioration in the living conditions of workers and their families.
The trend of recent years continued: Employers are very reticent to deal with trade unions.
In general negotiations only take place if there is a dispute.
In many enterprises, freedom of association is systematically undermined, usually through interference by the employers.
This is frequently the case in the private sector where trade union delegates are vulnerable, all the more so given the increasing tendency to sub-contract.
Ineffective labour inspection: The enforcement of rights is complicated by the fact that labour inspectors have few means at their disposal and corruption is rife.
Some have to cover regions that extend over 6,000 square kilometres, without a telephone or car.
Even when a dispute breaks out, labour inspections are limited to voluntary conciliation.
When a union takes the matter to a higher level, the legal environment is such that court rulings are often contradictory and sometimes completely ignored by companies.
The procedures for settling disputes have also become increasingly lengthy and complex.
The Labour Code allows 30 days for conciliation, 120 days for mediation and 90 days for arbitration.
Thus, in certain cases it will take seven or eight months to complete the procedure for settling a dispute.
May Day celebrations under tight surveillance: The government encouraged a dissident wing of the Mauritanian Workers' Union (UTM), one of the three organisations affiliated to the ITUC.
At the end of April, the national television channel, controlled by the junta, broadcast a programme on the labour world in which some UMT members who had been won over by the junta spoke.
The independent national trade union centres had agreed to take part in the programme on the condition that it would be broadcast live to avoid any censorship, but that was refused.
The UTM criticised the participation of the dissident faction in the official May Day celebrations, which were also boycotted by the General Workers Confederation of Mauritania (CGTM) and the Free Workers' Confederation of Mauritania (CLTM), the other two national centres affiliated to the ITUC and in favour, like the UTM, of a return to democracy.
Some workers were even forced by their employers (some public enterprises) to take part in the official celebrations, while the loyalist trade unions, meeting together as the Democratic Trade Union Centres Coordination (CCSD) marched under tight military surveillance in different parts of the capital.
Dismissed for trade union membership: In August the company MPSS, a labour management company for the Portugues Do Amega road transport group, dismissed 10 workers.
According to the Free Workers' Confederation of Mauritania (CLTM) it was in retaliation for their trade union membership.
2007 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Mauritania
Restrictions on freedom of association: The current Labour Code was introduced by Act 2004/017 of 6 July 2004.
All workers, except members of the military and police, and most recently of the judiciary (see below), are free to form and join trade unions.
However, Articles 275 and 276 of the Labour Code constitute a breach of freedom of association and the protection of union rights, as they give the government the power to decide whether or not to recognise a trade union, while the Office of the Public Prosecutor has to authorise all trade unions.
Unions have no legal status until they receive that approval.
At present, non-Mauritanian nationals do not have the right to become trade union officials unless, as the Labour Code requires, they have worked in Mauritania and in the profession represented by the trade union, for a period of at least five years.
Protection of trade union leaders is not explicitly provided for in the Labour Code, although it is conferred on workers' delegates within companies.
Labour courts are not allowed to overturn decisions and reinstate workers who have been arbitrarily dismissed.
This provision will therefore benefit the employers.
Obstacles to the right to strike: The right to strike is recognised.
Civil service unions have to give one month's notice before holding a strike.
In the private sector they must provide official notification that conciliation procedures have broken down.
Executive and managerial staff are not allowed to strike.
The Labour Code also restricts strikes in sectors that are not covered by the ILO definition of "essential services".
Prior authorisation rarely granted: Unions have reported that authorisation for a trade union to exist and operate is rarely granted.
Applications are consistently blocked at the registry of the Public Prosecutor.
Numerous employers refuse to create workers' representation bodies.
Pressures by private employers: The unions have also reported that trade union organisations are not free to carry out their activities normally, as they regularly come up against obstacles and pressure from the government.
Unionised workers are subjected daily to all kinds of pressure and discriminatory measures, such as arbitrary dismissals – in particular for exercising the right to strike.
Workers are occasionally imprisoned, tortured and then dismissed, purely on the grounds of employers' complaints of supposed wrong doing at the workplace.
Ineffective labour inspection: The enforcement of rights is complicated by the fact that labour inspectors have few means at their disposal and corruption is rife.
Some have to cover regions that extend over 6,000 square kilometres, without a telephone or car.
Even when a dispute breaks out, labour inspections are limited to voluntary conciliation.
When a union takes the matter to a higher level, the legal environment is such that court rulings are often contradictory and sometimes completely ignored by companies.
Also, the procedures for settling disputes have become increasingly lengthy and complex.
The Labour Code allows 30 days for conciliation, 120 days for mediation and 90 days for arbitration.
Thus, in certain cases it will take seven or eight months to complete the procedure for settling a conflict.
Fourteen union leaders arrested during strike: When the National Trade Union of Bakeries (Syndicat national des Boulangeries), affiliated to the CGTM, called a strike on 12 April 2006, 97 percent of all bakery workers in the capital responded.
They went on strike in support of a set of very basic demands, including proper employment contracts, pay slips, social security cover and the respect of weekly breaks and annual leave.
Although the strike was called legally, 14 union leaders were arrested and kept in custody for at least 48 hours without food or contact.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Mexico
The government continues to pursue overtly anti-union policies.
The mining, metal and electricity sectors were the worst affected.
Four members of the national miners' and metalworkers' union, Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores Mineros, Metalúrgicos y Similares de la República Mexicana (SNTMMSRM), lost their lives at the hands of police brutality.
A leader of the Puerto de Veracruz commercial and maritime workers' union, Sindicato de Maniobristas, Carretilleros, Cargadores, Abridores, Conexos de la Zona Marítima y del Comercio de la Ciudad y Puerto de Veracruz, was murdered and the head of the workers' and campesino union, Unión General Obrera, Campesina y Popular (UGOCP), and his family were slaughtered.
The law provides little scope for the exercise of free trade unionism and public workers' trade union rights are extremely limited.
Despite some initial guarantees, there are many restrictions on trade union rights in the law.
While workers may join and form trade unions, to obtain legal status the unions must be listed in the Register of Associations.
The authorities may decline to "take note" of a request if they consider that the union has breached or does not meet the requirements established in the Federal Labour Law.
In the public sector, the law imposes a trade union monopoly on state employees, as all workers are obliged to join unions affiliated to the public service union, the FSTSE.
There is also a trade union monopoly in the banking sector, where bank workers may only belong to the National Federation of Banking Unions.
State employees are not allowed to leave their union either, and they lose their job if they do.
Furthermore, while the right to strike is recognised in the Constitution, public service employees may only call a strike in the event of general and systematic violations of their rights.
They must also have the support of two thirds of the workers in the public body concerned.
In addition, the law enables the government to requisition workers in a national emergency, including when it is caused by an industrial dispute.
The National Banking Commission determines the extent of the minimum service in the banking sector without any union involvement.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Protection contracts: "Employer protection contracts" continue to exist.
They have been described by the Trade Union Confederation of the Americas (TUCA) as the "most grotesque product of the Mexican labour model".
These "protection contracts", that is, bogus collective agreements drawn up by the employers and negotiated behind the workers' backs, then filed with the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Board, constitute a violation of trade union rights, as they prevent any real collective bargaining and the possibility of exercising the right to strike.
The five sectors where these types of contracts are most common are the auto industry, supermarket chains, cleaning services, low cost airlines and the maquilas.
Trade union leader murdered: On 18 July, Jorge Luis Andrade Morales, Secretary of the Puerto de Veracruz commercial and dock workers' union, Sindicato de Maniobristas, Carretilleros, Cargadores, Abridores, Conexos de la Zona Marítima y del Comercio de la Ciudad y Puerto de Veracruz, was murdered after having given a press conference on 8 July in which he denounced the federal government's violations of human and labour rights through the Department of Labour and Social Security.
Arbitrary measures and use of force: On 10 October, armed troops and federal police officers dislodged and occupied the installations of the public utility company Compañía de Luz y Fuerza del Centro (LFC), which provides electricity to the central part of the country.
A Presidential Decree was passed to close the company and lay off its 44,000 employees, thus disbanding the trade union and obliterating the gains secured by the workers.
The government's main argument was that the company had become too costly because of the workers' high wages.
The Mexican electricians' union, Sindicato Mexicano de Electricistas (SME), filed a complaint against the Mexican government, arguing that the decree to close the company constitutes a violation of ILO Conventions 87 and 98.
In June, as part of an international campaign to improve labour rights in Mexico, a delegation of parliamentarians and trade union leaders from 13 countries, including the general secretaries of the International Federation of Chemical, Energy, Mine and General Workers' Unions (ICEM) and the International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF), joined with Mexican members of parliament and trade union leaders from the national workers' union UMT and the electricians' union SME, to call on the government to stop the persecution of the SNTMMSRM and its leader, Napoleón Gómez Urrutia, who has been forced to take exile in Canada.
The Canadian government has refused to extradite him.
"Purpose.
" The purpose of this section is to provide employees and their designated representatives a right of access to relevant exposure and medical records; and to provide representatives of the Assistant Secretary a right of access to these records in order to fulfill responsibilities under the Occupational Safety and Health Act.
Access by employees, their representatives, and the Assistant Secretary is necessary to yield both direct and indirect improvements in the detection, treatment, and prevention of occupational disease.
Each employer is responsible for assuring compliance with this section, but the activities involved in complying with the access to medical records provisions can be carried out, on behalf of the employer, by the physician or other health care personnel in charge of employee medical records.
Except as expressly provided, nothing in this section is intended to affect existing legal and ethical obligations concerning the maintenance and confidentiality of employee medical information, the duty to disclose information to a patient/employee or any other aspect of the medical-care relationship, or affect existing legal obligations concerning the protection of trade secret information.
This section applies to all employee exposure and medical records, and analyses thereof, of such employees, whether or not the records are mandated by specific occupational safety and health standards.
Is listed in the latest printed edition of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances (RTECS) which is incorporated by reference as specified in Sec.
1910.6; or
The medical records of employees who have worked for less than (1) year for the employer need not be retained beyond the term of employment if they are provided to the employee upon the termination of employment.
Biological monitoring results designated as exposure records by specific occupational safety and health standards shall be preserved and maintained as required by the specific standard.
In the absence of such directly relevant records, such records of other employees with past or present job duties or working conditions related to or similar to those of the employee to the extent necessary to reasonably indicate the amount and nature of the toxic substances or harmful physical agents to which the employee is or has been subjected, and
Exposure records to the extent necessary to reasonably indicate the amount and nature of the toxic substances or harmful physical agents at workplaces or under working conditions to which the employee is being assigned or transferred.
Each employer shall, upon request, assure the access of each employee and designated representative to each analysis using exposure or medical records concerning the employee's working conditions or workplace.
Each employer shall, upon request, and without derogation of any rights under the Constitution or the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, 29 U.S.C.
651 "et seq.," that the employer chooses to exercise, assure the prompt access of representatives of the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health to employee exposure and medical records and to analyses using exposure or medical records.
Rules of agency practice and procedure governing OSHA access to employee medical records are contained in 29 CFR 1913.10.
Each employer shall keep a copy of this section and its appendices, and make copies readily available, upon request, to employees.
The employer shall also distribute to current employees any informational materials concerning this section which are made available to the employer by the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health.
Transfer the records to the Director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) if so required by a specific occupational safety and health standard; or
2007 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Mexico
Two trade unionists were arbitrarily arrested.
The illegal dismissal of a trade union leader by the government led to a major demonstration by miners, followed by a strike, which was repressed and resulted in two deaths and 41 injuries.
Anti-union strategies are continuing to be deployed in the textile and electronics maquiladoras.
Registration of unions: No prior authorisation is required to create a trade union.
To obtain legal status, however, the unions must be registered in the Register of Associations, an office of the Labour and Social Protection Secretariat.
The authorities may decline to "take note" of a request if they consider that the union has breached or does not meet the requirements established in the Federal Labour Law (Ley Federal del Trabajo).
That judgement involves an examination of trade union procedures.
Although it is possible to appeal against an inspector's report, there is no legal recourse for changing it or requiring that a new inspection be carried out.
An unregistered union cannot call a strike or participate in collective agreements, and is excluded from all tripartite committees.
Foreigners may not become members of trade union executive bodies.
Restrictions in the public sector: The law imposes a trade union monopoly on State employees, prohibiting the coexistence of two or more unions in the same State body.
Workers are obliged to join unions affiliated to the public service union, the Federación de Sindicatos de Trabajadores al Servicio del Estado (FSTSE).
State employees may not leave their union.
Public sector trade union officials may not stand for re-election.
The law also imposes a trade union monopoly on bank workers, who may only belong to the National Federation of Banking Unions.
Restrictions on right to strike: Clause XVIII of Article 123 of the Mexican Constitution states that "strikes shall be legal when their purpose is to establish equilibrium between the diverse factors of production, harmonising the rights of labour with those of capital.
In the public services workers shall be required to provide ten days' notice to the conciliation and arbitration board (Junta de Conciliación y Arbitraje, JCA), of the proposed date on which work is to be suspended.
Strikes shall be regarded as illegal only where the majority of the strikers carry out violent attacks on persons or property, or, in the event of war, where the former belong to government bodies and departments".
Employees in the public service may only call a strike in the event of the general and systematic violation of their rights set out in the Constitution.
They must have the support of two thirds of the workers in the public body concerned.
The law also enables the government to requisition workers in a national emergency, including when it is caused by an industrial dispute.
Trade union monopoly, protection contracts and exclusion clauses: The Supreme Court of Justice ruled in 1999 that the imposition of a trade union monopoly in the public sector was a violation of the freedom of association as set out in the Constitution.
The government has yet to bring the law into line with this ruling.
Deficiencies in the Federal Employment Law have been exploited in order to create false collective agreements called "protection contracts".
These contracts consist of an agreement whereby the company pays a monthly sum to the union.
In exchange, the union guarantees industrial peace.
The exclusion clauses in these protection contracts give pro-management unions the right to demand the dismissal of certain workers.
These clauses are often used to obtain the illegal dismissal of workers who prefer free trade unions.
It has been noted that most protection contracts are signed by lawyers' clients who represent so called trade unions.
There are even websites containing "model contracts" that employers simply need to modify.
Precarious contracts: Many education, media, government agency and maquiladora workers, and the researchers at the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia, are employed through "civil contracts for the provision of professional services" and are obliged, in some instances, to sign a declaration to acknowledge that these are not employment contracts.
Under these terms, they are not legally permitted to organise or join a union, can only become members of civil associations, and do not have the right to take strike action or negotiate collective agreements.
Maquiladoras: opposition to the establishment of democratic trade unions: Maquiladoras are continuing to exploit local workforces and increasing numbers of indigenous workers are swelling the ranks of this category of insecure workers.
Whilst depicted as a "necessary evil" for reducing unemployment, maquiladoras are characterised by unpaid overtime, sexual harassment, discrimination in employment, non-existent health and safety precautions, unfair dismissals and the denial of any organising rights.
The dismissal of pregnant women workers is also endemic.
The sub-contracting of women workers is frequently used as a means of avoiding any responsibilities.
Blacklists containing the names of trade unionists who should not be recruited are regularly passed around the factories.
The sector is currently facing the worst crisis in its history, since hundreds of maquiladoras have fled Mexico to set up operations in China or Central America.
Violation of trade union autonomy: Establishing an independent trade union, in other words a union that is not controlled by the employers, can resemble an obstacle course.
The difficulties associated with obtaining legal status are used by the government to deny a union the right to register or to give preference to a particular union leader over another.
Another type of interference in trade union autonomy is when the government itself intervenes in decisions to appoint or dismiss trade union leaders.
Undermining of the right to strike: Every year, thousands of strikes are called, of which only 0.3 per cent go ahead.
The Labour Secretary claims that this is an indication of "industrial peace".
In reality, the explanation lies in the complexity of the mechanisms for calling a strike and the workers' lack of confidence that the State will fulfil its obligation to defend the right to strike.
In addition, employers often turn to the local conciliation and arbitration boards (JLCAs) to request that strikes be declared illegal, accusing the organisers of violating their own union statutes.
The government was, in effect, legitimising violence as a means of resolving political and social disputes.
Thus, labour activists and trade unionists in particular found that their struggles to defend their rights and demands were putting their freedom of expression and assembly and even their physical integrity at risk.
Within that insecure environment, trade union action was undermined by the threats to the activists' jobs and their lives.
Arrests and attacks on union leaders: At the start of the year, Martín Barrios Hernández, the Chairman of the Human and Trade Union Rights Committee of Tehuacan was still imprisoned in Puebla.
He was released on 12 January, two weeks after being arrested by the state police after being accused of blackmail by the owner of the maquiladora Calidad de Confecciones SA de CV (see 2006 Survey).
Many labour activists around the world had signed a petition to the governor of Puebla to drop the charges against Barrios, who had helped the workers at the company organise themselves and defend their rights.
Dismissal of a union leader violates trade union autonomy: On 17 February, the General Secretary of the national miners' union SNTMMSRM, Napoleón Gómez Urrutia, was dismissed from his post on the orders of Minister of Labour Francisco Javier Salazar, who proceeded to impose the appointment of Elías Morales Hernández.
The government also froze the bank accounts of the union, without taking the correct legal measures in such cases.
There were a number of other illegal or irregular practices deployed in this case, such as the forging of the signature of one of the members of the executive committee, in a document supporting the appointment of the new leader.
These events, which were clear examples of direct government interference in trade union affairs, which amounts to violation of trade union autonomy, provoked a wave of protests by miners across the country.
Right to strike violated through a mixture of repression, murders and intimidation: Two miners died and 41 were injured, including two seriously, following the brutal evacuation on 20 April of the mining company Lázaro Cárdenas Las Truchas (Sicartsa), where the workers had been on strike and holding a sit-in since 2 April demanding the recognition of the trade union leader Napoleón Gómez Urrutia and the withdrawal of that recognition from the imposed leader.
In a disproportionate attack, 800 federal and state police were sent to confront around 500 workers.
One of the workers who died was Héctor Álvarez Gómez, a trade union representative on the joint committee at Mittal Steel.
Employees of the Federal Workers' Council (Junta Obrera Federal) complained in late November that 100 armed police has turned up threaten workers who were planning a one hour stoppage to denounce the violation of their rights.
The workers were complaining because wage increases had been frozen and other benefits had been cut.
They were also trying to obtain legal recognition of their collective agreement.
Widespread violence and a governance crisis in Oaxaca: Throughout the second half of the year a series of labour, human rights and international and national trade union organisations have condemned the wave of repression against the organisations protesting in Oaxaca.
Those organisations include the National Education Workers Union (SNTE), via their representatives in local branches, who have led these actions jointly with the Popular Assembly of the Peoples of Oaxaca in support of their demands for more state investment to strengthen public education.
The government has not been seeking peaceful forms of negotiation or dialogue but has instead been making excessive use of the police forces to suppress all the demonstrations; dozens of arrests have been reported and at least three people have died as a result of the uncontrolled violence.
Anti-union campaign at the Children's Hospital in Puebla: On 25 March, the union at the Children's Hospital in Puebla complained about a campaign comprising unfair dismissals, threats, harassment and failure to apply the collective agreement.
Two members of the union were dismissed.
One of them was locked in an office for a number of hours and forced to sign a letter leaving the union.
She was also threatened with being accused of having been responsible for the death of a patient.
The independent trade union at the Lajat factory in Gómez Palacios won a court case concerning the unfair dismissal of 56 workers in November 2005 (see 2006 Survey) and also gained official recognition of the trade union.
However, the workers will not be reinstated as the factory has already closed down.
Workers' and trade union rights violated in the electronics industry: The Workers' Study and Action Centre CEREAL had received 578 complaints from workers by September concerning violations of workers' rights in companies including HP, Dell, IBM, Intel, Nokia, Philips, Sony Ericsson, Motorola, IBM and Sony.
The most common breaches included cutting back collective agreements and obstructing collective bargaining together with cases of discrimination, exposure to toxic substances, sexual harassment and other forms of ill-treatment.
De-recognition of the leadership of a union: The Conciliation and Arbitration Tribunal (TCAE) agreed to reject the results of the elections of the civil servants' union STPE, without hearing the views of the elected leadership.
The union that had lost the elections had sent a letter to the TCAE on 28 May contesting the new leadership.
The ruling meant that the Executive Committee was not recognised, which provoked criticism from the World Confederation of Labour and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, who saw this as a discriminatory and biased move, undermining the trade union representatives chosen by 4,300 workers.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Morocco
Organising workers in trade unions is still difficult, particularly in the export processing zones.
The right to strike is suppressed in almost all sectors of activity.
Workers and activists are threatened and often punished for demanding better working conditions and the reinstatement of colleagues dismissed for striking.
Although constitutional guarantees for freedom of association are in place, it is restricted by provisions in the Labour Code.
Certain categories of workers are not allowed to form trade unions, including public servants, members of the judiciary, domestic workers and agricultural workers, and all union officials must be of Moroccan nationality.
Collective bargaining is confined to the most representative union, which must represent at least 35% of the total number of employees at the enterprise level.
Despite the fact that the right to strike is guaranteed in the Constitution, employers are permitted to seek criminal prosecution of any strikers who hold a sit-in, damage property or carry out active picketing.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Social dialogue blocked as government retaliates to public sector strikes: The national trade union centres deplored the hardening of the government's attitude to the right to strike, demonstrated for example when it docked wages across the board during the public sector strikes.
The decision was taken on 9 February on the eve of a demonstration organised by the national centres, the second of the year, following that of 27 January.
The unions denounced the unfair decision, point out that their action was in response to the lack of social dialogue.
In October the trade unions asked for the notice period for strike action to be reduced, as legislative reforms were due to set it at 10 days.
The government also refused to negotiate any pay rises before 2011.
Trade union members and strikers dismissed in the farming sector: Following a strike on 19 and 21 January by workers at the Maraissa 15 farm, owned by the Franco-Moroccan group Azura, 24 employees including several members of the National Agriculture Sector Federation (FNSA) affiliated to the Moroccan Labour Union (UMT) were dismissed.
The employer also prosecuted six strikers for violating the right to work, even though the strike had been organised legally.
The trade union activists reported that working conditions were deplorable.
There is little respect for the right to strike in the farming sector.
In 2008 several FNSA activists were dismissed by another company (see the 2009 Survey).
Repression of UMT delegates: The Moroccan Labour Union (UMT) reported many cases of repression against its members.
In the textile sector, the union executive at both Fruit of the Loom (Salé) and Canada Diffusion (Casablanca) was dismissed as soon as they took office.
In the building and wood working sector, management at the 10 Rajeb and Cima Bois companies in Casablanca did the same.
In the pharmaceutical industry, Sofaca in Casablanca harassed members of the union executive.
From 3 to 5 December, 300 employees at two Metro hypermarkets in Casablanca went on strike in protest at the dismissal of a manager for his membership of the UMT, and in support of demands for recognition of temporary agents and for pay rises.
Negotiations led to a memorandum of understanding, the suspension of the decision to dismiss the manager and the inclusion of a draft collective agreement on the social partners' agenda.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Mozambique
Trade unions are rarely accepted at the workplace.
Activists are harassed and collective agreements constantly violated.
Public servants still do not have the right to organise, and the right to strike is restricted.
Free trade union activity is hindered by a number of restrictions.
Public servants do not have the right to form and join unions.
However, a general law on public servants has been drafted to allow these workers to exercise freedom of association though the draft still excludes some categories of workers, and provides for cumbersome dispute resolution procedures.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Employers – good intentions collectively, ignoring rights individually: Although the Mozambican Workers' Organisation (OTM-CS) considers relations with the social partners are good at the national level, it has asked to be involved more closely in Civil Service pay reforms, recalling the lack of transparency that has prevailed hitherto.
At the enterprise level, performance is not so good: the trade unions have not been able to develop.
Employers have continued to show their hostility towards workers' representatives: anti-union discrimination remains a problem as the 2007 Labour Code does not contain sufficiently dissuasive sanctions , while the legal constraints on private gatherings and workers' meetings at the work place are very strict.
Collective agreements are rare and constantly violated, which has led to several industrial disputes.
At G4S and several of its subsidiaries the Private Security Workers' Union has carried out several strikes following blatant violations of the collective agreement, despite the involvement of the labour inspector.
Discrimination in the export processing zones: The Mozambique Workers' Organisation (OTM-CS) has complained of discrimination against trade unionists in the export processing zones (EPZ): dismissals of activists and members, violations of collective agreements where they exist,etc.
Furthermore the right to strike is very difficult to exercise in practice as the zones are covered by the law on essential services.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Namibia
A miners' union leader was sacked for his activism, while six fishing company workers were arrested for defying an injunction that effectively prevented them from picketing.
Although basic trade union rights are secured, excessive restrictions apply to the right to strike.
Problems remain in the labour legislation despite recent improvements.
The Constitution and the 2007 Labour Act guarantee freedom of association, but exclude prison staff.
In addition, the Labour Commissioner may cancel the registration of a trade union if it fails to comply with its legal obligations, although the decision may be appealed in court.
Furthermore, the right to bargain collectively is recognised for registered trade unions that represent the majority of the employees in a bargaining unit.
Finally, the right to strike is limited, as strike action can only be initiated in disputes that involve specific workers' interests, such as pay rises.
Strikes are also subject to a long conciliation procedure.
Disputes over workers' rights, including dismissals, must be referred to the Labour Court for arbitration, and the dispute solving mechanisms are long and cumbersome.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Discrimination against independent trade unions: Trade unions not affiliated with the ruling SWAPO (South West Africa People's Organisation) party have continued to be marginalised.
Only representatives of the National Union of Namibian Workers (NUNW) serve as members of the Board of Directors of the Social Security Commission and the Government Institution Pension Fund.
Employer hostility: Employers have a history of being generally very hostile towards the unions, refusing to recognise them or let them carry out their activities in workplaces, or to engage in collective bargaining with them.
This tendency has been particularly prevalent in the export processing zones.
The categories most vulnerable to trade union rights' violations are farm and domestic workers.
2008 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Mozambique
Non-compliance with international labour standards: The ILO's Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR) has observed that the draft Code in its Section 189 provided for compulsory arbitration in case of essential services, however this included services not essential in the strict sense of the term, such as postal services, the petroleum sector, meteorological services, and loading and unloading of cattle and perishable goods.
The provisions in the code concerning the right to strike also need to be amended to bring it up to ILO standards, removing the time limit on the right to strike and ensuring that responsibility for declaring a strike illegal lies with an independent authority.
Trade union rights in practice and Violations in 2007
Employers block union activity: The OTM-CS has in recent years reported frequent trade union rights' violations by employers who try to stop the unions from protecting their workers, and do not comply with collective agreements or with state legislation to protect them from being sacked.
Union officials are threatened with dismissal, and union members have been dismissed under false pretences.
Employers also carry out misinformation campaigns about unions and prevent organisers from entering premises to carry out recruitment campaigns.
Unionists discriminated against in export processing zones: Unionists face discrimination and unfair dismissal, and workers are dismissed for going on strike.
Collective agreements are not respected, nor is the principle of equal pay for equal work.
Collective bargaining rights flouted: In July, the 25 employees of the engineering firm Vulcan Iron Works in Maputo went on strike in protest at their employer's failure to honour the collective agreement, which stipulates that negotiations should take place each year to discuss possible improvements to working conditions and wages.
The workers at this engineering workshop are, in fact, in a somewhat exceptional position.
A report by the Ministry of Labour on inspections showed that of the 522 companies visited just 16 had signed a collective agreement with their employees.
The least fortunate include the employees of Golden Roses, a horticultural firm, who held a protest in October in Moamba to ask the local authorities to get their employer to negotiate with them.
The hundred or so workers had been recruited in distant provinces to replace others who had preferred to leave their jobs owing to the awful working conditions.
Having been alerted, the Chief Labour Inspector was refused entry to the company.
Later on, with police assistance, he succeeded in entering the site but the manager refused to meet him.
The Labour Inspectorate subsequently closed the company down.
Striker killed by security guards in a plantation: On 16 July, Domingos Chanjane, a 23-year old agricultural worker was killed by a bullet wound and three others were injured, including two seriously, when a strike was suppressed at the sugar cane plantation in Mafambisse (Sofala province).
The plantation's security guards used rubber bullets to break up the crowd of strikers, who claim not to have been seeking confrontation.
Shortly after these dramatic events, the police turned up and managed to calm down the angry strikers.
The workers say that the person who shot their colleague is called Cardoso Equivale, the head of security and also a member of the local police, which the provincial authorities deny.
It should be stressed that Domingos Chanjane was hit by real bullets.
The strike had started a few hours earlier, in protest at the non-application of the agreements reached between the management and the national sugar industry union (Sinidicato National dos trabalhadores da industria do acucar, SINTIA) on improving the working conditions of the 4,000 seasonal workers.
At the end of the year it seems the investigation was not yet over.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Nepal
Although basic trade union rights are guaranteed, excessive restrictions apply.
The right to freedom of association is established in both the interim Constitution of 2007 and the Labour Act, but non-nationals may not be elected as trade union officials.
The thresholds for union formation as well as for the creation of federations and confederations are excessively high, and a maximum of four unions are allowed per enterprise.
Workers, including civil servants, have the right to join a union and to bargain collectively, and the latter right has also been extended to federations and confederations.
However, the right to strike is limited, and the government may stop a strike or suspend a trade union's activities if the strike disturbs the peace or is deemed to adversely affect the interests of the nation.
Also, to call a strike, 60% of the union's membership must agree on the action in a secret ballot, and the union must announce the strike at least 30 days in advance.
Strikes are banned for workers in charge of security or surveillance teams in a company and for workers in "essential services", which are broadly defined to include sectors such as banking and hotels.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Ratification of Convention 87 on the horizon?
: In July pressure from the trade union movement and the ILO led to commitments from prominent Nepalese political figures in favour of the ratification of ILO Convention 87 on freedom of association and protection of the right to organise.
By the end of 2009 however, Nepal had still not ratified this international standard.
Trade unions set up joint platform despite tensions: Despite attacks on their members at the hands of the Maoist All Nepal Federation of Trade Unions (ANFTU), the democratic trade unions, including the Nepal Trade Union Congress – Independent (NTUC-I) and General Federation of Nepalese Trade Unions (GEFONT) decided to hold talks with them in order to reach a consensus on progressive reform of labour legislation.
An inter-union Coordination Council was set up, a joint platform of the representatives of seven trade unions, one of whose key tasks is to reduce acts of violence.
Seven trade union leaders released on bail: The General Federation of Nepalese Trade Unions (GEFONT) reported that in April the management of the "Women Uplift Center – Mahila Utthan Center" tried to fire the union's new leader, after dismissing two other union leaders in 2008.
(A complaint concerning these two dismissals is still being examined).
According to GEFONT, management also hired thugs to damage office equipment, then accused the trade union of being responsible for the damage.
Four trade union leaders were arrested and three others had to report to the police station.
They were all released on bail.
Faced with continued protests outside the centre, management finally agreed to reinstate all the dismissed workers and to recognise the union.
A new collective agreement was signed.
The complaint concerning the destruction of office equipment is still being dealt with however.
Beijing Hotel uses extreme violence against its workers: According to the General Federation of Nepalese Trade Unions (GEFONT), shortly after their union was registered, workers at the Beijing Hotel (Thamel district, Katmandou) submitted a list of demands to management, in June.
The latter refused to consider the demands and promptly dismissed 35 people.
When the workers began a strike picket outside the hotel, management responded by violently attacking them with knives, sticks, stones and beer bottles.
Many workers and union leaders were seriously injured.
22 hospital workers reinstated further to pressure from German donors: In June, 22 workers were dismissed by the Sushma Koirala Memorial hospital after registering their union.
According to the General Federation of Nepalese Trade Unions (GEFONT), all the workers at the hospital were on fixed-term contracts.
Initially the hospital management claimed it was simply a question of the non-renewability of contracts.
However, given that non-unionised workers had had their contracts renewed, GEFONT believed it was an act of anti-union discrimination and contacted the German donors who support the hospital.
The donors obliged management to rehire the dismissed workers.
The union was later recognised.
Attacks on democratic trade union activists: In March, TP Khanal, assistant general secretary of the Nepal Trade Union Congress – Independent (NTUC-I) and Krishna Pandey, one of the leaders of the Nepal Tourism, Hotel, Casino and Restaurant Workers' Union (NTHCWRU) and the union leader at a Katmandou casino, were beaten up by members of the Maoist union.
TP Khanal's injuries were so severe that he had to spend two weeks in hospital.
The NTUC-I has reported other cases of trade union activists being attacked and threatened in the embroidery industry and among other member unions such as the Nepal Factory Labour Union and the Nepal National Security Guards' Union.
NTUC-I members threatened: In December, Rajendra Khadka, the representative of the Nepal Tourism, Hotel, Casino and Restaurant Workers' Union (NTHCWRU), affiliated to the Nepal Trade Union Congress – Independent (NTUC-I), at the Hyatt Hotel, was threatened by Maoist activists who ordered him to stop his trade union activity or face physical reprisals and pressure to get him sacked.
NTUC-I general secretary sacked: Achuta Raj Pandey, general secretary of the Nepal Trade Union Congress-Independent (NTUC-I), was dismissed by the Soaltee hotel for irregular attendance at the workplace, despite being granted unpaid leave further to his appointment by the government as a member of the Constituent Assembly.
Birjung National Medical College dismisses at least three trade unionists: Faced with the Labour Ministry's refusal to register the workers' union of the National Medical College of Birjung (affiliated to the General Federation of Nepalese Trade Unions – GEFONT), the union's members carried out protest action.
Several of the union's members including three of its leaders were dismissed as a result.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Nicaragua
Despite the change in political direction, companies continue to violate trade union rights, especially foreign corporations, which exploit a variety of legal mechanisms to overturn any rights gained or to destabilise and destroy trade unions.
There are many restrictions on the right to strike.
Although basic trade union rights are guaranteed, some problematic areas exist in the law.
Workers have the right to form and join the trade union of their choice, as well as to bargain collectively.
While union leaders have protected status, this is limited to nine executive members per union and three branch members.
The Labour Code also allows the employer to dismiss any employee, including union organisers, provided that they have the permission of the Ministry of Labour and pay double the usual severance pay.
The fines for interfering in trade union affairs are not sufficiently dissuasive.
Furthermore, while the right to strike is recognised in the Constitution, a trade union must receive the approval of the Ministry of Labour before engaging in strike action.
Also, to be considered officially approved, a strike must have the support of at least 50% plus one of the members of the trade union, voting in an extraordinary general meeting.
Finally, the Labour Code provides for compulsory arbitration of a dispute where 30 days have elapsed since the calling of a strike.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Anti-union discrimination: In a communiqué dated 24 February, the national trade union confederation, Confederación de Unificación Sindical (CUS), reported that the Transport and Infrastructure Ministry had still not responded to the requests for a meeting with the trade unions representing the workers employed by this Ministry, despite repeated requests dating back to January 2007.
The CUS added that the government has not yet fulfilled the recommendations formulated by the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association in 2008 and continues to violate the clauses of the collective agreement in a number of areas, including contracting, dismissal procedures, facilities for trade unions (offices, etc.
), and the bilateral agreement with drivers, especially as regards pay reviews.
Companies oppose union organising: It is part of corporate culture to persistently oppose the free exercise of trade union rights, with the backing of professional advice from lawyers and managers.
Unionised workers speak of constant attacks, harassment and other forms of pressure aimed at forcing them to leave the union or the company.
Dismissals, including of trade unions' leaders or founding members, are the main strategy used to stop or prevent any attempts to organise.
Employers often offer workers financial incentives to leave the union, to weaken the organisation by stripping it of its members.
Employment relationships are changing and the increasing use of short-term or one-day contracts is making it impossible to increase union membership.
Tactics such as changing company name, although this may seem like a formality, are also used as a way of de-legitimising the union or replacing members of the management with anti-union "hardliners".
The export processing zones or maquilas continue to be the sector where the most workers' rights violations are committed.
Independent unions suffer harassment and discrimination: On 10 February, representatives of the Boaco and Chontales regional independent trade union confederation, Confederación Regional Sindical Independiente de Boaco y Chontales, and the hospital workers' union, Sindicato Independiente del Hospital Alemán Nicaragüense, denounced the Health Ministry for the harassment and discrimination levelled against independent unions.
The hospital management and the health workers' federation, Federación de Trabajadores de la Salud (FETSALUD), excluded the independent union from negotiations and signed a collective agreement scrapping a series of benefits enjoyed by the workers.
It is not the first time that this multinational has shown such strong opposition to unions.
In 2007, the united federation of food, agribusiness, tourism, service, commerce and allied workers, FUTATSCON, an IUF affiliate, managed to form a trade union of ENSA workers, SITRUENSA, but the organisation was dismantled within just months.
Employers renege on agreement with trade unions: In March, an agreement was reached between the unions, the CZF corporation in charge of EPZs and the Labour Ministry, whereby the workers would make concessions regarding the increase in the minimum wage to help employers cope with the crisis.
In exchange, the employers agreed to take every step necessary to avoid lay-offs.
The employers have totally disregarded the commitments made and the CZF completely failed in its attempt to ensure compliance with the tripartite agreement.
More dismissals at maquila companies: In October, workers at the maquiladora company VF-Jeanswear Nicaragua denounced the dismissal of nine workers, all members of a recently formed union.
The dismissed workers called on the José Benito Escobar trade union confederation, CST-JBE, to back their cause.
2009 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Nepal
An interim Constitution came into force in 2007.
The trade union movement managed to get a clause included stating that labour rights are fundamental rights and that, as provided in law, workers have the right to join unions and to bargain collectively.
In 2007 a verdict by the Supreme Court confirmed that the right to collective bargaining was not restricted to company unions but also applied to federations and confederations.
Members of the armed forces and the police are not allowed to form a union, however, and members of the management of private or public enterprises are not allowed to take part in union activities.
Non-Nepalese can be members of a union.
However, only Nepalese nationals can be elected as trade union officials.
Forming trade unions: At enterprise level, the formation of a union requires 25 per cent of the workforce and a minimum of ten people.
A maximum of four unions are allowed per enterprise.
The collective bargaining agent should be determined via elections within the enterprise.
Trade union federations can be formed through the association of 50 company unions, or of 5,000 individuals working in enterprises of the same nature.
This is a barrier high enough to be considered restrictive by international labour standards.
A confederation requires ten federations to join together, of which six must be from the formal economy.
Government restores public servants' right to belong to unions: In 2007, the government adopted a Civil Service Act restoring the right of civil servants to join a union and to bargain collectively.
Those rights had been revoked on 14 July 2005.
Strike restrictions: Although strikes are permitted, there are a series of restrictions.
A strike can be held, but only after 30 days' notice and following a secret ballot of 60 per cent of the union's membership, an excessively high figure according to international standards.
The government may stop a strike or suspend a trade union's activities if it disturbs the peace or is deemed to adversely affect the economic interests of the nation.
In addition, legislation denies the right to strike to employees providing essential services.
In recent years, the government has used that legislation to ban strikes in many sectors, including banking, telecommunications, electricity, water supply, road, air and sea transport, the print industry, the government, press, and hotels and restaurants.
This far exceeds the ILO definition of essential services.
A worker in charge of security or surveillance teams in a company is not allowed to start a strike either.
Reform of labour law: In 2006 and 2007 the government began to reform the country's labour and industrial relations law, with technical support from the ILO and involvement of trade unions and employers' organisations.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2008
Killing of two trade unionists: Two trade union activists, Kebal Raut and Hare Ram Yadav, were killed and more than 50 workers injured by police on 29 August in an incident which occurred after workers from various factories in the Bara District had joined workers from the Narayani Rolling Mills factory in their action against the company management.
The strike was called by the Nepal Independent Chemical and Iron Workers' Union (NICIWU), an affiliate of the General Federation of Nepalese Trade Unions (GEFONT), and was later joined by workers from other unions, including the Nepal Trade Union Congress-Independent (NTUC-I).
The workers had gone on strike to demand permanent jobs, payment of the minimum wage and the reinstatement of 21 dismissed workers.
The dispute was ended when a tripartite agreement was reached on the payment of 1 million rupees to the families of the two workers killed, free and effective medical treatment for those injured and the reinstatement of the 21 dismissed workers.
Police violence against demonstrators: On 3 September, during a peaceful protest in Kathmandu, the police arrested 80 trade union leaders, including Santosh Rajyamajhi, General Secretary of the United Telecom Ltd (UTL) workers' trade union.
The protest was in support of a union demand for an end to the system of temporary contracts for workers, for better working conditions and for the proper application of Nepal's labour and trade union laws.
Violence was used by the police during the arrest and many of the workers were injured, some by bullets.
The workers were detained at Mahendra police station and released in the evening.
GEFONT reports that workers employed by Navin Polimr industries in the Parsa district were beaten by police on 29 December.
Three of them sustained serious injuries.
The workers were taking part in a peaceful protest to demand that management apply an agreement and allow them to return to work (the factory doors had been padlocked by management since 25 November).
Negotiations between the trade union representatives, management and the police foresee the application of the agreement in question and stiff sanctions against the police officers responsible for the violence.
Inter-union rivalry and violence: The rivalry between Nepalese unions sometimes leads to clashes between workers from different organisations.
It seems this has grown since the union linked to the party of former Maoist guerrillas has gained in prominence.
GEFONT and its affiliates have reported several cases of attacks on its members by Maoist activists.
On 2 January, seven GEFONT leaders were injured in a brutal attack by members of the Maoist All Nepal Federation of Trade Union (ANFTU).
The leaders had come to talk to management at Pokhara Noodles Private Limited to ask for the reinstatement of 12 dismissed workers.
Similar cases occurred at Trvinevi Textiles Weaving Unit in Bara (eight workers seriously injured during a strike to demand the payment of their salaries on time) and at Himalayan Snacks and Noodles in Banepa.
2008 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Nicaragua
There has been a sharp increase in the number of unions, with the Ministry of Labour promoting trade unions.
There has been no reduction in freedom of association violations, however.
Companies in the export processing zones continue to be the principal violators of trade union rights.
There were major strikes by teachers, and several strikes were declared illegal.
Freedom of association: All public and private sector workers, with the exception of the armed forces and the police, may form trade unions and join the trade unions of their choice.
They are also free to create federations and confederations and to join international organisations.
At least 20 people are required to form a trade union; no prior authorisation is needed.
Once created, it must be entered in the Register of Trade Union Associations, thereby endowing it with legal status.
The members of the union's steering committee must be Nicaraguan.
Limited protection: Union leaders have protected status, but this is limited to nine executive members per union and three branch members.
The Labour Code allows enterprises to dismiss any employee, including union organisers, provided they have the permission of the Ministry of Labour (MITRAB) and pay double the usual severance pay.
Strikes and collective bargaining: The right to strike is recognised, albeit with some limitations.
To be considered officially approved, a strike must have the support of at least 50 per cent plus one of the total number of members of the trade union.
Votes on strikes are held at an extraordinary general meeting.
The trade union must receive the approval of the Ministry of Labour before engaging in strike action.
A mediation procedure involving the Ministry of Labour must first be exhausted.
If there is no agreement between the parties within 30 days of the strike being declared legal, the Ministry of Labour may intervene and end it.
Labour law allows sympathy strikes in support of another legal strike in the same industry or business.
The Regulation on Trade Union Associations (Reglamento de Asociaciones Sindicales) also limits the right to strike by federations and confederations.
In the event of a dispute, federations and confederations may only provide the workers in question with advice and moral or financial support.
Trade union rights in the export processing zones: (EPZs) Whilst stipulating the need to respect the Constitution and national laws, the Foreign Investment Law regulating the EPZs opens a loophole for avoiding their jurisdiction by providing for discrepancies, controversies and claims to be settled by an arbitration court.
Trade union rights in practice and Violations in 2007
Advances at the Ministry of Labour allow for increase in number of unions: During the year, the MITRAB demonstrated its political will to help increase the number of trade unions and eliminate the many obstacles to the registration of trade unions that used to exist within it, which had supported the anti-union policies of the employers.
From January the MITRAB agreed that it would no longer process letters from workers renouncing union membership, saying they had signed under pressure or were misled.
These letters had been one of the mechanisms used by employers to reduce the number of workers forming a union.
This avoided the objections that used to be raised by the Department for Trade Union Associations before a union was even founded.
The Ministry's decision has extended and protected trade union immunity from the moment an organisation is formed de facto, even before it is granted legal personality.
By the end of the year, there were more than 90 per cent more trade unions.
In 2006 there were 101 and now there are 200.
Employer strategies to destroy unions continue: Those companies that do have trade unions tirelessly seek ways of destroying them so that they can carry on imposing their policies at will.
Mass dismissals, including of the leaders or founder members of trade unions, are a key ploy for getting rid of unions or preventing the creation of new ones.
Another tactic is to offer workers incentives for leaving a union.
Employment relationships are changing through the imposition of short-term and even one-day contracts, which make it impossible to increase a union's membership.
Companies have also been making changes that may appear to be formalities but in fact affect union organising, such as changing their trade names as a legal way of de-legitimising the union or replacing members of management with anti-union "hardliners".
Export processing zones (EPZs): The worst violations occur in the export processing zones (EPZs), where the employers' hostility towards unions continues.
Very few of the unions in the zones have real collective bargaining power, despite the fact that the new Minister of Labour, Jeannette Chávez, warned the companies in the zones that they are obliged to respect workers' rights.
She announced there would be an inspection of companies that prevented the formation of trade unions.
On 11 May, the Minister of Labour declared the strike at the Nicaraguan Aqueduct and Sewer System Company (ENACAL) in the cities of Masaya, Rivas, Granada and in the Carazo department illegal and ordered that the strikers return to work within 48 hours.
The strike began on 10 May over the nonpayment of overtime, in contravention of the collective agreement.
On 9 August the employees of the Sajonia office of the Supreme Electoral Council (CSE), in Managua, ended their two-and-a-half-week strike after the MITRAB declared it illegal and urged the strikers to return to work within 48 hours.
The employees were calling for higher pay, fulfilment of the obligation to pay overtime and food allowances, and the payment of compensation to some 300 workers who were dismissed after the 2006 national elections.
A few days later the general secretary of the National Union of Independent Employees of the CSE (UNEICSE), Carolina Mena, reported that the CSE had made her take "forced leave" in retaliation for her union's strike and that the authorities had given the order to prevent her entering CSE premises.
Trade union members and leaders in the maquilas face threats and dismissals: The Nie Ching Garment maquila dismissed six trade union leaders affiliated to the Che Guevara Union, to avoid having the union in the company.
Although the company agreed to reinstate the workers, on 1 August the union leaders reported that they had received anonymous death threats, in which they were explicitly warned that they should leave the trade union movement, leading them to suspect that it was intimidation by the company's management.
By the end of the year, the SAE-A Tecnotex maquila had not complied with a 2006 ruling by the Ministry of Labour to reinstate six dismissed trade union leaders.
Textile companies close down and dismiss workers: On 5 September the Everly clothing factory closed and dismissed 400 workers.
It was claimed that the reason was low productivity, and that that was why the raw materials would be transferred to the Metro Garment company, owned by the same investors.
In reality, the closure was due to a 10,000 cordoba fine (540 dollars) imposed by the MITRAB because the factory had failed to pay overtime, as required by law.
KB Manufacturing closed down and has not yet paid the money it owes to 11 trade union leaders who took the company to court.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Nigeria
It was a violent year for Nigeria's trade unionists, as nurses were seriously injured during a peaceful protest.
Striking doctors were also attacked.
In an attack on the offices of the Maritime Workers' Union, four union officials were left critically injured.
A trade union leader in the Benue state was murdered, although the motive for his murder was unclear.
In addition, trade union rights are not adequately protected in the law.
Despite the repeal of some of the anti-labour decrees from the military era, many restrictions still remain.
To register a union, the organisation must represent at least 50 workers, and a union can not be registered where another union already exists.
Workers in essential services do not enjoy freedom of association, and organising in the country's export processing zones is virtually impossible.
Furthermore, the Registrar has broad powers to supervise the trade union accounts at any time.
The right to strike is likewise restricted, as the Trade Disputes Act imposes compulsory arbitration.
In addition, strikes that concern conflicts of interest or economic issues, including the government's social or economic policy, are prohibited.
Also, strikers may not block airports nor obstruct public highways, institutions or premises of any kind.
The penalties for participating in an illegal strike include fines and imprisonment for up to six months.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Collective bargaining and right to strike undermined: While the government and some employers may agree to collective bargaining, they generally fail to honour the agreements made, leading to many strikes.
In September 2009, lecturers from the Abeokuta University of Agriculture, in the Ogun State, took to the streets in protest at the government's continued refusal to sign an agreement it reached with the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) in 2001.
Police permission is required prior to a strike, but is rarely given.
The use of security forces to intimidate, harass and arrest strikers, often accompanied by the use of violence against trade unionists prior to or during strikes or protests, seriously undermines the right to strike.
When doctors at public hospitals in Lagos went on strike in May 2009 to protest over poor pay and working conditions, they were subjected to vicious attacks according to their spokesperson Ibrahim Olaifa.
At least one doctor was left in a critical condition after being physically attacked.
Anti-union attitudes in the oil industry: The National Union of Petroleum and National Gas workers (NUPENG) publicly denounced employment contracts in the oil and gas industry which failed to meet minimum labour standards and international best practices.
At a national delegates conference held at the end of 2009, the union noted that some multi-national oil and gas companies were awarding labour contracts designed ostensibly to de-unionise workers and create disaffection among trade unions.
It also protested at the effects on worker and their unions of casualisation in the industry.
Union leader murdered: The chairman of the Benue State branch of the Trade Union Congress (TUC), Tony Udu, was shot and killed at his home in Makurdi on 24 July.
A week later, the police arrested two of the gunmen, who are thought to be hired assassins.
The motive for the murder was not clear, but given the activism of the chairman, national TUC leaders believed it was political.
Thugs beat striking health workers: When a group of women health workers from the National Association of Nigeria Nurses and Midwives protested about the non-payment of their salaries for three months, they were seriously beaten by suspected political thugs.
On 17 December, the health workers, employed by the Abeokuta South council in the Ogun State, staged a peaceful protest outside the home of the local government chairman, Yanju Lipede.
They were a few metres from his house when two vehicles arrived and five large men disembarked.
They beat the women with horsewhips, sticks and other weapons.
Many of them had to be hospitalised because of their injuries, which included fractured bones.
According to one of the victims, Adeyola Solaja, a senior nurse, one of the vehicles used by the attackers had been traced to the local government's Supervisory Councillor on Health.
The right to strike is derived from Art.
9 par.
3 German Civil Code .
It is about a collective refusal of the employee to work.
The objective of the labour dispute is to enforce new claims to the employer in a collective agreement with regard to income , working time and working conditions.
The terms for a lawful strike are
The trade union responsible calls the strike
The employer is bound by the collective agreement.
That is the case if he/she is member of an employer association
The contract of employment must refer to the collective agreement so that it is valid.
For this reason, always read the contract of employment
A decision to strike by the main director of the board of the trade union is at hand.
First, a ballot vote is carried out among the trade union members.
A strike is called if at least 75% vote for it
The labour dispute is carried out fairly.
Counting among this are the set-up of emergency services guaranteeing transport to and from, the non-obstruction of strike-breakers and the consideration of economic issues – no strike up to bankruptcy
If these conditions do not pertain, then we are talking about warning strikes or short walk-outs (maybe even during wage negotiations), wild or independent strikes and secondary strikes or solidarity strikes.
A wild strike is at hand, if there is no trade union involved.
If members of another trade union support employees, then one speaks of a secondary strike.
This kind of strike is against the law.
The contract of employment is broken.
The employee can thus insist in the provision of performance, issue a warning and then terminate the contract and even claim for damages.
In the case of an illegal strike lasting more than 1 month, the membership of the health insured person expires.
As soon as the strike is organised by the trade union, then it usually a lawful strike.
Fundamentally, all employees can take part in a strike, not only trade union members.
Counting among these are apprentices and trainees .
Exclude are civil servants, supervisory board members or executive board members.
Civil servants are not allowed to be involved in areas of strike.
However, they can be called in to help the emergency services or overtime .
Nursing care insurance continues during the strike.
Annuity insurance also stays in effect; no contributions are made, however, during the strike.
For this reason, periods of insurance to be accredited are lacking unless voluntary contribution payments are made.
During the dispute, payment towards unemployment insurance is not made.
In the case of more than 4 weeks, these periods are not accredited to entitlement.
Accident protection by the legal accident protection is dropped during the period of strike especially for the journeys between home and work.
Christmas allowance , holiday pay and capital-forming benefits are dropped if the receipt of benefit falls in the month of strike.
Periods of striking also decrease the company pension .
Strikebreakers are those who do not participate in the dispute.
Some employers offer strikebreaker bonuses.
Nobody can be forced to break a strike.
Even temporary workers have the right to not co-operate.
The temporary employment agency must point this out.
In contrast to normal employees, the temporary worker continues to be paid in spite of the walkout.
The agency can, however, place him/her in another company where there is no strike.
Even one-euro jobbers cannot be forced to work in a company on strike.
Refusal to work does not lead to a shortening of unemployment benefit.
Trade union members in contrast to non-members are entitled to claim the payment of strike money from the trade union.
The membership fee that is paid to the trade union is usually 0.66 to 1% of their monthly gross income.
Pensioners, recipients of sick pay, the unemployed and employees in early retirement pay between 0.33% of the minimum fee and a maximum of 0.66% of their gross income.
The employer can react to the strike with lockouts.
Make sure it is a legal strike organised by the trade union.
Otherwise you run the risk of a warning, dismissal or a damage suit
Put your name on the strike list as a trade union member; you will then receive strike pay
2007 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Burma
The State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) military regime continued to totally disregard all human and labour rights.
Military agents tortured and imprisoned labour leaders, maintained bans on the Federation of Trade Unions – Burma (FTUB) and other labour organisations, and continued the house arrest of opposition leader and Nobel Peace prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi.
Despite interventions by the ILO, forced labour continued to be used systematically by the regime.
Burma's one-party Constitution, which dates back to 1974 but was suspended in 1988, provides for freedom of association, in theory.
In a communication to the ILO dated 23 September 2004, the SPDC claims that since the Constitution was suspended, it is not possible to legally establish a trade union in Burma that conforms to the requirements of ILO Convention no.
87. However, the SPDC has no difficulties in enforcing colonial and more recent legislation, as well as military decrees and orders (which take precedence over any other legal provision) that impose severe legal limitations on this right.
In particular, much of the British-era legislation has so far not been repealed, amended or officially abrogated.
This is the case with the 1926 Trade Union Act which has been the subject of comment by the ILO for many years.
One of the problems in the law is the excessively high threshold required to establish a trade union (50 per cent of workers must belong for the union to be legally recognised).
In 1964, the Law Defining the Fundamental Rights and Responsibilities of the People's Workers was adopted.
The 1926 Trade Union Act remained in force in so far as it was compatible with the 1964 Law.
For many years, the ILO has sought, without success, to obtain clarification from the government on the extent to which the 1964 Law had repealed the Trade Union Act.
Single trade union system: Moreover, the 1964 Law establishes a compulsory system for the organisation and representation of workers, which is contrary to ILO standards.
The 1964 Law was amended in 1976.
In its 1977 comments, the ILO noted, however, that the Law as amended still " ... imposes a single trade union system contrary to Article 2 of the Convention [No.
87], under which workers have the right to form organisations of their own choosing".
That situation remains unchanged.
Furthermore, on 30 September 1988, the military regime issued Order 6/88 known as the Law on the Formation of Associations and Organisations.
This Order states that all "organisations shall apply for permission to form to the Ministry of Home and Religious Affairs".
It also provides that "organisations that are not permitted shall not form or continue to exist and pursue activities.
" The definition of "organisation" in the Order, is extremely detailed and sweeping, and includes "an association, society, union, party, committee, federation, group of associations, front, club and similar organisation that is formed with a group of people for an objective or a programme either with or without a particular name.
" There is no doubt that Order 6/88 applies to workers' and employers' organisations, and means that they have to request previous authorisation from the military to be established or to pursue their activities.
This is a blatant violation of ILO Convention 87.
Penalties provided in the Order for punishing violations are particularly harsh and may entail imprisonment of up to five years.
Whatever the written law, in practice, workers who fight to redress often atrocious working conditions in turn face threats, violence and murder by the authorities who equate trade unionism with treasonous behaviour.
No trade unions allowed: All trade unions that existed before the present military regime came to power have been disbanded.
There is a complete lack of legally registered workers' organisations in Burma.
Any workers' organisation in Burma has to function underground and its members face constant threat of repression and reprisal, including detention, torture and criminal prosecution.
FTUB – independent workers' organisation forced to work underground: The independent Federation of Trade Unions-Burma (FTUB) has been forced to operate clandestinely since its inception in 1991.
It maintains structures both inside and outside the country.
It is the effective voice of over 1.5 million Burmese migrants working in Thailand.
But the FTUB also maintains underground unions in key industrial sectors in Burma proper, and operates in all the major cities of the country.
It actively collects evidence of violations of workers' rights and monitors the denial of collective bargaining rights in industrial sectors, as well as evidence of forced labour, which it communicates to the ILO and to the international labour movement.
FTUB members caught doing so are accused of treason and other offences, and have been sentenced to life imprisonment, and in some cases, incurred the death penalty.
The government's propaganda apparatus and diplomats regularly and virulently attack the FTUB, calling it an expatriate terrorist gang.
The (former) ICFTU itself has been accused of assisting and encouraging the FTUB to commit terrorist acts.
FTUB regularly accused of terrorism: The Secretary General of the FTUB, Maung Maung, had to leave the country at the time of the 1988 military crackdown, owing to his involvement in the democratic trade union movement.
He is under constant attack from the SPDC regime, which continually accuses him of leading a terrorist organisation, and being involved in bombings, planned assassinations, and other violent activities.
He was also accused by representatives of the Ministry of Labour of deceiving the ILO to take action against Burma, and has been prominently vilified at rallies organised throughout the country by government controlled civic organisations, like the USDA, the Myanmar Women's Affairs Federation, and the War Veterans' Organisation.
The SPDC and SECD have retaliated against seafarers who sought or accepted assistance from the SUB or the ITF.
The SUB reports that there are an increasing number of seafarers (numbering in the dozens) who contacted the SUB or the ITF while overseas (usually pursuant to a labour dispute on their ship) and whose status is now pending (in some cases for years) before the Department of Marine Administration or SECD.
Retaliation includes a range of punishments, including imprisonment, seizure of repatriated wages, suspension of licenses, and blacklisting so that the seafarer is unable to obtain another overseas seafarer position.
The SPDC and SECD also use the MOSA to deter seafarers from becoming involved with the SUB or ITF.
Continued detention of FTUB Central Executive Committee member Myo Aung Thant: Independent trade union leaders are punished with heavy prison sentences.
Previous issues of this Survey have reported in detail about the imprisonment and sentencing of FTUB CEC members U Myo Aung Thant and U Khin Kyaw, arrested in June 1997.
The former was sentenced to 20 years for "high treason", i.e.
maintaining contacts with the FTUB.
His wife was arrested at the same time and sentenced to ten years' imprisonment as an accomplice to her husband.
She was released in July 2002 and has since fled the country.
He is still detained at Myitkyina Prison in Kachin State, which has the coldest climate and is located in one of the most remote parts of the country.
According to his family, he has contracted tuberculosis while in prison and he suffers from very poor health.
Myanmar Hae Wae calls in police to defeat strike: On 2 May, the 934 workers at Hae Wae Garment, located in South Okkapala Township in Rangoon, went on strike to demand better conditions of work and increased salaries.
Factory owner Tae Joshin arrived to discuss their demands on the following day.
So did SPDC Township Authority Chairman Kyaw Shwe and local Police Chief Soe Lwin, who came with 20 police officers to "inspect" the factory and survey the situation.
When workers demanded a meeting with the Township Authority and police to press their demands, factory management refused – and only allowed a hand-picked group of 48 workers to meet with the authorities.
All of them were forced to sign a written statement that indicated that there were no problems at the factory.
Factory manager Myo Win later took the entire team of senior local township and police authorities to a nearby restaurant, where they received bribes from factory officials.
Workers were compelled to return to work without any improvement in conditions and faced a climate of intimidation in the factory in subsequent weeks.
A detachment of 12 to 20 police officers were regularly present in the factory to prevent further unrest.
FTUB senior official arrested in Thailand: On 1 December, Naing Ko Ko, the International Campaigns Secretary of the FTUB, was prevented by Thai authorities from entering Thailand after playing a high profile role as a senior Burmese activists in ASEAN civil society meetings held in the Philippines in advance of the annual meeting of ASEAN heads of state.
An investigation by the FTUB and other organisations found a strong likelihood that the Embassy of Burma in the Philippines may have been involved in requesting Thai action.
Naing Ko Ko's Burmese passport was declared null and void by the SPDC but timely interventions by the ITUC and other supportive organisations and individuals prevented the possible deportation of Naing Ko Ko to Burma.
After being held at the lock-up at the airport in Bangkok for three weeks, Naing Ko Ko was accepted as a refugee and resettled in a third country.
2009 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Nigeria
With one trade union leader assassinated and hundreds of activists and members threatened or dismissed, exercising trade union rights proved a formidable task throughout the year.
Nigerian legislation is not in line with Conventions 87 and 98, particularly in the EPZs.
Freedom of association: The Constitution recognises the right of workers to join or form trade unions but, despite the repeal of some of the anti-labour decrees from the military era, restrictions still remain.
At least 50 workers are needed to form a trade union.
There was no progress regarding the government's commitment to the ILO in 2006 to prepare – with with the ILO's assistance – a new draft Bill on Collective Labour Relations in conformity with C.87 and C.98.
Trade Union Amendment Act 2005: The Trade Union Amendment Act was passed in March 2005.
It retains the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) as a central labour union but gives other trade unions the freedom to federate and form umbrella unions, and makes union membership voluntary.
Previously, freedom of choice was restricted by the stipulation in the Trade Unions Act that no trade union could be registered to represent employees where a trade union already existed.
Right to strike undermined: The 2005 Act sets out strict conditions that trade unions and labour federations must meet before they can embark on a strike.
The law specifically prohibits trade unions or registered federations of trade unions from compelling anyone to strike, and stipulates that during strikes unions must not block airports nor obstruct public highways, institutions or premises of any kind.
Workers taking strike action which is deemed to be illegal are liable to both a fine and being imprisoned for up to six months.
These provisions make it extremely difficult to carry out a normal strike picket.
Unions must also give 15 days notice for a planned strike.
The Trade Disputes Act further limits the right to strike by imposing compulsory arbitration, with a penalty, a fine or six months' imprisonment for anyone failing to comply with the award issued by the National Industrial Court.
Export processing zones (EPZs) – anti-union decree: Article 4(e) of the 1992 Decree on Export Processing Zones states that "employer-employee" disputes are not matters to be handled by trade unions, but rather by the authorities managing these zones.
Article 13(1) of the same Decree makes it very difficult for workers to form or join trade unions, as it is almost impossible for worker representatives to gain free access to the EPZs.
Moreover, the Export Processing Zones Act prohibits strikes and lockouts for a period of 10 years after a company begins its activities in a given EPZ.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2008
Widespread refusal to engage with unions: Unions across the sectors complained of refusals to recognise labour organisations and to negotiate with them, interference by employers and/or the government in union affairs, and the use of threats and intimidation against workers' representatives.
The Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ) criticised the negative attitude of employers in the press towards the trade unions, making organising difficult.
Similarly, in the banking sector the Association of Senior Staff of Banks and Financial Institutions (ASSBIFI) complained of freedom of association violations in several of the banking companies recently created in the country.
ASSBIFI reported that in 11 of these companies, workers suspected of wanting to create or join a trade union were threatened with dismissal.
In an insurance company (Lasaco Assurance Plc.
), Olusola Fasanmi, President of the union affiliated to ASSBIFI, was suspended on 15 October for alleged embezzlement.
Following an internal inquiry, the union leader was totally exonerated, but he had to wait until 30 December before his employer allowed him to return to work.
The unions also criticised the increasingly systematic use of subcontracting firms and casual labour, making it all the more difficult to organise the workforce.
Little respect for the right to strike: While the government and some employers may agree to collective bargaining, they generally fail to honour the agreements made, leading to many strikes.
Police permission is required prior to a strike, but is rarely given.
The use of security forces to intimidate, harass and arrest strikers, often accompanied by the use of violence against trade unionists prior to or during strikes or protests, seriously undermines the right to strike.
Death of a transport union leader: On 6 January, Alhaji Saula Saka, President of the Lagos State branch of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), was murdered in his home by four armed men.
The killers fired several shots at the union leader before shooting in all directions to prevent anyone intervening.
The killing was believed to be linked to Alhaji Saula Saka's trade union activities.
Trade union leader dismissed from Lagos airport: At the end of June, management at Airlines Services Limited (ASL), a company providing catering services for several local and international airlines, dismissed James Ogu, the vice-president of the ASL union, affiliated to the National Union of Hotel and Personnel Services Workers (NUHPSW), over food portions.
According to the NUHPSW, the dismissal was in retaliation for union complaints that led to the dismissal of an expatriate employee.
Anti-unionism at Mobil Oil: At the beginning of March, Mobil Oil, a subsidiary of ExxonMobil, dismissed 100 leaders and members of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria).
The decision came a few days after management at Mobil Oil refused to take part in a national tripartite mediation meeting that three other companies had been invited to, and had participated in.
At the beginning of the year PENGASSAN had criticised the lack of progress in implementing agreements – albeit fairly limited in scope – signed with these companies in 2007.
According to PENGASSAN, Mobil Oil has emerged in the last few years as the worst oil company operating in the Niger Delta in terms of respecting workers' and trade union rights.
At the end of March, PENGASSAN cancelled a planned strike after Mobil Oil agreed to reinstate the 100 dismissed workers.
At a more general level, PENGASSAN and the National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) have repeatedly complained of the hostility the oil companies have shown towards the unions, particularly in restructuring operations, when union activists have often been the first victims of mass dismissals.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Oman
Trade unions are still rare.
Migrants' working conditions remain a cause for concern.
Only one trade union federation is allowed, and the right to strike is recognised, though with restrictions.
Despite recent improvements to trade union rights, problematic areas remain in the law.
Two decrees adopted in 2006 and 2007 grant workers the right to form trade unions, when previously only "representation committees" were allowed.
More than one union can now operate per company, and employers are prohibited from punishing or dismissing workers for union activities.
However, the reference to the "General Federation of the Sultanate of Oman" implies a monopoly with a single trade union federation.
The Ministry of Employment may also refuse to register a union "if it is not convinced" that all the requirements have been met.
Furthermore, there must be at least 25 employees for a union to be formed, regardless of the size of the company, and security and government personnel are not allowed to organise.
Trade union activities are restricted by the requirement that unions notify the government at least one month in advance of union meetings.
While wages and working conditions were previously set by law or individual contracts, workers are now allowed to carry out collective bargaining.
Still, the procedures for calling a lawful strike are cumbersome, as a strike must be supported by an absolute majority of the workforce, and notice of the strike must be given to the employer at least three weeks in advance.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Still no national trade union centre: The founding congress of the General Federation of the Sultanate of Oman, the country's only national trade union centre, has been postponed several times.
It is due to be held, finally, in February 2010.
At the end of 2008, the Ministry of Manpower had recorded 58 unions at the enterprise level.
Suicides among migrant workers on the increase: A United Arab Emirates newspaper, The National Newspaper, reported an increase in suicides among migrant workers in Oman.
Part of the reason for this is the very difficult living and working conditions they face.
2009 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Oman
The government allows trade unions, but only for certain categories of workers.
Only one trade union federation is authorised.
Collective bargaining and strikes are recognised, though with restrictions.
Some migrant workers reportedly work in conditions similar to forced labour.
Freedom of association: Two decrees adopted in 2006 and 2007 grant workers the right to form trade unions, when previously only "representation committees" were allowed.
More than one union can now operate per company, and employers are banned from punishing or dismissing workers for union activities.
The armed forces, security and government personnel, and domestic workers are not allowed to form unions.
There must be at least 25 employees for a union to be formed, regardless of the size of the company.
The Decree's reference to the "General Federation of the Sultanate of Oman" implies a monopoly with a single trade union federation.
The Ministry of Employment may refuse to register a trade union "if it is not convinced" that all the requirements have been met.
Unions must notify the government at least one month in advance of union meetings.
Collective bargaining: Workers are allowed to carry out collective bargaining, replacing the formal requirement that wages and working conditions had to be set by law or individual contracts.
When there is no trade union, collective bargaining will take place between the employer and five representatives selected by the workers of the enterprise.
The employer is not allowed to object to any of the representatives selected.
While negotiation is ongoing, the employer is prohibited to take any decision on issues that are on the bargaining table.
Right to strike: Peaceful strike action is allowed.
Strikes must be supported by an absolute majority of the workforce.
Notice of the strike must be received by the employer in writing at least three weeks beforehand.
The strike should come to an end if the parties agree to commence the procedures for settling the dispute.
To this end, the Ministry will form a committee in consultation with workers and the employer.
If such committee fails to solve the dispute within four weeks, the dispute will be referred to the courts.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2008
Freedom of association: The Constitutive Congress of the General Federation of the Sultanate of Oman, the country's only trade union centre, which was scheduled to take place in September or October after being delayed on several occasions, failed to take place.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Panama
A leader of the national construction workers' union, Sindicato Único Nacional de trabajadores de la Industria de la Construcción y Similares (SUNTRACS), was murdered against a background of serious and widespread labour rights violations in Panama.
Public sector employees only have the right to form associations, and the right to strike is restricted.
There are a number of concerns despite basic trade union rights being recognised.
Freedom of association is guaranteed in law.
However, public sector workers do not have the right to form unions but only "associations", and the minimum membership requirements for creating both associations and unions are excessive.
There can only be one association per institution, and only one branch per province.
While trade union protection is guaranteed to union leaders, it is only extended to 11 union members.
Furthermore, both private and public sector workers may engage in collective bargaining, but new enterprises are not compelled to conclude collective agreements during the first two years of operation.
The right to strike is recognised in the Constitution, but a strike must be agreed upon by an absolute majority of the workers in an enterprise.
Strikes can only be organised in relation to certain specific issues, and federations, confederations and national centres may not call a strike.
The right to strike is also weakened by binding arbitration and conciliation processes, as well as by the fact that the government can requisition at least 50% of employees in essential services, the list of which exceeds the ILO definition.
Finally, strikes are prohibited for employees governed by the Panama Canal Authority, in EPZs and in new enterprises.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Employers promote yellow unions to block collective bargaining: Companies continue to encourage the forming of yellow unions alongside existing unions with which they have already signed collective agreements, as a way of neutralising bona fide trade unions and negotiating inferior working conditions, gradually undermining and eliminating workers' rights.
Another strategy to avoid complying with collective agreements is to dismiss unionised workers and hire foreign workers under inferior terms and conditions.
Restrictions on public workers' organising rights: Violations of core labour standards include restrictions on the right to unionise, collective bargaining and the right to strike in the public sector.
Mass dismissals: In April, 70 workers employed by the Ports Outsourcing Service and the Panama Ports Company, a subsidiary of the multinational Hutchison Whampoa Limited, suffered persecution and dismissals after forming unions at the two companies with the backing of the national trade union centre, Central General Autónoma de Trabajadores de Panamá (CGTP).
Persecution and murders: In December, construction workers brought a case against the Panamanian state before the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.
The workers are accusing the authorities of persecution and assassinations, as well as denying them the right to form unions.
The measure is backed by the national trade union confederation, Confederación Nacional de Unidad Sindical (CONUSI), the national construction workers' union, Sindicato Único Nacional de Trabajadores de la Industria de la Construcción y Similares (SUNTRACS), and the national front for the defence of social security, Frente Nacional en Defensa de la Seguridad Social (FRENADESSO).
2007 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Panama
Economic incentives to companies and the deregulation and increasing flexibility of employment relationships remain barriers to organising trade unions in Panama.
Existing unions and associations faced reprisals, threats and de-recognition campaigns when demanding their rights or getting involved in major national policy decisions.
Protections but limitations on organising: Private sector workers have the right to form and join unions of their choice.
The Ministry of Labour is legally bound to promote the creation of trade unions where they do not exist.
Trade union protection is guaranteed to leaders of unions, including those still being formed.
There are limitations, however.
Only a single trade union is authorised per establishment.
Trade unions may only open one branch office per province and a minimum of 40 members are required to set up a branch union, a number excessive by international standards.
All members of a trade union executive must be Panamanian.
Trade union protection only covers 11 union members.
The right to strike: For a strike to be legal, an absolute majority of workers in the enterprise concerned must vote in favour.
Strikes can only be called to demand an improvement in working conditions, in relation to a collective agreement or in protest at the repeated violation of legal rights.
Strikes cannot be called to protest about government policy, to demand an increase in the minimum wage or to demand union recognition.
Federations, confederations and national centres may not call a strike.
A 1996 decree weakened the right to strike by imposing a binding arbitration and conciliation process, establishing a long list of posts in which strikes are banned and giving the Labour Ministry discretion to extend that list.
Trade union rights in the public sector: Public sector workers do not have the right to form unions.
Based on the 1994 Civil Service Act, civil servants may form "associations" and engage in collective bargaining, but only if they have a minimum of 50 members, and they can only form one association per institution.
The association can in turn form federations and engage in collective bargaining.
Special restrictions: The law governing the autonomous Panama Canal Authority prohibits the right to strike for its employees, but does allow unions to organise and bargain collectively.
In the maquiladoras, all labour disputes are subject to compulsory arbitration.
A strike is only considered legal after 36 working days of conciliation are exhausted.
If this requirement is not met, striking workers may be fined or dismissed.
The law governing Export Processing Zones (EPZs) also applies to call centres.
Scant protection in the public sector: The Civil Service Act provides little protection, given that in practice only about 10,000 people have civil servant status.
The remaining 140,000 public sector workers are, in effect, denied the right to form trade unions.
Deregulation of contracts and freedom to dismiss workers is affecting the right to organise: The deregulation of employment contracts and the flexibility that is spreading in practice has made it more difficult to form trade unions.
A 1992 labour law excluded one category of workers from the right to a permanent contract during their first three years of employment.
It also denied them the right to form and join trade unions.
The 1986 and 1995 reforms to the Labour Code grant companies the freedom to dismiss staff for economic reasons and limit the maximum compensation for unfair dismissal to three months' wages.
That deregulation indirectly affects the right to organise, since it is common knowledge that the fact of joining a trade union often turns out to be the real reason behind a dismissal, whether or not it is acknowledged as such, and since there is no requirement to justify such decisions there is no legal impediment to companies deploying an anti-union strategy.
At the same time, the right to engage in collective bargaining was limited through the imposition of individual arrangements, thereby consolidating the unequal relationship between workers and their employers.
That explains why various sectors including trade, which is one of the key economic sectors in the country, have no trade unions.
Bypassing the unions: Employers are allowed to draw up collective agreements with non-organised groups of workers, because of the interpretation of the law by the administrative authorities and the courts.
This happens, say the unions, even where a union exists, and even where a collective agreement already exists.
Often companies themselves encourage the forming of parallel trade unions as a way of neutralising the existing union and negotiating collective agreements that suit them better.
The administrative procedures which must be followed before a strike can take place are used to declare strikes illegal.
A list of demands may, for example, be considered unacceptable if it involves changes to an existing collective agreement.
A 1998 decree concerning workers at sea and on navigable waterways makes collective agreements optional, rather than obligatory, as is the case for other workers under the Labour Code.
The national trade union confederations claim that this loophole is being used to deny workers in the sector the right to bargain collectively or strike in order to demand a collective agreement.
Labour Ministry failing in its task of promoting trade unions: The Ministry of Labour has made no attempt to encourage trade union organising, despite the stipulation to that effect in the law.
On the contrary it has failed to react when confronted with violations of the right to organise.
As a result it has tacitly contributed to the messages conveyed in the media, most of which support the anti-union policy of managers.
EPZs: There are no collective agreements in the export processing zones.
Background: On 22 October a national referendum was held as a basis for deciding whether or not to accept the Panama Canal Extension Project.
Many trade union organisations, together with most of the country's labour and people's movements, made the campaign against the extension a priority in 2006.
The whole process, which resulted in a vote in favour of the extension, was fraught with disputes, threats and campaigns aimed at denigrating the most militant labour leaders involved in the struggle.
In September four union leaders were arrested whilst circulating flyers supporting the campaign to vote "No" in the referendum.
No reinstatement for sacked trade unionists: In 2006, the civil servants' association FENASEP ("Federación Nacional de Asociaciones de Servidores Públicos") repeated its complaints to the ILO against the State of Panama for failing to reinstate the trade union leaders dismissed under the previous administration.
The Federation deplores the fact that the government has ignored the ILO's recommendations on this case.
Thirty union leaders have still not been reinstated, whilst those working in other state institutions have not been given any back pay for the wages they lost following their dismissal.
Reprisals for demanding rights: The Valores company, a Panamanian subsidiary of Group 4 Securicor, sacked 40 employees on 17 October who had taken part in a protest organised by the Union of Security Agency Workers ("Unión de Trabajadores de Agencias de Seguridad").
The union was calling for better working conditions, wage increases, payment of overtime and improved health and safety conditions.
By the end of the year the workers had not been reinstated so the union maintained a permanent vigil outside the company offices for over two months.
Anti-union campaign by the media: The construction and allied workers' union SUNTRACS ("Sindicato Único Nacional de Trabajadores de la Industria de la Construcción y Similares") criticised what it regarded as various attempts by the media to denigrate trade unions, with connivance from the government and employers.
2008 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Panama
Trade union persecution increased during the year.
A wave of repression ended in the assassination of two members of the SUNTRACS union.
Several demonstrations were repressed, union leaders were wounded and others were arrested.
Construction companies developed new strategies to avoid complying with their collective agreement.
Protection of and limitations on organising: Private sector workers have the right to form and join unions of their choice.
The Ministry of Labour is legally bound to promote the creation of trade unions where they do not exist.
Trade union protection is guaranteed to leaders of unions, including those still being formed.
There are limitations, however.
Only a single trade union is authorised per establishment.
Trade unions may only open one branch office per province and a minimum of 40 members are required to set up a branch union, a number excessive by international standards.
All members of a trade union executive must be Panamanian.
Trade union protection only covers 11 union members.
The right to strike: For a strike to be legal, an absolute majority of workers in the enterprise concerned must vote in favour.
Strikes can only be called to demand an improvement in working conditions, in relation to a collective agreement or in protest at the repeated violation of legal rights.
Strikes cannot be called to protest about government policy, to demand an increase in the minimum wage or to demand union recognition.
Federations, confederations and national centres may not call a strike.
A 1996 decree weakened the right to strike by imposing a binding arbitration and conciliation process, establishing a long list of posts in which strikes are banned and giving the Labour Ministry discretion to extend that list.
Trade union rights in the public sector: Public sector workers do not have the right to form unions.
Based on the 1994 Civil Service Act, civil servants may form "associations" and engage in collective bargaining, but only if they have a minimum of 50 members, and they can only form one association per institution.
The association can in turn form federations and engage in collective bargaining.
Special restrictions: The law governing the autonomous Panama Canal Authority prohibits the right to strike for its employees but does allow unions to organise and bargain collectively on specific matters such as working hours and safety conditions.
In the maquiladoras, all labour disputes are subject to compulsory arbitration.
A strike is only considered legal after 36 working days of conciliation are exhausted.
If this requirement is not met, striking workers may be fined or dismissed.
The law governing Export Processing Zones (EPZs) also applies to call centres.
Trade union rights in practice and Violations in 2007
Background: The year began with the signing and ratification of the Free Trade Agreement with the United States.
It has not come into force, however, because it is still awaiting ratification by the US Congress, despite the intense lobbying of the Martín Torrijos administration.
The high cost of living, deterioration in working conditions, and projects concerning mines, dams and hydroelectric plants were the principal causes of conflict between the labour movement and the government.
Labour flexibility limiting the right to organise: The deregulation of employment contracts and increased labour flexibility in practice continue to be the principal obstacles to the creation and functioning of trade unions.
Yellow unions opposed to collective agreements: As a way of neutralising the more active unions and negotiating working conditions that fall below existing ones, companies themselves encourage the forming of trade unions in parallel with existing unions with whom they have signed collective agreements, thus gradually deteriorating and eliminating workers' rights.
Another strategy to avoid complying with collective agreements is to dismiss unionised workers and hire foreign workers under inferior conditions.
Labour Ministry complicit through its silence: The Ministry of Labour has made no attempt to encourage trade union organising, despite the stipulation to that effect in the law.
On the contrary, it has failed to react when confronted with violations of the right to organise and ignores complaints and warnings from unions, while accepting and legitimising yellow and employer-sponsored unions.
This has led to the unions accusing the Ministry of being responsible for the deaths of trade union leaders in the construction industry.
EPZs: There are still no collective agreements in the export processing zones.
Yellow unions created to dismantle the SUNTRACS-CAPAC collective agreement: The construction workers' union SUNTRACS has a collective agreement with the chamber of employers ("Cámara Panameña de la Construcción", CAPAC) that protects all the employees of the signatory companies, whether or not they are union members.
In some companies such as Constructora Maqtec S.A., Constructora Norberto Odebrecht S.A. and the Corcione group, the employers promoted the creation of trade unions in order to sign collective agreements with them with conditions inferior to those contained in the SUNTRACS agreement.
The companies concerned demand that the workers join the employer-sponsored union when they sign their employment contract.
One day later on 14 August on the Panama-Colon motorway project, in the middle of demonstrations to ask for better occupational safety standards, a hired gunman shot and killed Osvaldo Lorenzo Pérez, the SUNTRACS union representative for the REC company.
The trade unionists denounced the killer's links to the Brazilian company Norberto Odebrecht, which had hired him to suppress the protest.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Pakistan
Although the new Industrial Relations Act adopted in 2008 represents some progress, it remains partially at odds with international standards.
Many workers enjoy limited trade union rights, and the right to strike is circumscribed by excessive restrictions.
In practice, trade union rights are often violated.
Several trade union activists were arrested, detained or discriminated against during the year.
Private employers often refuse to recognise unions and commonly use union-busting tactics.
Despite the improvements brought by the interim 2008 Industrial Relations Act, many problematic areas exist in the labour law.
While the Constitution guarantees freedom of association, it is denied to workers in many sectors.
Then union activities are hampered by the requirement that any gathering of more than four people is subject to police authorisation.
The Registrar also retains wide powers to inspect the accounts and records of registered trade unions.
Finally, the federal government also has wide powers to prohibit any strike if it lasts for more than 30 days causing "serious hardship to the community" or is "prejudicial to the national interests".
In the case of public utility services, strikes may be prohibited at any time before or after the start of the strike.
The procedures for calling a lawful strike last at least one month, and illegal strikes, as well as go-slows and picketing, carry penalties of long imprisonments as well as fines.
Workers in export processing zones are denied the right to strike.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
In addition, Pakistan has been hit hard by the economic crisis and unions are calling for an urgent increase in the minimum wage to cope with rising prices and harsh IMF repayment terms.
Contract workers and rural workers face particularly bad working conditions and minimum access to labour rights.
Poverty has continued to rise.
The economic crisis has also led to a reported rise in child labour.
Weak labour law enforcement by local governments: The Factories Act of 1934 provides for inspection of enterprises, but this authority has been increasingly devolved to provincial and lower level governments with the net result that labour inspections are hardly ever performed, and that employers are able to violate key provisions of the law on wages and conditions of work with impunity.
Anti-union discrimination in banks: In recent years, hundreds of trade union leaders have been dismissed under the terms of the Banking Companies (Amendment) Act, 1997.
In 2009 in an effort to lift the restrictions on trade union activities in banks, Deputy Secretary General of the Pakistan Peoples Party filed a private members bill against the legislation.
In addition, the Pakistan Workers' Federation has reported reprisals against trade unionists by the National Bank of Pakistan while in November 2009, Imran Usman, a member of the Muslim Commercial Bank Staff Union, was reportedly abducted for his union activities.
Appalling working conditions for contract workers – unionist supporter arrested: In February, the Pakistan Central Mines Labour Federation (PCMLF), an affiliate of the Labour Confederation of Pakistan, staged a protest demonstration in Quetta to protest a mineshaft collapse at the Mach coal mine in which eight mineworkers died.
In addition, the names of the contract staff working in the mine had not been registered, including the victims.
This is common practice and presents yet another obstacle to organising the sector.
The General Secretary of the Pakistan Workers Federation in the region, Haji Muhammad Ramzan Achakzai, was also detained on criminal charges for supporting the mineworkers as well as later being involved in the cases of 250 dismissed Merck employees in Quetta (see Violations 2009: Brutal repression of workers and unionists at the Merck Factory in Quetta).
Night time raids to arrest scores of unionists: In May, in various cities in Punjab Province, including Lahore, 34 union activists and labour leaders were arrested in late night raids.
Police also filed cases against 1,300 workers for their involvement in union activities in an alleged attempt by local businessmen to prevent the formation of trade unions.
According to the Labour Party Pakistan (LPP) and the National Trade Union Federation Pakistan (NTUFP), 30 belonged to the Labour Qaumi Movement (LQM), an organisation of textile workers, and were arrested on fake charges of attempted murder and kidnapping.
The four others arrested in Lahore included Niaz Khan, general secretary of Ittehad Labour Union Carpet Industries Pakistan and leader of the National Trade Union Federation, who was arrested on allegedly false charges of robbery probably brought by the owner of Interwood.
Brutal repression of workers and unionists at the Merck Factory in Quetta: Workers at the German MNC Merck Marker Quetta factory complained of low wages, especially for contract workers who make up almost two-thirds of the staff.
Management responded with threats of factory closure and direct threats of dismissal.
After the sacking of 24 employees in June, workers formed a factory action committee and stopped overtime work.
Despite negotiations between union representatives and the provincial authorities, the factory went ahead with the threatened dismissal of at least 252 contract works on 10 July.
A police complaint against eight union office holders was issued by the company while the secretary general of the Merck Employees' Union, Manzoor Baloch, was arrested and charged with target killings, disturbing law and order and terrorism.
He was released after one month's detention.
After more protests, local government forces attacked and detained 120 Merck workers on criminal charges.
The General Secretary of the Pakistan Workers Federation in the region, Haji Muhammad Ramzan Achakzai, was also detained on criminal charges for supporting the Merck workers and the mineworkers in Quetta (see Appalling working conditions for contract workers – unionist supporter arrested).
Two union organisers arrested: Two members of the Pakistan Trade Union Defence Campaign (PTUDC) were detained on 22 June while distributing leaflets outside the Karachi Pakistan Steel plant.
They were released two days later.
Oil workers dismissed and beaten for complaining: In July, 29 workers at the Pak Arab Oil Refinery (PARCO) were dismissed summarily after over 18 years service in Punjab.
The workers went to the local Multan Labour Court to complain at the unfair dismissal.
The court decided in favour of these workers and ordered the company management to reinstate the workers.
However, the order was not carried out.
Instead, when the workers went to the factory with their court orders, they were threatened and beaten by security staff.
Previously, the factory had employed 22 permanent workers – union members covered by a collective agreement – while another 723 workers had been hired through six contract labour agencies.
The contract workers organised an action committee, and the Unilever Mazdoor Union Khanewal supported by the National Federation of Food, Beverage and Tobacco Workers of Pakistan helped them file petitions to obtain permanent employment, union membership and better conditions.
Unilever responded by denying work, threatening and demoting those who joined the action committee while hiring new contract labour.
2008 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Pakistan
Pakistan's highly restrictive labour laws, combined with a near total lack of law enforcement bodies, permitted unmitigated attacks by employers and state enterprises managers against trade union rights.
Despite longstanding promises to the ILO, the government made no progress in amending its laws to bring them into compliance with international standards and continued to exclude workers in many economic sectors from exercising their rights.
The Sindh provincial government outlawed the teachers' unions, and several state enterprises and military-controlled companies continued to bar unions.
Significant restrictions on union registration: There is a legislative barrier to registration owing to the wide powers given to the Registrar of Trade Unions, who can refuse or cancel a union's registration.
In particular, the IRO 2002 appears to disallow the registration of occupational or sectoral trade unions by providing that only unions of workers engaged in the same establishment or industrial undertaking may be registered (Article 6(2)a).
The powers of the registrar to cancel trade union registration under Article 12 (3) are contrary to the principles of freedom of association, which provide that cancellation of union registration should only be possible through judicial channels.
Interference with union activities: The IRO gives the Registrar wide powers to investigate and audit union accounts as "deemed fit", and there are broad powers for the labour court to exclude or disqualify a union office bearer from holding further office, not all of which are related to the capacity of the individual to hold a trade union office.
IRO fails to protect workers: Section 46(5) in the IRO 2002 sets out that the Labour Court may order an award of compensation (12 to 30 months' wages) in case of wrongful termination in lieu of reinstatement of the worker.
This enables employers to sack "troublesome" workers, such as trade union representatives, with impunity.
The IRO also restricts the possibility of seeking interim relief from the National Industrial Relations Commission (NIRC) or the Labour Court against unfair labour practices.
Furthermore, the penalties imposed on trade union representatives found guilty of unfair labour practices are comparatively heavier than those imposed on employers.
Reform of labour laws – workers still waiting: During the year, the government again failed to change the IRO in line with international labour standards despite promises to the ILO.
Nor has it made any progress in consolidating the over 60 laws covering labour issues into six core laws beyond the IRO promulgated in 2002.
However, without adequate prior consultation with the trade unions, the government did make unilateral changes to five different labour laws, effectively increasing hours of work and further weakening labour protection.
The amendments were made using the finance law in a procedure that unionists called legally dubious.
A separate classification of "contract workers" who are not eligible for overtime pay raised significant concerns among unionists that employers may accelerate the re-classification of permanent workers (with full union rights) to more vulnerable "contract workers".
Strike limitations: There are many legal obstacles to the right to strike.
For example, it takes at least one month before a strike can be legally declared.
The period for bilateral dialogue between management and the union is 15 days.
Where settlement is not reached, the conciliation procedure also lasts 15 days.
Cooling off periods also must be observed before a legal strike can be held.
The IRO does not provide any clarity regarding the right to strike in search of problems posed by major social and economic policy trends and whether workers may conduct sympathy strikes without penalty.
Limited rights in public sector: The Civil Servants Act, 1973, sets the terms and conditions of employment for this category of public sector workers.
These employees may not engage in collective bargaining.
Their organisations do not have the right to be fully independent and merely exist as associations, not trade unions.
The Act does not allow civil servants to form and join trade unions, to draw up their constitutions and rules or to organise their administration, activities and programmes without previous authorisation.
No freedom of association for airline or electricity workers: In various state enterprises, the government and military continually demonstrated an anti-union bias by either banning trade unions outright or petitioning to revoke the union registrations.
Trade union rights have been suspended at Pakistan International Airlines Corporation and at the Karachi Electric Supply Corporation (KESC).
The Pakistan National Shipping Corporate, Army Welfare Sugar Mills and the Karachi Shipyard and Engineering Works were the latest examples of the government's action against unions (see section on Violations).
Restrictions in banking sector: Amendments to the Banking Companies Ordinance in 1997 state that a worker cannot become a union member or official in a banking institution unless he or she is employed by the bank in question, thereby restricting the right of union members to choose who will represent them.
They also stipulate that no officer or member of a trade union in a banking institution shall use any bank facilities, including a car or telephone, to promote trade union activities.
Similarly, trade union activities are restricted in office hours.
Any person violating such provisions shall be liable to a fine or imprisonment of up to three years, or both.
Restrictions have also been imposed on the collective bargaining rights of banking staff.
The ESMA prohibits workers in EPZs – who could otherwise have come under the IRO – from forming or joining unions, bargaining collectively or striking.
They have no protection against employer interference or anti-union discrimination.
The Export Processing Zones Act of 1980 also provides for notifications to exempt the zones from coverage under the major labour laws.
The government reported in 2002 that it had authorised the EPZA to frame draft legislation and that draft labour laws were being finalised by the authority.
However, no further details have been forthcoming.
However, the EPZA advertises on its website that one of the incentives for investors is "production-oriented labour laws to be solely regulated by the Authority".
Code of Criminal Procedure: Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure makes any gathering of more than four people subject to police authorisation.
Hence it can easily be used against any trade union gathering.
Trade union rights in practice and Violations in 2007
However, there was some hope for workers in June 2005 when the NIRC overturned a government notification of April 2004, through which over 700 members of the House Building Finance Corporation Workers' Union were restrained from carrying out trade union activities after being promoted to assistant managers.
The council found that the nature of their job had not changed, and they were therefore deemed to be workmen.
Weak labour law enforcement by state governments: The Factories Act of 1934 provides for inspection of enterprises, but this authority has been increasingly assumed by state governments.
Unionists report that the net result has been that labour inspections are hardly ever performed, and the employers are therefore able to violate key provisions of the law on wages and conditions of work with impunity.
Anti-union discrimination in banks: According to United Bank Employees' Federation, union members have been ruthlessly victimised by the management of banks, particularly in United Bank Limited (UBL).
In recent years, hundreds of trade union leaders have been dismissed under the terms of the Banking Companies (Amendment) Act, 1997, in what the Federation believes is an attempt to undermine the very existence of the United Bank Employees' Federation.
The government has not acted on the ILO's request that it amend the Act.
Women: Rubina Jameel, president of the Working Women's Organisation (WWO), reported in 2004 that women trade union activists face accusations of "bringing dishonour" on their families if they try to organise women workers.
Ms Jameel herself has been criticised by religious groups for "corrupting women" and being "against Islam" because of her work.
Liaquat Ali Sahi, trade union leader at the State Bank of Pakistan and the organiser of the Karachi Pearl Continental Hotel Workers' Solidarity Committee; Ghulam Fareed Awan, assistant general secretary of the All Pakistan Trade Union Federation (APTUF)-Sind Province; and Ayub Qureshi, member of Pakistan Trade Union Federation (PTUF) were among those arrested on 5 November during a protest demonstration against the declaration of a state of emergency.
Members of the Pakistani Federation of Chemical, Energy, Mine and General Workers' Union were also arrested.
Liaquat Ali Sahi and four others were charged with treason, an offence that carries the death penalty.
Liaquat Ali Sahi, Ghulam Fareed Awan and Ayub Qureshi were released on bail on 23 November after 18 days in detention.
Progress at Coca-Cola: After months of anti-unionism, tough local negotiations (see the 2006 Annual Survey) supported by an international IUF campaign led to the IUF's affiliate representing Coca-Cola workers in Pakistan securing significant written guarantees on union recognition and job security.
An agreement signed on February 22 in Karachi guarantees the company has to recognise and consult with the union in future when issues affecting jobs arise.
It also ensures that in future any permanent workers whose position becomes vacant will be replaced by other permanent workers.
Both represent major achievements by the union in a country where such rights are rarely secured or respected.
Court forces Nestlé to recognise trade union election results: On 28 July the Punjab Labour Court ruled in favour of the Employees Union at Nestlé Milkpak, a member of the IUF-affiliated National Federation of Food, Beverage and Tobacco Workers, reaffirming the right to free union elections.
The decision brought to an end months of intimidation and harassment by Nestlé management, which had attempted to force the democratically elected union president, Mohammad Hussein Bhatti, to resign.
On 28 July the Punjab Labour Court rejected the management's petition.
The Court also directed the registrar of trade unions in Punjab to validate the election of Mr. Bhatti and all the office bearers in his team.
Banning trade unions at the behest of the Pakistan military: The Registrar of Trade Unions of Sindh banned the trade union at Karachi Shipyard and Engineering Works (KSEW) on 26 August 2006, stripping 3,000 workers of their right to freedom of association.
The ban effectively short-circuited union bargaining efforts with KSEW management over a number of pending union demands.
The unions took the case to the Sindh High Court, challenging the legality of the ban.
The Court had not delivered its verdict by the end of the year.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Paraguay
Social dialogue has been strengthened under the government of President Lugo.
Rights violations and anti-union practices remain commonplace, however, both in the private and public sectors, as seen at Frigorífico Neuland Ltda and in the civil aviation industry.
The labour legislation does not promote trade union activities.
Despite initial guarantees, a number of restrictions apply to trade union rights.
The Constitution allows both private and public sector workers to form and join unions.
However, the procedures for registering a union are cumbersome, and an inordinate 300 workers are needed to form an industrial union.
Employers can also file a writ opposing the registration of a union.
Furthermore, members of a union must belong to the respective occupation, and candidates for trade union office must work in the company and be active members of the union.
Workers may not be members of more than one union either.
Union activities are also restricted by the requirement that trade unions comply with all requests for consultations or reports from the labour authorities.
While the law protects workers against anti-union discrimination, there are few genuinely dissuasive sanctions and the labour courts are not obliged to order the reinstatement of unfairly dismissed trade unionists.
Finally, the right to strike is guaranteed in law, but all strikes must be directly and exclusively linked to the workers' occupational interests.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Background: President Fernando Lugo of the Patriotic Alliance for Change came to power at the end of 2008, ending the 61 year rule of the Colorado Party.
During 2009, Lugo was faced with a country in need of urgent policies to combat poverty, to fight corruption within the public administration, to stimulate productivity and address the needs in the areas of health, education, housing and social security, as well as to ensure the application of trade union rights and freedoms.
The national workers' confederation, Confederación Nacional de Trabajadores (CNT), and other representatives of the Paraguayan trade union movement welcomed many of the measures adopted by the government and urged it to ensure compliance with human rights, labour laws and ILO Conventions.
Serious trade union rights violations at Cooperativa Frigorífico Neuland Ltda: On 18 March, the police of Villa Hayes, capital of the Presidente Hayes department, arrested six trade unionists for taking part in a strike at the meat production cooperative, Cooperativa Frigorífico Neuland Ltda.
The workers were demanding that the company reinstate the 25 workers dismissed following the formation of a union on 14 February.
They were also calling on the company to stop its persecution of other trade union members and leaders.
Union bashing at national civil aviation administration, DINAC: In October 2009, the national civil aviation administration, DINAC, launched a campaign of anti-union practices against the leaders and members of the DINAC employees and workers' union, Sindicato de Empleados y Obreros de la Dinac, SEODINAC.
The management threatened to sack the trade unionists, ordered arbitrary transfers, and refused to pay the bonuses that form part of the salaries of over 1,380 workers spread across the country.
It also promoted the formation of yellow unions, which would allow it to make mass dismissals and to privatise the industry.
The trade union movement called on the heads of DINAC to respect the right to freedom of association, collective bargaining, trade union stability, and to fulfil the commitments made by the government of President Lugo.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Peru
Temporary contracts, mass dismissals and labour outsourcing were utilised to flout workers' labour and trade union rights.
Unwarranted government intervention assisted employers in their efforts to break strikes.
While fundamental trade union rights are recognised, certain problems exist in the law.
Both public and private sector workers are free to form and join trade unions without prior authorisation, however the minimum membership required by law to create unions is too high.
Temporary workers are not allowed to join the same union as permanent workers.
The law does not protect workers against anti-union actions, as it allows employers to sack workers without any justification in return for payment of severance pay.
The right to strike is also recognised, but is undermined by the fact that authorisation from the Ministry of Labour is required to call a strike.
Furthermore, the Ministry has the power to end a strike if it poses a serious risk to the enterprise or the sector of production or if it could have serious consequences due to its size.
The Administrative Labour Authority – and not the courts – has the responsibility for declaring whether or not a strike is legal, and can also determine the extent of the minimum service if the parties fail to reach an agreement.
Finally, a Ministerial Resolution provides for the creation of a national register of substitute teachers to replace striking teachers.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
The application of the measures to implement the free trade agreement has also had repercussion on the labour and trade union rights of the population in general.
This situation motivated the trade union movement to keep up its fight against the government's policies and to denounce the Peruvian state as a human rights violator to the Committee on the Application of Standards at the 98th International Labour Conference.
Workers ill-treated at Corporación Texpop S.A.: Practices violating workers' rights are commonplace, especially in the textile sector.
One example is clothing manufacturer Corporación Texpop S.A. The company imposes 12-hour days on its workers, fixes the clock-in system so that it can pay them less, ignores the provisions of the collective agreement, unfairly dismisses workers complaining about poor working conditions, as well as withholding the severance pay and social benefits owed to dismissed workers.
Undue state interference and strike busting by management: In March, the AMBEV beer company workers' union, Sindicato Único de Trabajadores de la Compañía Cervecera AMBEV Perú S.A.C.
(SUTAMBEV), asked the Labour Authority of Sullana, in the department of Piura, to assess and draw up the report on the list of demands, with a view to assessing the company's economic position.
Almost two months later, the authority had still not responded, and the company proceeded to launch a series of anti-union practices.
Finally, the Labour Authority declared the strike at the AMBEV plant legal, but unduly ruled that the stoppage should only affect unionised workers, a decision the trade union had to appeal against.
While the appeal was underway, the company began placing workers that had not taken part in the strike in the posts held by the strikers.
AMBEV's anti-union action led to a serious work accident that almost cost the life of a worker, Martín Poicón Vega, who had been assigned to a task for which he was not qualified.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Philippines
Trade union activities are hampered by excessive legal restrictions, especially concerning the right to strike.
Against a backdrop of a high-level ILO mission to the Philippines to investigate allegations of the murder and abduction of trade unionists, the killing, kidnapping and disappearances continued: three trade union officials were shot and killed by unknown assassins and one died after being interrogated by state security forces; three other union members were abducted; one former trade union leader was arrested and charged with murder.
Army personnel also harassed and intimated striking workers.
While basic trade union rights are guaranteed in the Constitution, they are limited by numerous provisions.
Foreign nationals may not form or join a union unless there is a reciprocal agreement between the countries, and all "contract" workers are excluded.
The conditions for obtaining union recognition are too strict, and the names of all the members the union seeks to organise must be provided.
Further restrictions on union activities include the requirement that union leaders be employed in the same enterprise as the workers they represent, and all foreign assistance is subject to prior permission of the Secretary of Labour.
In addition, in order to call a lawful strike, all conciliation procedures must have been exhausted, a majority of the union's members must agree on the strike, and prior notice must be given 30 days in advance in the event of bargaining deadlocks.
Both the President and the Secretary of Labour and Employment have broad powers to stop strikes in industries that are "indispensable to the national interest", which seriously limits the right to strike.
Strikes are banned in the public sector, and the law prescribes heavy penalties for participation in an illegal strike: Union leaders are liable to imprisonment of up to three years, and anyone who organises activities for "spreading propaganda", which include picketing, may face life imprisonment.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Background: The situation in the Philippines is getting worse.
During 2009, there were 120 human rights violations that concerned civil and political rights – affecting some 1,500 workers – out of 270 reported human rights cases.
Trade unions confronted a culture of impunity in the face of continued attacks and the lack of political will by the Arroyo administration to bring due process and the rule of law to Filipino workers.
The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) demanded a full investigation to bring to justice those responsible for the biggest single massacre of working journalists in recent history, in which 30 journalists were murdered when a political convoy of 57 persons was ambushed and slaughtered by gunmen in the Maguinadao Province of Southern Philippines.
Flagrant anti-union tactics: Trade union leaders continued to face harassment, arrest, and the loss of their jobs by the filing of false criminal charges.
One of the most common tactics used by private employers and government, alike, was to label union leaders and members as terrorists.
Faced with a legal system that offers little assistance or due process, trade unions persisted in their efforts.
Labour inspection abandoned in favour of voluntary compliance: The Labour Standards Enforcement Framework essentially abandons the principle of government labour inspection for workplaces with more than 200 workers.
Instead of a formal inspection, the order only requires self-regulation of labour standards among large companies and in companies where there is a union that has registered a collective bargaining agreement.
Murders of trade unionists mount: On 1 October, the ILO asked the Philippines to investigate serious allegations of murder and abductions of trade union leaders.
The ILO also urged the government to train and orient police officers and soldiers on the rights of workers to organise and to respect civil liberties.
During the year, a number of trade unionists were killed, including Edwin Oyeman of the National Federation of Sugar Workers (NFSW); Carlito B. Dacudao, a member of Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas (KMP); and Reynaldo Bucaling, Chairman of the Pakigdait sa Kalambu-an sa Kambayugo (PSK).
Joel Ascutia, President of Condor-Piston-Bikol, a union of jeepney drivers and operators, was also shot and seriously wounded by unknown gunmen.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Qatar
Migrant workers are still in a difficult situation.
The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) criticised the refusal to allow journalists to form their own independent trade union.
The law provides for a single trade union system, and trade union activities are heavily curtailed.
Trade union rights are seriously restricted in law.
The Labour Code allows for only one trade union: the General Union of Workers of Qatar, made up of General Committees for workers in different trades or industries.
Each of the General Committees must have a minimum of 100 members.
Government employees as well as non-Qatari nationals are not allowed to organise.
Although trade unions are allowed to bargain collectively, the government controls the rules and procedures for bargaining, including restrictions on the content, scope, duration and interpretation of the agreements.
Furthermore, while the right to strike is recognised, it is coupled with so many restrictions that it is virtually impossible to carry out a lawful strike.
The Labour Department of the Ministry of Civil Service must also rule on all industrial disputes before a strike can be called, which effectively neutralises the purpose of striking.
Civil servants and domestic workers are not allowed to strike, and no worker in a public utility, health or security service can strike if it harms the public or causes damage to property.
Workers in petroleum- and gas-related industries, seaports and all forms of transportation fall under this category.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Migrant workers exploited: Migrant workers make up the majority of the workforce.
They are often exploited because their employment contracts give broad powers to their employers.
The latter often confiscate the passports of migrant workers, and some refuse to pay salaries on time.
This was the case, for example, in the first half of the year for 39 Filipino and 31 Nepalese workers living in the Al Matar Al Qadeem labour camp.
They had not been paid for five months, even after a labour tribunal had urged the company to pay them.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Poland
Employers' hostility against trade unions is on the rise.
At least 20 men and women were dismissed for their trade union activities, although the unions were able to negotiate re-engagement for four of them.
A number of workers enjoy limited trade union rights, and the right to strike is hampered by excessive restrictions.
The law guarantees basic trade union rights, but a number of restrictions apply.
While all workers, with the exception of the self-employed, have the right to form and join the trade union of their choice, a single trade union system applies to a number of employees including policemen and fire-fighters.
Protection against anti-union dismissals is limited, as the number of union officials awarded protection is dependent on the size of the union.
Furthermore, while the right to collective bargaining is guaranteed in the Constitution, a number of workers in the civil service including key civil servants, appointed or elected employees of state and municipal bodies, court judges and prosecutors, do not enjoy that right.
The right to strike is seen as an element of collective disputes, can in general only be called if the parties do not reach an agreement through negotiations, and must be preceded by conciliation or mediation.
Also, to call a strike, a majority of all employees must vote in favour of the strike, which is excessive.
The list of "essential services" exceeds the ILO definition, and includes workers in the state administration and local government.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Background: Numerous strikes and protests took place during the year, in reaction to the economic crisis and the rapid loss of jobs.
The social partners' consensus on anti-crisis measures was modified by the government, much to the trade unions' disappointment.
More and more workers went for months without being paid, and police officers did not receive the social benefits that comprise a significant portion of their take-home pay.
In December, the death of two workers at the construction site of the National Stadium in Warsaw exposed a gross negligence of basic safety standards and drew attention to more general concerns about health and safety at work.
Reinstatement difficult after anti-union dismissals: Forming a trade union, asking for collective bargaining or fighting for workers' rights is frequently followed by a summary dismissal of the union's leaders.
The victims can ask for reinstatement, but court proceedings can take up to two years.
Moreover, the courts are increasingly awarding just three months' salary as compensation in lieu of reinstatement, regardless of how long the activist has been out of work.
Employers also claim that workers cannot be reinstated as the victim and the management would not be able to co-operate, and more and more judges are convinced that employers should not be forced to take back unfairly dismissed unionists as this could create a "conflict".
Organising a strike complicated: Employers are taking advantage of legal subtleties to curb workers' right to strike.
Failure to comply with all the minute requirements often leads to a strike being declared illegal, sometimes with harsh consequences.
For example, on 14 December the court ordered the members of the All-Poland Union of Nurses and Midwives at the Barlicki Hospital in Lodz to pay the hospital between 1,500 and 4,000 PLZ (more than 900 euros) in damages for participating in a strike in 2008.
The nurses had announced that the strike would last for four days, but the prosecutor's office used a different method for counting the days, and declared that the strike had gone over its limit.
International campaign to protect dismissed trade unionists at LOT Polish Airlines: In July, Ewira Niemiec, president of the Cabin Crew Trade Union, and Grzegorz Kossowski, president of the LOT Polish Airlines Employees' Union, were illegally sacked during collective bargaining negotiations with LOT Polish Airlines.
LOT had previously dismissed workers who won legal cases against the company, and had threatened unions that it would file for bankruptcy.
The employer also announced plans to replace the collective bargaining agreement with a new contract, which would result in redundancies and wage cuts.
The International Transport Federation (ITF), together with the European Transport Federation (ETF) launched an international solidarity campaign.
On 9 October, an agreement package was finally settled including the reinstatement of Niemiec and Kossowski.
Activist reinstated after anti-union dismissal: Marcin Strozynski, a 22-year old man who organised a trade union in the municipally-owned company Grodziskie Przedsiebiorstwo Komunalne Sp.
z o.o.
was dismissed in August.
On 31 August members of NSZZ-Solidarnosc affiliated trade unions in the Wielkopolska Region arranged a rally at the gates of the Town Hall demanding Strozynski's reinstatement.
Discussions between the management and the town mayor eventually led to Strozynski being allowed to return to work in November.
Dismissals and intimidation at Officina Labor: Michal Szwarc, the leader of NSZZ Solidarnosc in the Rzgow branch of Officina Labor Sp.
z o.o., was dismissed on 15 September, just one day after the management had been informed of the establishment of a company trade union.
Seven more trade union officers were dismissed the next day.
Szwarc, who was unofficially told that his dismissal was for "trade union conspiracy", also reported that he had been followed by a company car, and that his mother-in-law had been intimidated by the person driving that car.
Trade unionists informed the prosecutor's office about the intimidation, and organised a solidarity rally.
The dismissals were still pending review in the Labour Court at the end of the year.
The YouGov poll gave Millband senior a 36% to 32% lead on first preferences, which it suggested could be converted to a 51% to 49% win for his brother Ed by the final round.
The poll put Andy Burnham in third place with 12%, Ed Balls fourth on 11% and Diane Abbott on 9%.
Financial sector bonuses paid out to the lucky few in the five-month period between December and April for the previous financial year reached £10bn, compared with £8bn in 2008, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
The figures are likely to inflame the debate over banking industry pay at a time when there are massive public sector cuts combined with a pay freeze and banks also under fire for not doing enough to support the UK economy.
Far from costing taxpayers money, trade union involvement has a very positive impact on the workplace.
Research commissioned by the Department for Business in 2007 suggested that effective and engaged union representation saves the public purse between £170m and £400m a year by improving retention, training take-up, health and safety, and dispute resolution; and as much as £3.6bn a year through general productivity gains.
"Putting to one side the obvious employee relations ramifications of extending a no-strike ban to other essential public services, there are legal risks associated with such a move.
The European Convention of Human Rights provides for a right to freedom of association, including the right to join a trade union.
Recent decisions from the European Court of Human Rights suggest that freedom of assembly may extend to include the right to strike.
However, it should be noted that the right to freedom of assembly is not absolute; the Convention provides that the right can be restricted, for example, in the interests of public safety and health.
In addition, the armed forces, police and some civil servants are excluded altogether.
Unfortunately, very little guidance exists as to how these rights can be lawfully restricted, such as curtailing the right to strike.
Therefore if the government were to seek to introduce further restrictions to the right to strike in essential public services, in light of the Convention rights that apply in the UK, it is probable that such changes would be vehemently opposed by the major public sector trade unions and would be likely to come up against legal pitfalls, including a European legal challenge.

2007 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Qatar
Limited trade union rights: A new labour code came into force in January 2005.
It allows for free trade unions, but only for Qatari nationals.
It contains many restrictions.
A union must have a minimum membership of 100 workers, and those working in the government sector are not allowed to organise.
The new constitution that came into force in January 2005 keeps ultimate power in the hands of the emir, but provides for a two-thirds elected advisory body.
It guarantees freedom of expression and assembly, both important rights for the full and free functioning of trade union organisations.
Collective bargaining: The new law allows trade unions to carry out collective bargaining, but that right is heavily curtailed by the government's control over the rules and procedures for bargaining.
Severe limitations on the right to strike: Although the new code recognises the right to strike, it contains so many obstacles that it is extremely difficult to do so within the law.
Civil servants and domestic workers cannot strike.
No worker in a public utility, health or security service can strike if it harms the public or causes damage to property.
In the private sector, although most workers have the right to strike, they can only do so after the Labour Department of the Ministry of Civil Service has ruled on the dispute, which effectively neutralises the purpose of striking.
Foreign workers have tended not to draw attention to problems with their employers for fear of repatriation.
Repeated strikes: Despite the legal restrictions, strikes and sit-ins have been held, mostly owing to non-payment of wages.
In March 2006, for example, 1,500 Nepalese workers stopped work in a construction firm.
They were protesting about wage arrears of between two and six months and salary deductions to cover visa costs.
On 4 November 2006, 2,000 construction workers downed tools and demanded wage increases and better working conditions.
Arrests and repatriation of strikers: On 13 April in Ras Laffan, around a thousand migrant workers were involved in scuffles with the police and the army, which carried out many arrests.
The demonstration had broken out following the discovery of the dead bodies of two Nepalese workers in a workers' dormitory.
The protesters also insisted on access to health care, decent housing and better food.
In December, 150 Nepalese workers from a food company went on strike.
They denounced the ridiculously long working hours which were not even paid as overtime.
The employer responded by accusing three Nepalese workers of theft.
Despite the demonstrators' protests, the three Nepalese were taken to a detention centre and later deported.
2007 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Poland
No relevant legislative changes nor, regrettably, significant improvement in the practical implementation of trade union rights can be reported.
At least 37 trade unionists, half of them trade union officials, were dismissed for their trade union activities.
Freedom of Association – with restrictions: The law gives all workers, including civilian employees of the armed forces, police and border guards, the right to form and join trade unions.
However, civil servants cannot hold a trade union post, which restricts a trade union's right to elect their representatives.
Trade union law is interpreted as applying to employees and civil servants only, which means that the self-employed or those working on the basis of individual or civil contracts may not form or join unions, and unions may not defend them.
A minimum of ten people may form a local union and 30 a national one.
Trade union organisations are required to give employers quarterly reports on the total number of trade union members.
The law recognises trade union pluralism with the exception of policemen, border guards and prison guards, firemen of the State Fire Brigades and the employees of the Highest Supervision Chamber, where the single trade union system applies.
Collective bargaining: Collective bargaining is a recognised and protected right.
This was further strengthened on 23 May 2006 when the Supreme Court confirmed that the social clauses negotiated as part of the privatisation process but poorly implemented in the past were fully enforceable.
Anti-union discrimination is banned.
Labour laws, including those which protect trade union rights, apply in the special economic zones.
Labour Code reform uncertain: The 2006 Survey (covering 2005) reported the controversial proposal for a new Labour Code that would have diminished workers' and trade union rights and which trade unions strongly opposed.
In September 2006 the amended proposal was unveiled and it still includes a number of problematic provisions, such as less protection from dismissal for trade union officials and greater court intervention in the right to strike.
However, this proposal has not been debated yet and the government has not been pushing for its adoption.
Limited protection for trade union officials: The number of union officials protected from dismissal is dependent on the size of the union's membership.
In some instances, only one union representative can be protected from dismissal, leaving many trade union officials without protection from anti-union discrimination.
Limitations on the right to strike and rules that curb trade union events: The right to strike is recognised, other than in essential services which are broadly defined (exceeding the ILO definition) to include uniformed services, state administration and local government, where workers only have the right to protest.
Procedures for calling a strike are long and cumbersome.
However, a strike may be organised without complying with these procedures if negotiations or conciliation become impossible due to the employer's unlawful behaviour, or if the employer fired a trade union official who represented workers in the dispute.
The law defines a strike as a collective refusal to work, and strikes that fall outside this definition are not permitted.
The law on road traffic security (amended in 2005 without consultation with trade unions) imposes a number of complicated obligations on an organisation that wishes to organise a public event.
According to the NSZZ Solidarnosc, this law has been used to prevent trade union rallies.
Trade unionists are often summarily dismissed on disciplinary grounds.
Workers wishing to form or join a trade union have been intimidated or even dismissed straight after informing the employer that a trade union had been formed or when a collective dispute takes place.
Some employers have only given bonuses and promotions to non-unionised workers, and banned trade union workplace meetings.
Workers are allowed to turn to labour courts, but procedures are lengthy and implementation is not effective.
The NSZZ Solidarnosc confederation (affiliated to the ITUC) reported that, in 2006, half of the sentences and agreements supervised by the labour inspectorate were not enforced.
In cases of unfair dismissal, it has often proved difficult to ensure the reinstatement of the workers concerned.
In the case of Jutrzenka SA in Poznan the dismissed shop steward was reinstated to his job and his trade union post, but the employer rented an office for the trade union outside of the company premises, and the shop steward was prevented from visiting the workplace.
Consultation rights ignored: Employers often ignore the law that obliges them to consult trade unions prior to making decisions that affect workers.
For example, Radio Opole SA attempted to introduce the new works regulations without consulting the union.
New forms of work to escape trade unions: Many workers in state-owned enterprises such as the health sector, water and forestry industries have had their employment contracts terminated and replaced by individual contracts.
Other workers, especially in the transport and construction sectors, have been fired and then re-hired as self-employed.
In either case, the workers can no longer be trade union members.
A growing number of people are forced to take jobs in the informal economy, where they are not entitled to join a trade union.
Legal strikes too complicated: Employers frequently do not respect the right to strike and they force workers to sign declarations that they will not join a strike.
Moreover, long and complicated strike procedures mean that many strikes are carried out illegally.
As a result, strikers risk losing their social benefits and union organisations risk having to pay damages.
The All-Poland alliance of trade unions reported a new practice, whereby law enforcement bodies tried to intimidate trade unionists prior to the commencement of a strike.
The police spoke several times with trade union officials supporting the strike action in a salt mining factory in Inowroclaw, for example.
Background: Parties described as populist or even nationalist joined the conservative government.
Unemployment reached 15 per cent in December, the highest in the EU.
Non-payment of wages remained a problem, with almost 37 thousand enterprises inspected by the State Labour Inspectorate proving to be dishonest in this respect.
Irregular overtime, miscalculation of working hours and denial of holidays and days off work became common practice and blatant violations of workers' rights in supermarkets came to public attention.
In general, however, the workers rarely protest for the fear of losing their jobs.
Ban on organising at the Stokrotka supermarket network: The Stokrotka network (about 1,500 employees, 80 per cent of whom are very low-paid), owned by the "Eldorado" company, became infamous when its employees informed the press of the blatant violations of labour rights, including the management ban on organising.
These accusations were later confirmed by the labour inspectorate.
NSZZ Solidarnosc still exists in the company, although only the trade union's officials are public about their membership.
In December two workers were summarily dismissed just because the management noticed them talking to a shop steward.
The Head Labour Inspectorate instigated a general inquiry into the situation at the company.
No outcome was available at the time of writing.
Trade unionists dismissed at Selgros: A primary level union of NSZZ Solidarnosc at the Selgros retail network market in Wroclaw was registered in December.
The newly-elected shop steward immediately notified the management that a trade union had been formed, only to be dismissed from work the very same day, along with two other trade union organisers.
To circumvent the dismissal protection rules for workers' representatives, the management pre-dated the dismissal notice by three days.
When the shop steward, refusing to accept the dismissal, came to work the next day, the company security guards removed him from the premises.
In a period of 30 days the company dismissed a total of nine people who were linked to the formation of the union.
Undercover investigation into trade union activities: The position of private security employees in Poland is extremely precarious, with many working 300-400 hours per month for the average hourly wage of one euro, often without contracts.
The security workers of Warsaw had been trying to organise for several months, but when two workers from the Ekotrade security agency came to the NSZZ Solidarnosc office in Warsaw to join a trade union, they were, in fact, the employers' representatives using fake names.
Unfortunately, they managed to spot a genuine Ekotrade employee during their visit, proving he was engaged in trade union activities.
He was dismissed over the telephone after he left the office.
Union members barred from new company: The management of Miranda SA in Turek established a subsidiary company Miranda Ltd. Workers who wished to be transferred there were told that they could only be employed if they voluntarily resigned from their old jobs and their trade union membership.
They were also required to sign a declaration that they would never form or join a trade union.
According to the trade union at Miranda SA, the management sabotaged the appointment of a mediator and other procedures related to this collective dispute.
Driven underground: The management of PKS SA in Minsk Mazowiecki deprived the trade union's enterprise commission of the right to use a room on the premises, preventing the commission from carrying out its work.
In the meantime the shop steward was illegally dismissed and subsequently the whole trade union has had to work underground.
A court ruled that the dismissal was illegal, but ordered no reinstatement since it would be, in the court's view, "pointless".
Anti-union surveillance at Zywiec Trade: The Zywiec Trade company in the city of Lodz denied their workers' unions a separate working space.
The union liaison body managed to obtain an office only thanks to the prosecutor's intervention.
In the meantime trade union meetings were recorded by management and the union telephone line was bugged.
The company CEO also attempted to get their own "candidate", who was persuaded to represent the employer's interests with the promise of a pay rise, elected as a trade union official.
Interference at Frito Lay: On 13 January Frito Lay Poland Ltd (a branch of PepsiCo international) in Grodzisk Mazowiecki distributed a form for their workers to sign, which contained statements on their resignation from the trade union.
The form had to be returned in five days.
The union had been in dispute with the company since 2004 over a sexual harassment case.
Union busting at Media Markt: On 15 September, two days after a trade union was organised, the shop steward of the temporary workers' enterprise commission, Mr. Andrzej Rosinki was dismissed on disciplinary grounds.
As a result, workers who had previously expressed their intention to become trade union members changed their minds.
Some workers were asked to sign a declaration that there was no need for a trade union in the company.
Two of the 19 trade union members resigned due to the employer's harassment, two left as their fixed-term contracts were not renewed and one was dismissed.
The Gdansk regional board of NSZZ Solidarnosc organised a rally in defence of the dismissed shop steward.
Harassment at PKS Connex Ltd. in Kolobrzeg: Lower-level management exerted pressure on employees to make them denounce the activities of the trade union's enterprise commission.
The situation became more tense after the trade union asked the national labour inspectorate to investigate the calculation of overtime.
The management missed no opportunity to harass trade union members.
Retaliation for speaking up: On 11 September POLFA S.A. in Warsaw dismissed Mr. Piotr Krolik, an activist from the All Poland Alliance of Trade Unions, OPZZ, after he disclosed bad practice by company management.
The OPZZ took the company to court for unfair dismissal.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Romania
Organising can be difficult, and legal protection often has little effect in practice.
The right to strike is seriously circumscribed in law, and compulsory arbitration is possible even in non-essential services.
Trade union rights remain inadequate, although revisions of relevant labour laws have been initiated with ILO assistance.
The 2003 Trade Union Law recognises the right of workers to establish and join a trade union.
While the law provides for sanctions for obstructing union activities, those sanctions cannot be applied in practice due to loopholes in the Penal Code.
Collective bargaining is only possible in workplaces where there is at least 21 employees, and collective disputes can be referred to compulsory arbitration by virtue of the Labour Disputes Settlement Act.
Moreover, a lawful strike can only be called in defence of workers' economic interests, and is only possible where all means of conciliation have failed.
Compulsory arbitration is also available where a strike lasts more than 20 days.
Should a court declare a strike illegal, the trade union has to pay damages and its leaders may be fired.
A minimum service of one third of the normal activity must be provided in the event of a strike in a number of sectors.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Organising obstructed: In recent years some employers have been trying to block the creation of trade unions within companies and have even warned workers against discussing unionisation with outsiders.
There have been reports that unscrupulous employers – usually foreign companies – make employment conditional upon the worker agreeing not to create or join a union.
If a trade union representative loses his or her job, he or she will hardly ever be allowed back to the company premises to meet with trade union members.
Self-employed workers who wish to form or join a union are especially at risk.
Sanctions ineffective: Although anti-union activities are prohibited, the sanctions for restricting trade union activities are rarely, if ever, applied in practice.
The procedure for lodging a complaint is too complicated, and the authorities do not prioritise the trade unions' complaints.
There are also reports that labour inspectorates do not always respect the confidentiality of the complaints, and that some employers prefer facing penalties to complying with the labour law.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Rwanda
The two national trade union centres deplored the shortcomings of social dialogue, particularly the way the authorities overlooked several of their demands during work on the reform of the labour code.
Free collective bargaining is not guaranteed, and the right to strike is hampered by lengthy procedures.
Problematic areas remain in the labour law despite the adoption of a new Labour Code in May 2009.
While the Code and the Constitution guarantee freedom of association, there are no provisions that secure trade union rights in the public sector.
In addition, to be recognised as the most representative organisation, a union must allow the labour administration to check the register of its members and property, which could allow for government interference.
Furthermore, a collective agreement shall be negotiated within a joint committee convened by the Minister of Labour at the request of only one of the parties.
All collective labour disputes are also subject to mandatory conciliation, and are referred to an arbitration committee set up by the National Labour Council if an agreement can not reached.
Strikes are forbidden until all the procedures have been exhausted, which can take more than two months.
Finally, the terms and conditions for exercising the right to strike will be determined by a Minister's Order.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Trade unions not consulted enough: The Rwandan Workers' Trade Union Centre (CESTRAR) and the Fraternity and Labour Congress of Rwanda (COTRAF), the two national centres affiliated to the ITUC, criticised the new version of the labour code adopted on 27 May.
Despite their protests, labour legislation was amended to make it more flexible and more favourable to investors.
CESTRAR can clearly see the influence of the World Bank, whose annual report "Doing Business", heavily criticised by the international trade union movement for discouraging countries from adopting social protection programmes, congratulates Rwanda for its reforms because "employers are no longer required to consult beforehand [about job cuts] with the employees' representatives or notify the labor inspector".
Despite some progress, such as the establishment of the National Labour Council, the trade unions were rarely consulted during the preparation of draft legislation and were very poorly represented on social security management structures.
2007 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Rwanda
The Rwandan government has promised to amend its Labour Code to take into account criticisms regarding the non-recognition of the right to organise of civil servants and the right to strike in essential services.
Workers have the right to form trade unions.
Union membership is voluntary and open to all salaried workers, including public sector employees.
However, there are no provisions guaranteeing this right for civil servants.
Under the 2002 Labour Code, drawn up with technical support from the ILO, agricultural workers now have the right to organise.
This Code also allows foreign workers to be elected to trade union office after they have lived in the country for at least five years, provided non-nationals do not exceed one third of the union's officers.
Right to strike: The Labour Code restricts the right to strike.
Authorisation for strikes is subject to the compulsory intervention of a Mediation Committee, but there are still no implementing provisions to establish that committee.
Hence since 2002, a legal vacuum has prevented the real exercise of this right.
Furthermore, the list of so-called "essential services", in which strikes are not allowed, is excessively long.
The Rwandan government has promised to amend its Code to take into account criticisms regarding the organising rights of civil servants and the right to strike in essential services.
Exercising the right to strike is sometimes confused with "disturbing public order", an offence that is severely punished by law and seriously impedes unions' ability to exercise this right.
Rwanda's trade union rights record has been poor.
The authorities have, in the past, interfered in trade union affairs and employers have shown hostility to unions, with little or no retribution.
The government appears to be trying to improve relations with trade unions.
For example, it has allowed the organisation of elections to determine the representativeness of the trade union organisations, but suspicions remain that it is still seeking to manipulate them.
State employees are no longer banned by law from publicly expressing their views on political, philosophical or trade union matters, but behind the scenes, there is clearly pressure on them not to, say the unions.
Persistent anti-union harassment: Employers frequently intimidate trade unionists who are too militant for their liking.
They do this through transfers, demotions and dismissals.
In January 2005, for example, the telecommunications company RWANDATEL, sacked Anathalie Mukayihi, the treasurer of the union committee of the telecommunications union, SYATEL, a CESTRAR affiliate.
Sister Mukayihi was sacked after complaining about a pay cut decided unilaterally by her employer and for trying to organise the employees affected by the measure.
Her attitude was regarded as a "subversive act".
The company has been bought since then by a multinational, which has just sacked 130 people.
The union delegates at the company received no protection during this process.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Senegal
Interference by the authorities and political parties led to the creation of new organisations, usually either not very representative or not representative at all, undermining social dialogue.
Trade union activists were suspended, dismissed and beaten.
Union recognition is subject to the authorities' discretion, and the right to strike is very limited.
Freedom of association and the right to strike are guaranteed in the Constitution but are marred by a number of restrictions.
The Ministry of Interior has discretionary powers to grant or refuse registration of a union, and the registration procedure is often very long.
Collective agreements are signed between workers and employers under state arbitration.
The right to strike is heavily restricted, most notably due to a provision in the 2001 Constitution which stipulates that strike action must not infringe upon the freedom to work or jeopardise the enterprise.
The authorities also have broad powers to requisition workers to replace those on strike.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Political interference and frequent breakdown of social dialogue: Many unions have complained of the government's authoritarian attitude and the lack of any real social dialogue.
The country's principal organisations have criticised manoeuvres by politicians, and attempts to take over and divide the trade union movement.
At least three national centres were created in 2009, making a total of 20.
The education sector, which has already suffered severe budget cuts, was the main victim of political interference.
The most representative organisations responded by grouping together.
The holding of trade union elections is considered a priority.
In April, Mamadou Diouf, General Secretary of the National Confederation of Autonomous Trade Unions of Senegal (CSA) protested that the authorities ignored his organisation.
Persistent anti-union discrimination: The National Workers Confederation of Senegal (CNTS) pointed out that some trade unions had been recognised without even holding an assembly or congress, while other organisations had had to wait years for official recognition.
The National Union of Autonomous Trade Unions of Senegal (UNSAS) mentioned that in many enterprises workers still did not have the right or the possibility of electing their staff representatives, that activists were stalked, threatened with transfers or dismissed and that despite court rulings ordering the reinstatement of dismissed trade unionists managers were slow to comply.
Trade unionist unlawfully detained by hospital director: On 19 January, Souleymane Djigueul, leader of the local branch of the General Workers' Federation of Senegal (FGTS) was locked in the office of and beaten by Mourade Dièye Guèye, the director of the Abass Ndao hospital in Dakar and a high ranking town councillor.
The workers had criticised the management of the establishment and two months of salary arrears.
Social unrest continued at the hospital however, as in the rest of the health sector.
At the end of the year, a demonstration by the Health Workers' Federation, grouping members of several national trade union centres, was organised to demand the urgent application of measures promised by the government since 2006 and the signature of a decree to appoint a new director at the Abass Ndao hospital.
Five staff representatives sacked for calling a strike: The "Les Salins" company in Kaolack dismissed five staff representatives following a strike on 16 November.
According to the National Union of Autonomous Trade Unions of Senegal (UNSAS) and the National Workers' Confederation of Senegal (CNTS) who took up the workers' defence, a strike notice was duly filed within the prescribed time limit.
Four representatives of railway workers union suspended: On 2 December, management at the railway company Transrail suspended Cheik NDjene, general secretary of the Railway Workers' Federation (FETRAIL) and Mamadou Madiodio Diagne and Mame Demba Diakhaté, general secretary and administrative secretary respectively of the Autonomous Railway Workers' Union (SATRAIL) for "inciting a work stoppage, obstructing the smooth running of the company and organising a general assembly without prior authorisation".
A few weeks earlier, another FETRAIL representative, Abdoul Azizz Diagne was suspended for insulting the company director.
Sixty members of the railway workers' unions were also suspended.
Several trade unionists were harassed by police as they tried to get to their workplace.
One official was severely wounded.
According to the unions, the Belgian director of this private company (operating in Senegal and Mali) had ignored a formal warning by the labour inspector that the sanctions were illegal.
A recovery plan, the announcement of several hundred dismissals and broken promises were the cause of the dispute which lasted several months.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Singapore
The vast majority of unionised workers are members of a union affiliated to the National Trade Union Congress (NTUC), which serves as a proxy for the ruling People's Action Party (PAP).
Trade union activities are strictly regulated, and the authorities have broad powers to intervene.
Although basic trade union rights are recognised, they are subject to restrictions.
The Constitution guarantees the right to join and form trade unions, however Parliament may impose limitations on formation on grounds of security, public order or morality.
The Registrar also has vast powers to refuse to register a union or cancel registration, and may decide whether to approve a new union's rules or changes to an existing union's rules.
Government employees are prohibited from joining trade unions, although the President has the right to make exceptions to this provision.
Foreign nationals' access to union official posts is subject to permission by the Minister of Manpower.
Furthermore, unions may not freely determine how to use their funds.
While the right to collective bargaining is recognised, all collective agreements must be certified by the tripartite Industrial Arbitration Court, which can refuse certification on the grounds of public interest.
Union democracy is hampered by the fact that union members no longer have the power to accept or reject collective agreements negotiated on their behalf.
In addition, in limited situations, the law provides for compulsory arbitration by the request of only one of the parties to an industrial dispute.
To call a strike, 50% plus one of all the trade union's members must vote in favour, and there is no specific legal protection for striking workers.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Restrictions not applied: Practice suggests that many of the laws are outdated, as in reality many of the potential restrictions on trade union rights are not applied.
The unions have called for these outdated restrictions to be removed from the country's legislation.
Close ties with ruling party: With the exception of six unions, the rest of the country's 62 unions are affiliated with the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC), which is closely linked to the ruling People's Action Party (PAP).
The NTUC Secretary General currently serves on the PAP Central Executive Committee.
The NTUC secretary general also holds a seat in the Cabinet as a minister in the Prime Minister's Office.
Trade unions may not contribute to political parties, and the NTUC does not permit members supportive of opposition policies to hold office.
The NTUC-PAP relationship, which dates back to the founding of the NTUC in 1961, is described as "symbiotic" and was formally endorsed in 1980 at the NTUC Ordinary Delegates Conference.
It was publicly reaffirmed in December 2004.
Currently, there are 16 PAP MPs with direct or former ties to the NTUC.
Foreign domestic workers' difficulties to organise: Foreign domestic workers have little opportunity to organise to defend their rights or demand improvements in their conditions of work.
Labour laws exclude approximately 180,000 migrant domestic workers from key protections guaranteed to other workers, such as a weekly day off, limits on working hours, annual leave, paid holidays, and caps on salary deductions.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Swaziland
Trade union rights are restricted, and lawful collective action is virtually impossible.
The country's highly respected trade union leader, Jan Sithole, continued to face harassment, including death threats.
Bank workers' collective bargaining demands were continually ignored.
Trade unions face a harsh legal environment.
The 2006 Constitution entrenches the State of Emergency in force since 1973, which suspends constitutional freedoms.
It also invests all power in the King's hands, bans opposition political parties and meetings, and gives the government the ultimate executive, judicial and legislative authority.
Workers in export processing zones are exempted from freedom of association.
To obtain recognition, a union must represent at least 50% of the workers in a given workplace, or be voluntarily recognised by the employer.
Collective bargaining is allowed by virtue of the Industrial Relations Act.
Furthermore, the right to strike is severely limited, as the procedures for voting on strike action are complex and the procedures for announcing a strike are very long, lasting up to 74 days.
Trade unions also face civil liability for any damage caused during a strike.
The list of "essential services" exceeds the ILO definition.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Background: Political parties remain banned and the country has been in State of Emergency for over 35 years.
Unemployment is widespread, about 70% of the population live below the poverty line and the country has the world's highest rate of HIV infection.
Swazilad Federation of Trade Unions (SFTU) official, Sibusiso Mashaya ,was murdered in May by a local gang, although it appeared to be criminal violence not directly related to his trade union activity.
In September, the leader of the opposition PUDEMO party, Mario Masuki, was released from prison, after being detained since November 2008 under anti-terror laws.
Repression in the textile sector: The textile sector has become notorious for its anti-labour and anti-union practices, particularly foreign-owned companies, principally from Taiwan, who employ a mainly female workforce.
Any protests about their poor working conditions are dealt with severely.
In March 2008, police intervened against thousands of textile workers engaged in a legal strike to demand higher wages.
The workers, mainly women, were hit with tear gas canisters, beaten heavily with batons and shot at with what were suspect to be live rounds.
Trade unions under fire: In the absence of any credible political opposition, trade unions in Swaziland have been in the forefront of efforts to promote democracy.
As a result, they have been a target of constant harassment and repression.
Union leaders have been arrested, protesters beaten and political parties banned.
Speaking at the International Labour Conference in June, the General Secretary of the Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions (SFTU), Jan Sithole reported that he had been a victim of police harassment and arrests, and that he and his family have been receiving death threats.
At the end of its proceedings, the Conference's Committee on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations of the ILO devoted a special paragraph to Swaziland in its report, a measure reserved for the worst cases of rights violations.
Unions still refused recognition: The authorities have continued to refuse recognition to the Swaziland Police Association (SPA) and the Swaziland Correctional Service Union (SWACU).
Additionally, union activity is not effectively protected against employers' interference, although the law protects unions from governmental interference.
It has been reported that employers' interference with workers' councils has contributed to the failure of some trade unions to negotiate collective agreements.
Furthermore, there are reports that some employers dictate which decisions are taken in the workers' councils.
Bank obstructs collective bargaining: By the end of July, SWAZIBANK and Swaziland Union of Financial Institutions and Allied Workers (SUFIAW) had been re-negotiating their collective agreement since September 2007.
The bank was expected to produce and deliver a counter proposal to the union's draft collective agreement on or about 29 April, 2009.
The bank did not deliver the counter proposal as expected.
At a further meeting on July 29, when no counter proposal was on the table, the union decided to refer the matter to the Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration Commission (CMAC).
The Industrial Court later ordered both sides back to the negotiating table, urging them to bargain in good faith.

2008 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Swaziland
In practice, the last absolute monarchy in Africa has no respect at all for trade union rights.
Many legal restrictions: The current Industrial Relations Act (IRA), from the year 2000, allows workers to form trade unions, to draw up their own constitutions, and to negotiate their terms and conditions of employment.
Police officers are not allowed to form unions.
However, unions must represent at least 50 per cent of workers in a workplace to ensure recognition, (an unreasonably high percentage) and failure of this test leads to recognition being dependent on the employer's goodwill.
There is also no effective protection for trade unions against employer interference.
Strike action virtually impossible: The procedure for announcing a strike is long, lasting up to 74 days, and the procedures for voting on strike action are complex, thus making legal strikes virtually impossible.
Should a strike take place, the trade union faces civil liability for any damage caused during a strike.
The IRA prohibits protest actions in "essential services," which include police and security forces, correctional services, fire fighting, health and many civil service positions.
Government fails to fulfil its promise to bring in improved labour legislation: Repeated government assurances to the ILO that it will amend its legislation to bring it in line with international labour standards have so far proved meaningless.
Trade union rights in practice and Violations in 2007
Attempts to discredit union leader: The trade unions, in particular the national centre, the Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions (SFTU), face fierce government attacks.
The SFTU General Secretary, Jan Sithole, has become a hate figure for the regime, with smear campaigns against him, imprisonment several times in recent years and death threats to him and his family.
Government policy: The regime has turned a blind eye as employers pursue casualisation and deregulation policies which have resulted in many skilled employees (who are largely trade union members) losing their jobs.
The effect of such policies in the sugar processing and hotel sectors has been to weaken the trade unions.
Thanks to the pressure brought to bear by the US union centre AFL-CIO, which is able to press for the withdrawal of Swaziland's preferential access to the US market under the Generalised System of Preferences, improvements have been secured in the labour legislation, but they still need to be put into practice.
Any improvements in the working conditions of EPZ workers are attributable to the inspectors sent by the buyers and not the government's labour inspectors.
Refusal to recognise two unions: Throughout the year, the authorities avoided recognising the Swaziland Police Association (SPA) and the Swaziland Correctional Service Union (SWACU), although the new Constitution had opened up this possibility through allowing all workers to form and join trade unions.
However the police chief and the head of the prison administration, along with the government, refused all the trade unionists' demands, arguing that the Industrial Relations Act (IRA) bans members of those professions from creating and belonging to trade unions.
In June, an international delegation of police trade union leaders tried in vain to meet the Prime Minister, who avoided meeting them by claiming prior engagements.
In December, the Prime Minister rejected a request by police officers to hold a strike, referring again to the IRA, which classifies them as essential services.
At the end of the year Alpheous Mhlanga, the leader of the SPA, was still without a job and receiving only half his pay for alleged "professional misconduct" linked to an attempt to get his organisation registered in February 2006.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Sudan
There was no improvement in Sudan where no independent trade union activity is tolerated.
The 2000 Labour Code essentially denies trade union freedoms.
Furthermore, the 1992 Trade Union Act only allows one trade union federation, the state-controlled Sudan Workers Trade Union Federation (SWTUF), and independent unions are banned.
The government regulates most aspects of the trade unions' activities, including elections, their organisational structure and alliances, and the unions' funds are controlled by the Auditor General.
Although labour disputes are adjudicated by the labour courts, the Minister of Labour can refer them to compulsory arbitration.
Legal strike action is practically impossible as all strikes must be approved by the government.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Dismal rights record: Sudan is a non-democratic, authoritarian country whose human and trade union rights record is a matter of serious concern.
Trade unionists outside the pro-government trade unions live under constant fear and do not dare denounce inhuman conditions of work.
It appears that independent trade unionists are not able to participate in international trade union meetings for fear of reprisal when they return home.
Accurate information about the numbers of trade unionists in prison is difficult to obtain and their whereabouts is unknown.
Some tolerance is shown to trade unions within the official structures.
In January, the Sea Ports Trade Union publicly opposed any plans to partially or fully privatise Port Sudan Harbour, as it could jeopardise workers jobs.
Their position was supported by the official Sudan Workers' Trade Union Federation (SWTUF).
SWTUF colludes in government surveillance of oil workers: In the oil-producing regions, police and secret service agents closely monitor workers' activities in collusion with oil companies.
These regions are designated "high security areas", where the free movement of people has been effectively curtailed.
The official Sudan Workers' Trade Union Federation (SWTUF) is used as part of the government's strategy to control workers in order to ensure a regular flow of oil.
Part of the revenue from this oil is ploughed back into financing the war efforts in the Darfur region.
The SWTUF has consistently supported government denials that mass murder has taken place in Darfur, where workers do not even dare to approach the SWTUF for protection.
Export Processing Zones: There is one export processing zone in Port Sudan, which is exempt from the labour laws.
There is no freedom of association for workers in the zones.
2007 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Singapore
Several restrictions in the labour law are outdated and not applied in practice; unions have asked for the law to be revised in order to reflect that.
Under a legislative amendment introduced in 2004, union members no longer have the power to accept or reject collective agreements negotiated between their representatives and the employer.
They do, however, retain the power to vote their union leadership out of office.
Private sector – limitations on the right to organise: The Constitution gives workers the right to join trade unions in the private sector, although the Trade Unions Act makes an exception for uniformed personnel.
Any group of seven or more prospective members can form a union, which is acceptable by international labour standards.
However, parliament may impose restrictions on the formation of a union on the grounds of security, public order or morality.
Formation is also subject to the approval of the Registrar of Trade Unions who has wide-ranging powers to refuse or cancel registration, particularly where a union already exists for workers in a particular occupation or industry.
Trade unions must also submit new rules, or alterations to their existing rules, to the Registrar for approval within seven days of the rule change.
The Registrar has the right to refuse the rule change if in the Registrar's discretion the rule change is either unlawful or "oppressive or unreasonable".
Public sector: The Trade Unions Act still prohibits government employees from joining trade unions, although the law gives the power to the President of Singapore to make exceptions from this provision.
The Amalgamated Union of Public Employees (AUPE) was granted such an exemption, and its scope of representation has expanded over the years to cover all public sector employees except the most senior civil servants.
In addition to AUPE, 15 other public sector unions, including public employees paid on a daily rate, are exempted.
Interference in internal trade union affairs: The Trade Unions Act restricts the right of trade unions to elect their officers, and whom they may employ.
Foreigners and those with criminal convictions may not hold union office or become employees of unions.
However, exemptions can be granted by the Minister.
Trade union members who are under 21 years of age also need prior written approval from the Minister to serve as a trustee or executive of a trade union.
Despite the fact that Singapore has an increasingly multinational work force, the Trade Unions Act bars any person "who is not a citizen of Singapore" from serving as a national or branch officer of a trade union unless prior written approval is received from the Minister.
The Act also stipulates that a foreign national cannot be hired as an employee of a trade union with prior written agreement from the Minister.
Similarly, a foreign national is forbidden to serve as a trustee of a trade union without the Minister's written permission.
Collective bargaining rights restricted: Under an amendment to the Trade Unions Act adopted on 20 April 2004, union members no longer have the power to accept or reject collective agreements negotiated between their union representatives and the employer.
The change in the law was in direct response to a dispute involving the pilots' union, Airline Pilots Association – Singapore (ALPA-S), described in the 2005 Survey.
The NTUC, however, notes that union members retain the power to vote out their leaders by secret ballot during elections at the union delegates' conference, or at an extraordinary meeting called by members.
The amendment also does not preclude union leaders from consulting their members to secure a mandate on terms of the collective agreement that are acceptable to them, at any time before the executive committee reaches agreement with the management.
Union members are also not precluded from demanding that their unions reflect their views before making any proposal or concluding a collective agreement.
Both happen in practice.
Restrictions on the right to strike: To call a strike, 50 per cent plus one of all the trade union's members must vote in favour, rather than the internationally accepted standard of over 50 per cent of those actually taking part in the vote.
Workers in "essential services" are required to give 14 days notice to an employer before taking strike action, although strikes are prohibited in some essential services such as water, gas and electricity.
Collective bargaining – court can reject agreements: Collective agreements between labour and management are renewed every two to three years, although wage increases are generally negotiated annually.
Guidelines for negotiations are recommended by the National Wages Council, which includes labour, industry and state representatives.
The aim of the council is also to provide a means by which labour can influence government policy on wage-related issues.
Collective agreements must be certified by the tripartite Industrial Arbitration Court (IAC) before they come into effect.
The IAC can refuse certification on the grounds of public interest, although in practice it has never refused to certify a collective agreement for this reason.
Certification protects union members, in that a certified agreement is legally binding to both the employers and the union.
Transfers and lay-offs are excluded from the scope of collective bargaining, although unions have the right to ask for the reasons behind the retrenchment and are not precluded from negotiating compensation for workers in such cases.
The last time it was invoked was in 2004, when the Minister of Manpower compulsorily referred a dispute between the Singapore Industrial and Service Employees Union (SISEU) and a textile company to the IAC over the management's delay in concluding a collective agreement.
Increased representation for executives: Trade unions succeeded in getting the Industrial Relations Act amended in July 2002, to allow rank-and-file unions to represent executive employees in disputes concerning dismissal, retrenchment benefits and breach of individual contract.
This amendment does not affect the right of executives to form their own unions.
With the exception of five unions representing about 2,400 workers, the rest of the country's 64 unions are affiliated with the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC), a labour congress closely linked to the ruling People's Action Party (PAP).
During the 2006 elections, a number of NTUC labour candidates ran for Parliament on the PAP ticket, and all were successfully elected.
The recently retired Secretary General of the NTUC serves as the Chairman of the PAP, a post which he also held while still active in the NTUC, and the current NTUC Secretary General and Assistant Secretary General are also members of the PAP Central Executive Committee.
The current NTUC Secretary General holds a seat in the Cabinet as a Minister in the Prime Minister's Office.
The NTUC-PAP relationship, which dates back to founding of the NTUC in 1961, is described as "symbiotic" and was formally endorsed in 1980 at the NTUC Ordinary Delegates Conference.
It was publicly reaffirmed in December 2004.
At the end of 2006, 22 newly elected MPs from the PAP were appointed as advisors to unions affiliated to the NTUC.
2009 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Sudan
There are no trade union rights in Sudan.
The national centre the SWTUF is under the control of the government.
A tripartite agreement on the abolition of censorship was negotiated by the national union of journalists but the repression of the free press intensified over the following months and a journalists' demonstration was repressed.
Single national centre, strikes banned: The 1992 Trade Union Act established a trade union monopoly controlled by the government and only the government-controlled Sudan Workers Trade Union Federation (SWTUF) can function legally.
All other unions are banned.
Labour disputes are adjudicated by the labour courts, but the Minister of Labour then refers them to compulsory arbitration.
The ILO has requested the government to amend the law to ensure that it is not compulsory.
Strike action requires government approval, which is never given and workers can be dismissed for taking illegal strike action.
Heavy government control: The government defines the scope of unions' activity, including their terms of office, elections, organisational structures and alliances – in clear contravention of international labour standards.
Trade union funds are controlled by the Auditor General.
The Labour Code stipulates that one of the trade unions' objectives should be to cooperate with government bodies and community forces to promote national independence and security and the government's international relations.
Failure to do so can obstruct union registration.
Penalties for the infringement of the trade union law are not itemised, suggesting that a sentence of six months and/or a fine is applicable in all cases.
The government has also reportedly prescribed severe penalties, including the death penalty, for violating labour decrees.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2008
Dismal rights record: Sudan is a non-democratic, authoritarian country whose human and trade union rights record is a matter of serious concern.
Human rights activists, including trade unionists and professionals, especially journalists, have been harassed, intimidated, arbitrarily arrested, detained and tortured.
Security officers usually act with impunity.
When investigating cases they are allowed to arrest, hold and torture suspects.
Trade unionists outside the pro-government trade unions live under constant fear and do not dare denounce inhuman conditions of work.
It appears that independent trade unionists are not able to participate in international trade union meetings for fear of reprisal when they return home.
The press has reported on a few strikes organised by the official unions over pay demands that in general were tolerated by the authorities.
EPZs: There is one export processing zone in Port Sudan, which is exempt from the labour laws.
League of Nations, the ILO became the first specialized agency affiliated with the UN in 1946.
Its activities include compiling labour statistics, protecting international migrants, and safeguarding trade-union rights.
Its delegates come from member governments (50%), labour (25%), and employers (25%).
About 175 countries are represented in the ILO.
It received the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1969.
Tripartism proved the heart of U.S.-ILO tensions from the early 1950s through 1977, when the United States withdrew from the ILO.
Interpreting tripartism to mean independent workers' and employers' representatives, the United States complained that Soviet, Eastern European, and some Third World union and employers' representatives were voting on government instructions.
The issue was a thorny one: the ILO Credentials Committee pointed out in 1954 that "refusing to admit … persons duly nominated by their government …on the ground that the state concerned had a socialized economy would be an unwarranted interpretation of the [ILO] Constitution.
" Moreover, observers noted that U.S. representatives had not objected to the seating of government-controlled trade unions from Franco's Spain.
International Labor Organization (ILO), specialized agency of the United Nations, with headquarters in Geneva.
It was created in 1919 by the Versailles Treaty and affiliated with the League of Nations until 1945, when it voted to sever ties with the League.
In 1946 it became the first specialized agency of the United Nations.
Although not a member of the League, the United States joined the ILO in 1934.
Through international action and by bringing together representatives of government, employers, and labor, the ILO seeks to improve labor conditions, promote a higher standard of living, and further social justice.
Promotion of international accord on such matters as regulation of hours of work, provision of adequate wages, protection of workers against occupational disease and injury, and protection of women and children and those who work outside their own countries accounts for much of its activities.
The ILO consists of a general conference of representatives of the members (four from each member state-two from the government, an employer, and a worker) that meets once a year, a governing body of 56 people (28 representing governments, 14 employers, and 14 labor) that meets three times a year, and an International Labor Office controlled by the governing body.
The ILO is financed by contributions from member states; 182 countries belong to the organization.
Protesting the political policies of the organization, the United States withdrew from the ILO between 1977 and 1980.
The ILO received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1969.
The organization puts out a number of publications containing statistics on labor and advice for workers.
Over the course of World War I, the international labor movement proposed a comprehensive program of protection for the working classes, conceived as compensation for labor's support of the war.
This program was supposed to become an international agreement after the war.
In 1919, politicians took it up in order to give social stability to the postwar order.
However, the way in which the program was instituted disappointed the high expectations of trade unions.
Politicians offered labor an institution that could attempt to achieve trade-union demands.
Despite open disappointment and sharp critique, the revived International Federation of Trade Unions (IFTU), founded in 1913, quickly adapted itself to this mechanism.
The IFTU increasingly oriented its international activities around the lobby work of the ILO.
[3]
As the war drew to a close, two competing visions for the post-war world emerged.
The first was offered by the International Federation of Trade Unions (IFTU), which called for a meeting in Bern in July 1919.
The Bern meeting would consider both the future of the IFTU and the various proposals which had been made in the previous few years.
The IFTU also proposed including delegates from the Central Powers as equals.
Samuel Gompers , president of the AFL, boycotted the meeting, wanting the Central Powers delegates in a subservient role as an admission of guilt for their countries' role in the bringing about war.
Instead, Gompers favored a meeting in Paris which would only consider President Woodrow Wilson 's Fourteen Points as a platform.
Despite the American boycott, the Bern meeting went ahead as scheduled.
In its final report, the Bern Conference demanded an end to wage labour and the establishment of socialism .
If these ends could not be immediately achieved, then an international body attached to the League of Nations should enact and enforce legislation to protect workers and trade unions.
[7]
Meanwhile, the Paris Peace Conference sought to dampen public support for communism .
Subsequently, the Allied Powers agreed that clauses should be inserted into the emerging peace treaty protecting labour unions and workers' rights, and that an international labour body be established to help guide international labour relations in the future.
The advisory Commission on International Labour Legislation was established by the Peace Conference to draft these proposals.
The Commission met for the first time on 1 February 1919, and Gompers was elected chairman.
[7]
Two competing proposals for an international body emerged during the Commission's meetings.
The British proposed establishing an international parliament to enact labour laws which each member of the League would be required to implement.
Each nation would have two delegates to the parliament, one each from labour and management.
[ citation needed ] An international labour office would collect statistics on labour issues and enforce the new international laws.
Philosophically opposed to the concept of an international parliament and convinced that international standards would lower the few protections achieved in the United States, Gompers proposed that the international labour body be authorized only to make recommendations, and that enforcement be left up to the League of Nations.
Despite vigorous opposition from the British, the American proposal was adopted.
[7]
Gompers also set the agenda for the draft charter protecting workers' rights.
The Americans made 10 proposals.
Three were adopted without change: That labour should not be treated as a commodity; that all workers had the right to a wage sufficient to live on; and that women should receive equal pay for equal work.
A proposal protecting the freedom of speech, press, assembly, and association was amended to include only freedom of association.
A proposed ban on the international shipment of goods made by children under the age of 16 was amended to ban goods made by children under the age of 14.
A proposal to require an eight-hour work day was amended to require the eight-hour work day or the 40-hour work week (an exception was made for countries where productivity was low).
Four other American proposals were rejected.
Meanwhile, international delegates proposed three additional clauses, which were adopted: One or more days for weekly rest; equality of laws for foreign workers; and regular and frequent inspection of factory conditions.
[7]
The first annual conference (referred to as the International Labour Conference , or ILC) began on 29 October 1919 in Washington DC and adopted the first six International Labour Conventions, which dealt with hours of work in industry, unemployment, maternity protection, night work for women, minimum age and night work for young persons in industry.
[8] The prominent French socialist Albert Thomas became its first Director General.
The ILO became a member of the United Nations system after the demise of the League in 1946.
Its constitution, as amended, includes the Declaration of Philadelphia (1944) on the aims and purposes of the organisation.
As of April 2009 [update] , the current director-general is Juan Somavia (since 1999).
One of the principal functions of the ILO is setting international labour standards through the adoption of conventions and recommendations covering a broad spectrum of labour-related subjects and which, together, are sometimes referred to as the International Labour Code.
The topics covered include a wide range of issues, from freedom of association to health and safety at work, working conditions in the maritime sector, night work, discrimination, child labour, and forced labour.
Adoption of a convention by the International Labour Conference allows governments to ratify it, and the convention then becomes a treaty in international law when a specified number of governments have done so.
But all adopted ILO conventions are considered international labour standards regardless of how many governments have ratified them.
The coming into force of a convention results in a legal obligation to apply its provisions by the nations that have ratified it.
Ratification of a convention is voluntary.
Conventions that have not been ratified by member states have the same legal force as do recommendations.
Governments are required to submit reports detailing their compliance with the obligations of the conventions they have ratified.
Every year the International Labour Conference's Committee on the Application of Standards examines a number of alleged breaches of international labour standards.
In 1998, the 86th International Labour Conference adopted the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.
This declaration identified four "principles" as "core" or "fundamental", asserting that all ILO member States on the basis of existing obligations as members in the Organization have an obligation to work towards fully respecting the principles embodied in the relevant (ratifiable) ILO Conventions.
The fundamental rights concern freedom of association and collective bargaining, discrimination, forced labour, and child labour.
The ILO Conventions which embody the fundamental principles have now been ratified by the overwhelming majority of ILO member states, not least because of the declaration's denomination of the principles they contain as "fundamental".
[13]
Criticism of the establishment of core or fundamental labour standards
A number of academics and activists have criticised the ILO for creating a "false division" between different international labour standards, many of which cover specific and concrete human rights topics but were excluded from the 1998 declaration, such as those on health and safety and working hours.
To add further confusion, the new core conventions are often exclusively referred to as being human rights, whereas before all international labour standards were viewed as human rights.
Philip Alston, John Norton Pomeroy Professor of Law at New York University, has written on this "narrowing" of international labour standards in the name of human rights advocacy.
[ citation needed ]
For many years, the Governing Body of the ILO had categorized the body of international labour standard conventions and recommendations.
This categorization was largely—and continues largely to be—of a technical nature, rather than a prioritization, i.e.
some standards are more important than others.
With the fall of the communism in the late 1980s perception of a need to prioritize standards grew, the view in some groups being that globalization would truly put pressure on real labour standards and the Organization truly needed now to take its mandate to improve them to heart.
The view was held also in the light of the patchy ratification of some standards' areas; although there were significant numbers of ratifications, there were also many ILO conventions which did not attract large numbers of ratifications, and these included instruments that many would see to be of very great importance.
The drive to come to a consensus on what the high priority standards would be, how they would be enunciated as such, and what mechanisms would be used to either enforce or promote them was a difficult one within the ILO, with workers', employers' and government groups taking different positions.
The term "child labour" is often defined as work that deprives children of their childhood, their potential and their dignity, and that is harmful to physical and mental development.
In its most extreme forms, child labour involves children being enslaved, separated from their families, exposed to serious hazards and illnesses and/or left to fend for themselves on the streets of large cities – often at a very early age.
Whether or not particular forms of "work" can be called "child labour" depends on the child's age, the type and hours of work performed, the conditions under which it is performed and the objectives pursued by individual countries.
The answer varies from country to country, as well as among sectors within countries.
Not all work done by children should be classified as child labour that is to be targeted for elimination.
Children’s or adolescents’ participation in work that does not affect their health and personal development or interfere with their schooling, is generally regarded as being something positive.
This includes activities such as helping their parents around the home, assisting in a family business or earning pocket money outside school hours and during school holidays.
These kinds of activities contribute to children’s development and to the welfare of their families; they provide them with skills and experience, and help to prepare them to be productive members of society during their adult life.
The ILO ’s International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC) was created in 1992 with the overall goal of the progressive elimination of child labour, which was to be achieved through strengthening the capacity of countries to deal with the problem and promoting a worldwide movement to combat child labour.
IPEC currently has operations in 88 countries, with an annual expenditure on technical cooperation projects that reached over US$74 million in 2006.
It is the largest programme of its kind globally and the biggest single operational programme of the ILO.
IPEC's work to eliminate child labour is an important facet of the ILO's Decent Work Agenda.
[14] Child labour not only prevents children from acquiring the skills and education they need for a better future, [15] it also perpetuates poverty and affects national economies through losses in competitiveness, productivity and potential income.
Withdrawing children from child labour, providing them with education and assisting their families with training and employment opportunities contribute directly to creating decent work for adults.
The ILO has always considered the fight against forced labor to be one of its main priorities.
During the interwar years, the issue was mainly considered a colonial phenomenon, and the ILO's concern was to establish minimum standards protecting the inhabitants of colonies from the worst abuses committed by economic interests.
After 1945, the goal became to set a uniform and universal standard, determined by the higher awareness gained during World War II of politically and economically motivated systems of forced labor, but debates were hampered by the Cold War and by exemptions claimed by colonial powers.
Since the 1960s, declarations of labour standards as a component of human rights have been weakened by government of postcolonial countries claiming a need to exercise extraordinary powers over labor in their role as emergency regimes promoting rapid economic development.
[16]
In June 1998 the International Labour Conference adopted a Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and its Follow-up that obligates member States to respect, promote and realize freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labour, the effective abolition of child labour, and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.

2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Switzerland
When companies are forced to downsize, workers' representatives are especially vulnerable.
Even when courts confirm anti-union dismissals, reinstatement is almost never an option.
More anti-union harassment was reported in the retail giant Migros.
Several restrictions apply to the right to strike.
Basic trade union rights are secured in law, but are not without limitations.
The Federal Constitution explicitly recognises the right of workers to form and join unions.
Although union representatives enjoy a certain degree of protection against dismissal, the Federal Court has confirmed that employers have considerable leeway due to the notion of redundancies "for economic reasons", and reinstatement is not possible.
The right to strike is limited, as all strikes must be connected to industrial relations to be legal.
The government can limit or prohibit strikes if they affect state security, external relations or the provision of vital goods and services, however there are no compensatory dispute resolution mechanisms for the workers affected.
Furthermore, if a strike is declared illegal, workers can be summarily dismissed and liable to pay compensation, as well as damages.
Penal sanctions may also be applied.
Finally, the semi-canton of Nidwald and the canton of Fribourg have introduced laws that ban strikes for the cantons' staff.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Weak dismissal protection to attract investors: A small canton of Obwalden is trying to attract businesses by promoting "employer-friendly labour law" in the press and on its official website.
Easy dismissals and the predominance of individual employment contracts over general agreements are particularly stressed.
Anti-union redundancies: The Swiss trade union confederation USS reports a number of incidents where trade union representatives were singled out for redundancies.
Examples include Ernst Gabathuler at textile machinery producer Karl Mayer AG (Benninger Guss AG before the takeover), who was employed for over 40 years and served as the workers' representative for many years; two chairmen and four members of personnel commissions at newspapers "Tagsanzeiger" and "Bund", following the restructuring of the newspapers; and Giuliano Ossola, a trade union leader who was employed for over 40 years in AGIE SA in Losone.
Another activist in a chemical company in Romandie lost his job after reporting several violations of the collective agreement.
The company, who had earlier dismissed two other members of the enterprise commission, claimed that the workers were dismissed purely for economic reasons.
One more trade union leader received formal warnings after he had informed his colleagues of forthcoming lay-offs.
No reinstatement: In March, Jean-Marc Hazard, a Unia shop steward and the president of the local personnel commission at IPN Healthcare SA in Châtel-St-Denis, Fribourg, was fired from his job.
The labour court confirmed that the dismissal was an act of anti-union discrimination.
However, since neither law, nor the relevant collective agreement in question, provided for reinstatement, Hazard was only awarded monetary compensation.
Worker almost loses his job after talking to a trade union: A spokesperson for the personnel commission at an industrial company in Romandie was suspended from work in autumn and ordered to return his keys.
The worker's "crime", according to the management, was speaking out against the company's proposed relocation and meeting with the trade union secretary.
The union launched a campaign to save the worker's job, and he remained employed at the end of the year.
Famous restaurant reported for anti-union behaviour: The trend of employers trying to use anti-trespassing laws to prevent trade unionists from entering the workplaces continued.
In October, celebrity chef Philippe Chevrier filed a complaint accusing the Unia trade union of trespassing onto his restaurant Domaine de Châteauvieux in Satigny, Geneva canton.
He also called on the police to "hunt trade unions down", and threatened union representatives who came to inform the staff and the patrons about the salaries and working conditions applicable under a new collective agreement.
The union has previously intervened in other Chevrier establishments to denounce violations of collective agreements and the labour law.
Migros get rid of shop steward: In November, Hafir Sedolli, a shop steward of the Unia trade union at the Migros distribution centre in Suhr (Aargau canton), lost his job after submitting numerous complaints pertaining to poor and unsafe working conditions.
Sedolli, who had been engaged on a temporary basis, was offered a new employment contract under the condition that he stop "helping his colleagues".
Earlier, in July, Migros had released another Unia activist, Peter Walser, from work.
Walser had been unable to work for a period of time due to a serious injury suffered in 2008, but when he regained his health, the employer dismissed him for "economic reasons".
Unia suspects that Walser's long history of trade union activities was a main factor behind this decision.
The union tried to negotiate his re-engagement to a less physically demanding position, but the outcome was not known by the end of the year.
Migros has been mentioned in several previous editions of the Survey for various anti-union incidents.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Togo
Most employers in both the public and private sectors have turned a deaf ear to trade union calls for social dialogue.
Trade union rights are not completely secured, and the right to collective bargaining is severely limited.
While the Constitution guarantees freedom of association and the right to strike, excessive restrictions still apply.
The Labour Code of 2006 extends the right to hold union office to migrant workers legally established in the country, and specifically stipulates that the consent of a spouse is not needed to join a union, a provision that facilitates the right of women to organise.
However, workers in export processing zones do not enjoy the same trade union rights as workers outside the zones.
Furthermore, the Labour Code stipulates that the dismissal of union representatives require the consent of the labour inspectorate.
Although anti-union discrimination is prohibited, there are no provisions protecting strikers against employer retaliation.
While the right to collective bargaining is recognised, it is limited to a single nationwide agreement that must be negotiated and endorsed by the government as well as trade unions and employers.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Break down of social dialogue: Since the adoption of a new labour code and a memorandum of understanding in 2006, there has been virtually no progress in social dialogue.
According to the Union of Togolese Workers Unions (ISTT), which groups together the National Workers' Confederation of Togo (CNTT), the Workers' Trade Union Confederation of Togo (CSTT), the General Union of Free Trade Unions (UGSL) and the National Union of Independent Trade Unions of Togo (UNSIT), most of the promises made by the government on workers and trade union rights have not been met.
In many sectors, workers and their organisations have complained of silence from the authorities, and even contempt for their demands.
Cases in point include the dockers at the independent port of Lomé (see article in "Violations" section), and farm agents affiliated to the National Union of Rural Managers of Togo (SYNERTO) who went on strike in March because all their efforts to negotiate the payment of their salary arrears remained in vain.
According to the UNSIT, the basic principles of social dialogue were also ignored during the restructuring of the new Phosphates Company which resulted in the dismissal of over 600 employees.
Trade union created in export processing zone: On 8 December, the Export Processing Zone Workers' Union of Togo (USYNTRAZOFE) held its founding congress at the headquarters of the Workers Trade Union Confederation of Togo (CSTT).
Organising workers in the export processing zone remained difficult, with most employers still very hostile towards trade unions.
Strike ban and broken promises at Lomé port: At the beginning of January, a wildcat strike broke out among dockers at the Lomé port.
For four years management had promised professional status and better working conditions.
The authorities banned the protest action and tried to isolate the strikers, explaining that it was not port employees but neighbourhood youth that were causing the problems.
In the weeks that followed, the Free Trade Union of Workers of the Autonomous Port of Lomé (SLTRAPAL) did reach an agreement with management, but by the end of the year the promised measures had still not been applied.
Nearly everyone agrees that job stress results from the interaction of the worker and the conditions of work.
Views differ, however, on the importance of worker characteristics versus working conditions as the primary cause of job stress.
These differing viewpoints are important because they suggest different ways to prevent stress at work.
Although the importance of individual differences cannot be ignored, scientific evidence suggests that certain working conditions are stressful to most people.
The excessive workload demands and conflicting expectations described in David's and Theresa's stories are good examples.
Such evidence argues for a greater emphasis on working conditions as the key source of job stress, and for job redesign as a primary prevention strategy.
By 1995, nearly one-half of the States allowed worker compensation claims for emotional disorders and disability due to stress on the job [note, however, that courts are reluctant to uphold claims for what can be considered ordinary working conditions or just hard work].
On the basis of experience and research, NIOSH favors the view that working conditions play a primary role in causing job stress.
However, the role of individual factors is not ignored.
According to the NIOSH view, exposure to stressful working conditions (called job stressors) can have a direct influence on worker safety and health.
But as shown below, individual and other situational factors can intervene to strengthen or weaken this influence.
Theresa's need to care for her ill mother is an increasingly common example of an individual or situational factor that may intensify the effects of stressful working conditions.
Examples of individual and situational factors that can help to reduce the effects of stressful working conditions include the following:
Although more study is needed, there is a growing concern that stressful working conditions interfere with safe work practices and set the stage for injuries at work.
Some studies suggest a relationship between stressful working conditions and these health problems.
However, more research is needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.
Some employers assume that stressful working conditions are a necessary evil-that companies must turn up the pressure on workers and set aside health concerns to remain productive and profitable in today's economy.
But research findings challenge this belief.
Studies show that stressful working conditions are actually associated with increased absenteeism, tardiness, and intentions by workers to quit their jobs-all of which have a negative effect on the bottom line.
Organizational Change.
In contrast to stress management training and EAP programs, David's company is trying to reduce job stress by bringing in a consultant to recommend ways to improve working conditions.
This approach is the most direct way to reduce stress at work.
It involves the identification of stressful aspects of work (e.g., excessive workload, conflicting expectations) and the design of strategies to reduce or eliminate the identified stressors.
The advantage of this approach is that it deals directly with the root causes of stress at work.
However, managers are sometimes uncomfortable with this approach because it can involve changes in work routines or production schedules, or changes in the organizational structure.
As a general rule, actions to reduce job stress should give top priority to organizational change to improve working conditions.
But even the most conscientious efforts to improve working conditions are unlikely to eliminate stress completely for all workers.
For this reason, a combination of organizational change and stress management is often the most useful approach for preventing stress at work.
Establish work schedules that are compatible with demands and responsibilities outside the job.
No standardized approaches or simple "how to" manuals exist for developing a stress prevention program.
Program design and appropriate solutions will be influenced by several factors-the size and complexity of the organization, available resources, and especially the unique types of stress problems faced by the organization.
In David's company, for example, the main problem is work overload.
Theresa, on the other hand, is bothered by difficult interactions with the public and an inflexible work schedule.
Evaluations should focus on the same types of information collected during the problem identification phase of the intervention, including information from employees about working conditions, levels of perceived stress, health problems, and satisfaction.
Employee perceptions are usually the most sensitive measure of stressful working conditions and often provide the first indication of intervention effectiveness.
Adding objective measures such as absenteeism and health care costs may also be useful.
However, the effects of job stress interventions on such measures tend to be less clear-cut and can take a long time to appear.
Having pinpointed these problems, the department head developed and prioritized a list of corrective measures for implementation.
Examples of these actions included (1) greater participation of employees in work scheduling to reduce unrealistic deadlines and (2) more frequent meetings between workers and managers to keep supervisors and workers updated on developing problems.
A Large Manufacturing Company.
Although no widespread signs of stress were evident at work, the corporate medical director of a large manufacturing company thought it would be useful to establish a stress prevention program as a proactive measure.
As a first step he discussed this concept with senior management and with union leaders.
Together, they decided to organize a labor-management team to develop the program.
The team comprised representatives from labor, the medical/employee assistance department, the human resources department, and an outside human resources consulting firm.
The consulting firm provided technical advice about program design, implementation, and evaluation.
Financial resources for the team and program came from senior management, who made it clear that they supported this activity.
The team designed a two-part program.
One part focused on management practices and working conditions that could lead to stress.
The second part focused on individual health and well-being.
To begin the part of the program dealing with management practices and job conditions, the team worked with the consulting firm to add new questions about job stress to the company's existing employee opinion survey.
The survey data were used by the team to identify stressful working conditions and to suggest changes at the work group and/or organizational level.
The employee health and well-being part of the program consisted of 12 weekly training sessions.
During these sessions, workers and managers learned about common sources and effects of stress at work, and about self-protection strategies such as relaxation methods and improved health behaviors.
The training sessions were offered during both work and nonwork hours.
The team followed up with quarterly surveys of working conditions and stress symptoms to closely monitor the effectiveness of this two-part program.

International Trade Union Confederation, 2008 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Togo, 20 November 2008, available at: http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/4c52ca69c.html [accessed 20 September 2010]
2008 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Togo
The 1974 Labour Code prevented foreign workers from holding leadership posts in trade unions, but under the new code migrant workers can take up such posts provided they are legally established in the country.
The new code also specifically states that a person may join a union without the express permission of their spouse, which in practice improves the right of women to join unions.
The protection of trade union representatives is strengthened through the provision that their dismissal must be approved by the labour inspector.
Nominally, the right to collective bargaining exists, but this is limited to a single nationwide agreement that must be negotiated and endorsed by representatives of the government as well as trade unions and employers.
The agreement sets nationwide wage standards for all employees in the formal economy.
Export processing zones: The law provides exemptions from some provisions of the Labour Code for companies with export processing zone (EPZ) status, notably the regulations on hiring and firing.
Employees of EPZ companies do not enjoy the same protection against anti-union discrimination as other workers.
This matter has been raised repeatedly by the ILO Committee of Experts which has highlighted the need for workers in EPZ to benefit from trade union rights.
Trade union rights in practice and Violations in 2007
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Tunisia
A number of restrictions apply despite basic trade union rights being guaranteed.
The Labour Code provides for the right to form and join trade unions, and unlike for associations, prior authorisation is not required to create a union.
However, foreign nationals need prior approval by the authorities to have access to union office.
Wages and working conditions are set in triennial negotiations between unions and employers after general guidelines are laid out through national tripartite consultations.
While the right to strike is guaranteed, all strikes must be approved by the national trade union centre the Union générale tunisienne du travail (UGTT), which unduly restricts the activities of first-level unions.
Unions must also announce the duration of the strike in advance.
Furthermore, workers having participated in an unlawful strike can face long prison sentences of between three and eight months.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Anti-union discrimination at Nestlé subsidiary: After Habib Ben Aifa was elected in June as general secretary of the Nestlé Tunisia Workers' Union (affiliated to the General Federation of Food and Tourism Workers – FGAT), the company's management sought to undermine the reputation of its employee, who had worked for the company as a sales representative for 20 years and was promoted as Head of Sales for Nestlé Nutrition.
An "inspector" was sent to the clients visited by Habib Ben Aifa asking for complaints, to no avail.
In September, the trade unionist was removed from his post on the grounds that there had been a drop in sales and was assigned to a position that required "a constant presence in the office".
The union believes the measure was a reprisal for Habib Ben Aifa's trade union role during the sale of an ice-cream factory owned by the Nestlé group and negotiated in secret.
In December staff at the factory held two strikes after being informed that their factory had been sold.
No negotiation took place however between management and the union on the future of the 105 workers and the trade union leader was not reinstated in his former post.
Trade unionists harassed at Leoni: Deep concern was expressed over violations of fundamental rights at work and the extremely high level of precarious employment (70% of the workforce) at a coordination meeting organised by the International Metalworkers Federation (IMF) on 18 and 19 November in Tunis between trade unionists from Leoni production units in Morocco and Tunisia.
According to participants, even though an international framework agreement (known as the Leoni Declaration on Social Rights) was signed by Leoni in 2003, employers showed no respect for trade union activity and union delegates faced various forms of intimidation.
At Leoni Mateur Sud, one of the group's Tunisian units, the general secretary of the workers' union, affiliated to the General Metalwork and Electronics Federation (FGME-UGTT), was facing legal proceedings purely because of his trade union activities.
Discrimination in higher education: The General Federation of Higher Education and Scientific Research (FGESRS) had still not been granted official recognition as the legitimate organisation for the sector by the authorities.
According to the FGESRS, the slowness of the courts in making a ruling was all part of a strategy by the authorities to suggest there was a crisis over trade union representation in the sector.
In practice, however, the FGESRS was often consulted and involved in social dialogue, notably in the conclusion of three collective agreements in 2009.
The FGESRS is affiliated to the Tunisian General Labour Union (UGTT).
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Turkey
There has been a worrying trend of judicial harassment of trade unions.
Union leaders and members have been arrested, sometimes by the dozens, and tried on terrorism charges, and have often spent months in jail without access to due trial.
There is a serious backlog in bringing the trade union rights-related legislation in line with EU standards and ILO Conventions, whereas a lot of progress has been achieved in other legal areas.
The right to strike and collective bargaining remain problematic, and interference in internal union affairs is varied and rife.
The laws on trade union rights are not yet in conformity with international standards.
Freedom of association is recognised for nationals and foreign workers alike, although several categories of workers in the public sector are excluded.
Trade unions must obtain permission from the authorities to organise meetings or rallies, and must allow the police to attend their events and record the proceedings.
If a union seriously contravenes the laws governing its activities, it can be forced to suspend its activities or enter into liquidation by order of an industrial tribunal.
The right to strike is also limited, as the procedures for calling a strike can last up to an inordinate three months.
The type of lawful strike action is narrowly defined, and picketing is also very restricted.
Severe penalties, including imprisonment, are possible for participation in non-authorised strikes.
Finally, the right to strike is not formally recognised in the public sector.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
No progress towards achieving full trade union rights in line with EU Standards and ILO Conventions: In its October Progress Report, the European Commission reported that "the reinstitution of 1 May as Labour and Solidarity Day after 28 years was an encouraging step".
However, it also deplored that "the current legal framework is not in line with EU Standards and ILO Conventions, in particular as regards the right to organise, the right to strike and the right to bargain collectively, for both the private and public sectors".
The ILO also called upon Turkey to adopt these reforms and suggested the organisation of a high-level bipartite mission to assist the government.
Social dialogue, at the cross-sectoral, sectoral and corporate levels, remains generally weak.
Overall, the percentage of workers benefiting from collective agreements is low.
The channels for tripartite social dialogue, in particular the Economic and Social Council, need to be strengthened.
Judicial harassment of trade unions: 2009 saw a dramatic increase of trials aimed at curtailing trade unions, a trend which started earlier but seems to be steadily on the rise.
There is a basic pattern, with unionists being treated roughly, or even mistreated, following their arrest, after which the authorities invoke some legal clause to keep the cases "confidential", so the defence lawyers have no access to their clients' files, sometimes for more than one month.
The accusations are generally related to some form of "terrorist activity", and the trials are usually marked by a lack of compliance with both national and European legal requirements.
Severe limitations to the right to strike: On 21 April, in the Yapi-Yol Sen (an affiliate of national public sector union KESK) case, the European Court of Human Rights unanimously ruled that the general ban, issued by the Turkish government, preventing public-sector employees from taking part in a one-day national strike in support of the right to a collective-bargaining agreement, was a violation of Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights on freedom of assembly and association.
Pressure to leave the union: Many workers face discrimination because of their trade union membership.
Discriminatory measures and pressure on workers to leave the union such as transfers to other workplaces, often in other cities, continued to be a problem.
On 25 November, hundreds of thousands of Turkish civil servants went on strike for the first time in ten years, to defend their right to strike.
The police used tear gas against young NGO members who were demonstrating in support of the strike in the streets of Ankara.
Prime Minister Erdogan warned the strikers that they would have to "assume the consequences" of their "illegal movement".
Trade Union of Public Employees in Health and Social Services (SES) Executive Board member arrested: On 17 April, SES Executive Board member Seher Tümer was detained in her workplace, the Ankara Zekai Tahir Burak Women's Health Training and Research Hospital, and charged with being a member of an illegal armed organisation.
She was tried a first time on 28 July, a second time on 27 August, a third time on 23 October, and a fourth time on 18 December.
When this Survey went to press, she remained in prison and her trial continued.
During her hearings, it is often stated that Seher Tümer is a trade unionist.
Trade union lay-offs: In May, the Public Services International (PSI)-affiliated municipality workers' union Genel-Is started its struggle on behalf of its 276 members, who were dismissed after Karsiyaka Municipality in Izmir started to contract out the municipal services.
Services were up till then being provided by KENT-AS.
The workers were dismissed because of a lack of resources and excess workforce, but according to PSI, the main reason for their dismissal was to outsource the services they provided.
This is indeed what happened soon after the Genel-Is members were dismissed.
After five months of seeking conciliation with the Municipal Administration, Genel-Is had still not received a response.
It therefore decided to organise a protest march from Izmir to Ankara, which was then disturbed by police interference.
Interference in internal union affairs: On 28 July, Public Services International (PSI) protested against attempts to force workers in the state enterprise of ÇAYKUR, the General Directorate of Tea Enterprises, to disaffiliate from Türk-Is and IUF-affiliate Tekgida-Is and become members of Ozgida-Is, which has close relations with the ruling party AKP.
Workers who refused to comply with the instructions to this effect were subjected to intimidation, including threats of dismissal, workplace transfer and tougher working conditions.
Along with trade union centres and the Clean Clothes Campaign, TEKSIF demanded recognition of TEKSIF as their legitimate representative trade union, and for it to be granted collective bargaining status; for management to involve TEKSIF in the ongoing discussions on the factory's restructuring; and the reinstatement, with compensations and pay-back of salary arrears for workers who were involved in court proceedings following their dismissal due to their union membership.
Public sector union KESK on trial: On 19-20 November, the trial against 31 leaders and members of KESK, the national public sector workers' union, was held with a delegation of representatives from international and European trade unions and Global Union Federations in attendance.
Twenty-two of the 31 had been detained for nearly six months.
Before the submission of the indictment, on 31 July, the defence lawyers had not had access to their files.
No health and safety or social security for shipyard workers because of lack of government backing for trade union rights: 2009 was another disastrous year for Turkey's shipyard workers.
The DISK-affiliated Harbour, Shipyard, Shipbuilding and Repair Workers' Union Limter-Is reported 15 workers died during their work on a Turkish shipyard, most of them at the notorious Tuzla shipyard, 50 km away from Istanbul.
The Limter-Is chairman Cem Dinç blamed the powerlessness of the unions on the government's indifference.
Thirteen trade union leaders arrested: On 7 December, almost the entire Executive Committee as well as some local branch office presidents of Nakliyat-Is, a trade union organising transport workers (predominantly those employed by subcontractors) affiliated to DISK, were arrested and detained.
Nakliyat-Is is one of the larger and more visible affiliates of DISK.
The union headquarters were also raided.
Upon arresting them, the police searched their houses as well as union premises in the cities of Istanbul, Konya and Gebze.
They were subsequently charged with "organising a crime syndicate in order to generate financial profit".
The defense lawyers had no access to their clients' files.
2009 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Turkey
Full trade union rights have yet to be established in Turkey.
There were improvements to the legal framework on freedom of association, but the rights to organise, to strike and to bargain collectively still need to be brought in line with EU standards and ILO conventions.
Unions are still being thwarted in their organising efforts, and/or by massive lay-offs of their members and dubious court cases and arrests of their leaders.
Strikers and peaceful demonstrators faced excessive police violence.
Very little real progress has been made yet in bringing the country's legislation on workers' and trade union rights into line with international standards.
Most changes are in draft form only, in contrast to other areas of law that have been changed with a view to Turkey's possible accession to the European Union.
Restrictions on freedom of association: The law recognises freedom of association for nationals and foreign workers alike and the right to form a trade union, but there are limitations.
Sections 3(a) and 15 of Act No.
4688, the Public Employees' Trade Unions Act (PETU), deny several categories of public servants the right to organise.
Section 3(a) only admits those who are permanently employed and have finished their trial periods.
Section 15 lists a number of employees (such as lawyers, civilian civil servants at the Ministry of National Defence and the Turkish Armed Forces, employees at penal institutions, special security personnel, public employees "in positions of trust", presidents of universities and directors of higher schools etc.
) who are prohibited from joining trade unions.
This affects more than 450,000 public employees.
In April 2007 Act No.
5620 was adopted amending section 3(a) of the Public Employees Trade Unions Act with the effect that personnel working under fixed-term contract are now entitled to join public employees unions.
This broadens the range of public employees able to join a union but in no way brings Turkish law into conformity with Convention 87 in terms of the right of workers without distinction whatsoever to form and join the organisations of their choosing.
In May 2007 Act No.
5672 was adopted amending section 14(4) of the Trade Union Act by lifting the requirement of 10 years employment in order to enjoy eligibility for trade union office.
Bill No.
2821 (the Trade Unions Act) still contains various detailed restrictions on the right to strike.
Bill no.
2822 (the Collective Agreements, Strike and Lockout Act) abolishes the obligation for workers who want to join a union to obtain a notary certificate, but not for those who want to resign from it.
They have to pay for this service.
Both bills will replace the existing legislation after having been approved by the Turkish parliament.
Until this happens, candidates for union office still need to have ten years seniority and must be Turkish citizens.
No concrete progress was made in 2008 concerning the adoption of these new laws although the government had reported to the ILO (in January 2008) that the adoption of new legislation was scheduled for the first quarter of 2008.
Unless dramatic changes are made to the existing drafts, even when the bills come into force Turkey's relevant legislation will still be in breach of ILO conventions 87 and 98.
Activities restricted: Unions must obtain official permission to organise meetings or rallies, and must allow the police to attend their events and record the proceedings.
Associations still cannot use languages other than Turkish in their official activities.
The PETU also contains detailed provisions regarding the activities and functioning of trade unions, in breach of the principles of the right to organise.
If a union seriously contravenes the laws governing its activities, it can be forced to suspend its activities or enter into liquidation on the order of a labour tribunal.
Restrictions on collective bargaining: To be recognised as a bargaining agent, a union must represent at least 50% plus one of the workers within a factory, and 10% of the workers within the relevant sector nationwide.
Only one union per enterprise, i.e.
the largest one, is authorised to conduct collective bargaining.
The ILO Committee on Freedom of Association's (CFA) recommendations that Act No.
2822 be amended to bring it in line with basic principles covering collective bargaining and the right to strike have been followed in the new Bill, but this has yet to be enacted.
Serious limitations on the right to strike: There is still no formally recognised right to strike for the public sector, despite a revision of the PETU in 2005.
The ILO has repeatedly stressed that sections 29 and 30 of Act No.
2822, concerning the right to strike, are incompatible with the Convention.
The ILO has recalled that restrictions on the right to strike in the public service depend solely on the actual tasks carried out by the public employees concerned.
These restrictions should therefore be limited to public servants who exercise authority on behalf of the state and those working in essential services in the strict sense of the term.
Solidarity strikes, general strikes, go-slows and workplace occupations continue to be banned.
Severe penalties, including imprisonment, are possible for participation in strikes.
Any strike that is not called by a trade union executive body is banned.
Strikes over the non-observance of collective labour agreements are forbidden.
Limited protection against anti-union discrimination: The minimum number of employees in a workplace needed for job security legislation to apply is 30.
As a result of subcontracting and fixed-term contracts, about 95 per cent of workplaces have fewer than 30 employees.
The fines that can be imposed on employers who do not respect trade union rights are too small to be dissuasive.
However, the Civil Code has recently been amended in order to change this.
As the ruling party has an absolute majority in the Turkish parliament, passing and enacting the new Civil Code should be a formality.
The fact that this has still not happened shows that protection against anti-union discrimination is still not a priority in Turkey.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2008
Full trade union rights not yet established: The November 2008 edition of the European Commission's Progress Report on Turkey's accession to the European Union found that the establishment of full trade union rights remained problematic.
It mentioned reports about restrictions on the exercise of existing trade union rights and dismissals due to trade union membership, as well as the need for Turkey to ensure that trade union rights are fully respected in line with EU standards and the relevant ILO conventions, in particular the rights to organise, to strike and to bargain collectively.
The percentage of the labour force covered by collective agreements remains low.
Interference in union affairs: As in previous years, the public sector federation KESK reported interference by the public authorities in its own and its affiliates' constitutions.
The Ministry of Labour and Social Security considered the use in the unions' constitutions of terms like collective bargaining or the right to strike to be violations of The Public Employees' Trade Unions Law (PETU).
Pressure to leave the union: Many workers face discrimination because of their trade union membership.
Discriminatory measures and pressure on workers to leave the union such as transfers to other workplaces, often in other cities, continued to be a problem.
The same month, the Çaykur Enterprise management, which operates 52 plants throughout the country, started forcing workers to join a union known to be close to the government.
9,500 of the 14,000 or so workers at the company were members of TEKGIDA-Is, which had been negotiating collective agreements on their behalf for over 50 years.
In blunt denial of these facts, the Ministry of Labour stripped TEKGIDA-Is of its collective bargaining rights, passing them on to the puppet union.
On 26 February, the ITUC protested to Prime Minister Erdogan about the fact that the workers at the Tuzla shipyards seeking to join a union encounter so many obstacles that just 10% of them are affiliated to a union.
This is particularly alarming since in the eight months prior to the ITUC's letter no fewer than 18 workers had died at Tuzla's shipyards as a result of dangerous working conditions and inadequate health and safety measures.
In December 2007, the Yörsan Alimentary Products Industry and Trade Company, Susurluk-Balikesir, started dismissing workers affiliated to TEKGIDA-Is.
In all it fired 403 workers.
In December 2008, a judge ruled that all the workers must be reinstated or else the company must pay 16 months' wages in severance pay to each worker.
The company chose simply to pay the compensation.
In October, the KESK-affiliated teachers' union EGITIM-Sen, which has appeared in our Survey for many consecutive years, had its website blocked by the authorities.
On 21 and 22 October, the Denizli Branch of the union was attacked by the police, which proceeded to confiscate a large number of documents.
The union was also prevented from using the clipboards intended for trade union posters and announcements in most public institutions, in particular the ministries of Justice, Labour and Social Security, Health and Education, which are held by the ruling party AKP.
Furthermore, a great number of EGITIM-Sen branch leaders and members have been transferred to other posts, and often other cities, owing to their participation in union activities.
The most blatant case of dismissal of a trade union leader took place in November, however, when Meryem Öszögüt, Head of the SES's Legal and Women's Affairs Department, was fired.
Ms. Öszögüt had spent eight months in jail simply for having attended a press conference organised by her union at which the killing of another female TU activist, Kevser Mizrak, was denounced.
She had been kept in detention based on trumped-up charges of belonging to a "terrorist organisation".
In total, 26 executive members of both the KESK headquarters as well as several of its branch offices were subjected to judicial enquiries.
Moreover, more than 600 of its members had to undergo "disciplinary enquiries" for having taken part in trade union activities.
On 19 December, the management of Sinter Metal Technologies, located in the Dudullu Organised Industrial Zone, used false pretexts to fire 38 workers involved in trade union activities.
The following Monday, a majority of the 470 workers employed there occupied the plant and demanded their reinstatement.
In response, management dismissed all but 50 workers.
On 23 December, the police removed the occupants by force.
At the Kalibre Boru Sanayi Ve.
Ticaret S.A. plant in Kocaeli, eight members of the BIRLESIK trade union were dismissed on 15 December 2007.
Later, 89 members of the union were forced to resign from it following pressure and intimidation by the management.
The situation further escalated when, on 11 January, 50 workers were left with no other option than to leave the union or lose their jobs.
Subsequently, another 39 workers were forced to resign from the union.
If an employee is in dispute with his/her employer, he can contact the staff representatives.
He can also contact the labour inspector.
If the employee considers that he is within his rights, he can contact the industrial tribunal.
All employees have the right to strike in France.
It is a constitutionally recognised and guaranteed right for all employees to stop work (go on strike) to show their disagreement or demand improvements to their working conditions.
Furthermore, in the civil service, management must be given specific notice of the strike five working days (excluding public holidays and weekends) before the date of the strike to the hierarchical authorities.
No notice is required in the private sector.
There is no legal time limit to a strike.
Workers do not need to belong to a trade union to exercise the right to strike.
Continuity of public service: The right to strike is not recognised for members of the police, prison staff, branches of the interior ministry, the judicial authorities or the army.
Other categories of staff are obliged to ensure the provision of minimum services (transport, health).
2009 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Uganda
Some rights recognised: In March 2006, four labour reform bills were passed, becoming the Employment Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Labour Union Act and the Labour Disputes Act, all of which significantly improved labour laws concerning workers' rights.
The Labour Union Act (LUA) repealed the Trade Union Act of 2000 and with it the requirements for a minimum of 1,000 employees in order to form a union and for the union to represent 51 percent of the workforce.
However, the LUA does not specifically recognise the right to collective bargaining.
The LUA bars employers from interfering in workers' right to organise and makes it a criminal offence for an employer to obstruct this right.
Anti-union discrimination by employers is prohibited, and the right to strike is recognised.
Labour disputes: The Labour Disputes (arbitration and settlement) Act, passed by Parliament in March 2006, provides for the fast resolution of labour disputes and elevates the Industrial Court to the status of the High Court.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2008
Dismissal of 116 strikers: In June, the management of the Cobalt Company Limited in Kasese sacked 116 workers who were demonstrating in front of the company's buildings after the breakdown of negotiations between the local union, affiliated to the Uganda Mines, Metal and Allied Workers' Union (UMMAWU), and the employers.
The UMMAWU also denounced the management's recruitment of Kenyans to replace the strikers and the dreadful working conditions to which these replacement workers were subjected.
No collective bargaining in the public services: No public service unions, including medical staff and teachers, were allowed to negotiate their salaries and employment terms, which were fixed de facto by the government.
Some real progress has been made over the last two years in the private sector, however, with many collective agreements being signed.
One example was the national collective agreement signed between the Uganda Hotels, Food, Tourism & Allied Workers' Union (UHFTAWU) and the Uganda Hotel Owners' Association (UHOA), which covers 150 establishments and has helped the UHFTAWU gain 20,000 new members.

2008 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Uganda
The amended labour legislation has contributed to a significant improvement in respect of trade union rights.
In most sectors, employers who had traditionally been hostile towards trade unions have agreed to recognise and negotiate with them.
In the agricultural sector, some strikers were sacked whilst others were arrested.
New laws remove barriers to organising: In March 2006 four labour reform bills were passed, namely the Employment Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Bill, the Labour Union Bill, and the Labour Dispute Bill, all of which significantly improved labour laws concerning workers' rights.
The Labour Union Act (LUA) repeals the Trade Union Act of 2000, and with it the requirement of a minimum of 1,000 employees, representing 51 percent of the workforce in order to form a union.
The LUA does not specifically recognise the right to collective bargaining.
The law bars employers from interfering in the worker's rights of association and makes it a criminal offence for an employer to obstruct this right.
Anti-union discrimination by employers is prohibited, and the right to strike is recognised.
Labour Disputes: The Labour Disputes (arbitration and settlement) Bill, passed by Parliament in March 2006, provides for the fast resolution of labour disputes and elevates the Industrial Court to the status of the High Court.
Trade union rights in practice and Violations in 2007
In a 2007 report monitoring human and trade union rights in Uganda, the ITUC maintained that despite some progress on union rights, workers were still facing harassment and employers were continuing to take reprisals against those trying to form unions and refusing to negotiate collective agreements.
That said, it should be stressed that the authorities have repeated their desire for unions to be recognised.
In the 1 May celebrations, President Museveni even threatened to prosecute employers who continued to obstruct trade unions.
Mass dismissal and arrests in two agricultural firms: In April, a strike by planters in the Sugar Corporation of Uganda (SCOUL) was broken by the management who sacked 50 workers.
At the end of 2007, they had still not been reinstated.
On 5 June, nine workers striking at Kakonde Tea Estate, in the district of Mityana, were arrested by police.
The reason for the strike was the poor working conditions.
On 18 June, five of the arrested workers were charged with alleged destruction of property and violence.
No collective bargaining in the public services: No public service unions, including medical staff and teachers, were allowed to negotiate their salaries and employment terms during the year.
The government fixed the terms and conditions for all civil service workers.
In the private sector some real progress was made, however, with many collective agreements signed, in some cases straight after a union had been recognised, as with the Ugandan subsidiary of the group G4S, which had hitherto refused any dialogue with the unions.
2007 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Ukraine
Legislation incompatible with international standards remains in place.
Although the government has made an effort to resolve some past violations, further cases of harassment, intimidation and even physical assault of trade union activists were reported.
Compulsory registration: The right to join and form trade unions is guaranteed by the constitution.
The principal law governing trade union rights is the 1999 Act on Trade Unions, their Rights and Guarantees of their Activities.
The Civil Code and the law on the state registration of legal entities and natural persons-entrepreneurs, stipulate that trade unions can only acquire legal identity after they have been registered by the State, a restriction unacceptable by international labour standards.
The registration procedure is extremely cumbersome and involves paying court fees.
An amendment that would remove the requirement for compulsory registration was rejected by Parliament in October 2005.
The government has been taking steps to bring its legislation into line with ILO standards.
Although the respective amendment should have come into force in October 2006, trade unions report that in practice trade union registration became even more complicated.
The Cabinet also gave instructions to the central executive authorities to issue systematic recommendations to their local offices to ensure that the law was applied in conformity with ILO standards.
Collective bargaining: The Law on Collective Bargaining guarantees this right.
Problems concerning wages and working conditions are supposed to be resolved by joint worker-management committees.
Registered unions with national status may participate in the national collective bargaining agreement.
However, according to the Model Statutes and Internal Rules for public limited companies, issued by the State Committee on Equities and Stock Market in April 2004, it is Works' Councils, not trade unions, that have the mandate for collective bargaining.
Yet Ukrainian legislation does not envisage the creation of Works' Councils at the workplace.
Trade unions have asked the Committee to withdraw this provision, but the Committee had still not done so by the end of 2006.
Anti-union discrimination: Anti-union discrimination is prohibited under the law.
The Criminal Code stipulates penalties for the violation of trade union rights, including fines, the loss of the right to occupy certain positions or engage in certain activities and, in some cases, even imprisonment.
However, no employer has been held liable under these provisions, even when courts have recognised cases of discrimination against trade union members.
Disputes: The law on Labour Disputes Resolution establishes an arbitration service and a national mediation and reconciliation service.
Right to strike limited: The right to strike is recognised in the constitution, provided it is to "defend economic and social interests.
" A strike can only be organised if two thirds of the workers of the enterprise vote for it, which is excessive by international standards.
The list of essential services, where strikes are prohibited, exceeds the ILO definition.
Public servants may not strike, nor may members of the judiciary, armed forces, security services or law enforcement agencies.
Workers who strike in prohibited sectors may receive prison terms of up to three years.
Federations and confederations cannot call a strike.
Trade unions want to introduce the notion of a "warning strike" of a limited duration that could be organised according to a simplified procedure.
The government does not agree to proposals to allow the unions to organise solidarity strikes.
Discrimination and interference: Trade union members are often subject to discrimination.
The Confederation of Free Trade Unions (KVPU, affiliated to the ITUC) reported that in several schools in the Lviv oblast members of their affiliate were denied bonuses or paid lower salaries, which, in one school, led to a hunger strike and the subsequent hospitalisation of some of the teachers.
Their members in the mining sector are also subject to frequent intimidation, and at least three trade unionists were dismissed from the railways.
The Federation of Trade Unions of Ukraine (FPU, affiliated to the ITUC) reported persecution for trade union activities, as a result of which trade union organisations were dissolved (cases include a tractor components plant, a convalescent home, a number of agriculture establishments and a transport service company) or lost a lot of members (for example at a steel plant and a mechanical engineering plant).
More than 20 trade union leaders have been dismissed in the course of 2006, almost half of them in healthcare institutions.
In a number of cases, trade unions tried to get the state authorities to intervene.
Although there were some reinstatements and compensations, in the majority of cases there was no state intervention or it was ineffective.
However, both KVPU and FPU reported a few incidents where trade union discrimination has been effectively addressed by the courts.
The government has been making efforts to resolve the outstanding complaints reported to the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association.
Collective bargaining: The general lack of good faith bargaining has created industrial strife.
Quite a few employers' organisations signed the National General Agreement just to be seen to be doing the right thing, but avoid sectoral collective bargaining.
Employers often refuse to enter into collective bargaining with trade unions.
According to KVPU, even a court order is not sufficient to convince the employer to enter into negotiations with a trade union.
Employer denial of union rights: Denying trade unionists access to their members' workplaces, failure to provide facilities for trade union work, including the check-off facilities, were all widespread throughout the year.
Although many cases have not been resolved yet, according to the FPU at least three companies settled outstanding union dues.
At the Radio and Television Company in Donetsk management and the trade union adopted a joint plan to eliminate violations of trade union rights.
The KVPU reports that in many cases their affiliates in the mining sector, the railway sector and its affiliated union "Defence of Justice" were not recognised by management, their activities were obstructed and they were often denied facilities or access to the enterprise.
Dismissal at Lviv Railroad: Mr. Smereka was elected chairperson of the Free Trade Union of the Uzhgorod passenger carriage section at Lviv Railroad.
He was unlawfully suspended from his duties on 20 March.
On 12 April the head of department, Mr. Oletzky, having learned about the election, said that he would now look for any way to get rid of Mr. Smereka. The trade unionist was eventually dismissed on 31 August, for alleged unauthorised absence from work.
The management took away the trade union premises, cancelled the check-off facility and threatened the members of the Free Trade Union with dismissal.
Mr. Smereka informed company central management, but received no reply.
Assaults: On 29 August Mr. God'ko, the chairman of the primary organisation of the Independent Miners' Trade Union at the joint stock company Krimsky Titan, accused the management of breaching the collective agreement and demanded that its provisions be implemented.
The next day he was beaten up by the section manager Mr. Kalinichenko, and taken to a hospital with a craniocerebral injury.
On 30 August Ms. Batog, the leader of the Free Trade Union of Education and Science in the boarding school of Sosnitsa (Chernigiv region) was beaten up by the school principal, Mr. Grishenko, after she asked the principal to explain in writing why she was refused time-off to attend a KVPU-organised roundtable on gender equality.
Ms. Batog later received an official reprimand for the same request.
Trade union premises searched: On 28 August the Chervonograd city militia searched the offices of the Independent Trade Union of Miners at three mines (Lesnaya, Zarechnaya, Viseyskaua) in the city.
The militia was acting on an order issued by the Public Prosecutor's office, although this order was issued in violation of national law.
A number of trade union documents, including the file on membership applications from 2002, were seized.
False accusations: On 26 July Mrs. Prybut, who created a trade union at the joint stock company "Dnepropetrovsk", was dismissed while on sick leave.
She was accused of the illegal transfer of company funds to her private account and the unauthorised seizure of employees' credit cards.
Some 20 employees wrote to the management to refute the accusations and to defend Mrs. Prybut. Trade unionists believe that she was dismissed because she formed a trade union.
The stress of the situation caused Mrs. Prybut to spend more than a month in a hospital.
Anti-union activities in Chernobyl: A new trade union established on 7 July at the Ekocentr scientific-industrial enterprise in the town of Chernobyl later became affiliated to the Independent Miners Trade Union.
The management did not recognise the organisation, members were intimidated and the union leader, Ms. Vasilyuk was made redundant on 5 October.
Although the Special Office of the Public Prosecutor in the Pripyat district ordered the management to cancel the redundancy, Ms. Vasilyuk was not reinstated and was ultimately banished from the enterprise on 5 December, when the company, with the help of the police, used force to evict the trade unionist from its premises.
An employee may seek to vary the contract to bring about improvements in their pay or working conditions, for instance by requesting additional holidays, or to change the conditions so that they suit him or her better, eg.
by requesting a change from full-time to part-time or vice versa.
An existing contract of employment can be varied only with the agreement of both parties.
Changes may be agreed on an individual basis or through a collective agreement (i.e.
: agreement between employer and employee or their representatives).
Alternatively, the employee may continue to work within the varied contract but under protest, making it clear that he or she does not accept the terms and is treating the change as a breach of contract and dismissal from the original contract.
In these circumstances the employee will retain the right to seek damages from the employer for a breach of contract and/or a declaration from the courts that the employer must abide by the original terms.
Subject to having the necessary qualifying service, the employee may also have the opportunity to make a claim for unfair dismissal before a tribunal.
If the employer wishes to vary the terms and conditions of employment and the employee, having been consulted, objects to the variation, then the employer may decide to terminate the contract by dismissing the employee.
As usual in the event of dismissal, the appropriate statutory or contractual notice (or pay in lieu of notice) would have to be given and any other contractual obligations relating to the termination of employment would have to be fulfilled.
Under the law the termination will be regarded as a dismissal and it will be open to all eligible employees to claim unfair dismissal before an employment tribunal – whether they refuse to accept the new contract and leave, or are dismissed under the old contract and re-engaged.
2009 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Zimbabwe
Trade union violations deteriorated further and reached an extremely violent pitch during the period of the elections.
One trade unionist was assassinated, whilst several were tortured, women activists were sexually assaulted and dozens of unionists were arrested and/or beaten.
The main union leaders have been frequently arrested and threatened.
Freedom of association – "draconian" legislation: The Labour Relations Act (LRA) gives private sector workers freedom of association, the right to elect their own representatives, and to join unions without prior authorisation.
It allows for multiple unions per industry, provided that each is registered with the Ministry of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare (MPSLSW).
The LRA gives the Registrar the power to supervise the election of officers of workers' and employers' organisations, to cancel or postpone elections and to change the venue of an election.
LRA removes trade union rights for public sector workers: The LRA excludes public sector workers from protection under labour laws by placing them under the Public Service Act, which does not provide for the right to form and belong to trade unions, collective bargaining, strikes or alternative dispute resolution mechanisms.
Collective bargaining – agreements subject to government approval: The LRA recognises the right to collective bargaining.
However, Articles 25, 79 and 81 of the Act give the Minister of Labour the power to approve collective bargaining agreements, register and publish them – contrary to promises made by the government at the International Labour Conference in June 2004 that these Articles would be repealed.
The Act also states that collective bargaining agreements should provide for measures to combat workplace violence.
The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) believes this could be used to criminalise industrial action.
Collective bargaining is not the exclusive prerogative of trade unions, as workers' committees may also bargain at company level.
The law encourages the creation of these committees in enterprises where less than 50 per cent of workers are unionised.
They exist in parallel with trade unions, hence creating the potential for employers to undermine the unions by pitting the workers' committees against them.
Their role is to negotiate on shop floor grievances, while trade unions are supposed to focus on industry level issues, notably wages, and negotiate through National Employment Councils – where they exist.
The workers' committees meet with representatives of the management to discuss workplace issues in a Works Council.
If 50 per cent or more of employees are union members, there is no parallel body, as the workers' committee becomes the trade union committee.
Barriers to the right to strike: Although the LRA recognises the right to strike, there are many procedural hurdles, such as the fact that more than 50 per cent of the employees must vote for a strike, followed by a 30-day conciliation period and possible referral to binding arbitration and then a 14-day advance notice period.
The sum effect of all these delaying tactics is that it is practically impossible to organise a legal strike.
The Act does not include provisions to prohibit employers from hiring replacement workers in the event of a strike, and also includes a section that enables employers to sue workers for liability during unlawful strikes, with penalties ranging from fines to imprisonment, or both.
Repressive legislation: The 2002 Public Order and Security Act (POSA) bans any public gatherings held without police permission.
This has been used to obstruct trade union activities and harass trade unionists.
Under the Act, people found guilty of disturbing the peace, security or public order, or of invading the rights of other people, are liable to a maximum Z$100,000 fine and/or imprisonment for up to ten years.
In addition, organisers of public gatherings must apply for permission at least four days in advance.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2008
Intimidation, interference and frequent banning or prevention of meetings: In practice, members of independent trade union organisations face harassment from government forces and the ZANU-PF militia.
It is extremely difficult for them to carry out any trade union activities.
Although the High Court ruled in April 2002 that the ZCTU does not need permission from the police to hold private meetings, the police have continued to interfere with its meetings.
In the town of Gweru (Midlands), the authorities refused the ZCTU permission to organise a march on 8 March to commemorate International Women's Day.
Some trade union offices were forced to shut down owing to threats and violence.
Splinter unions: The Zimbabwe Federation of Trade Unions (ZFTU) is a government-created labour body designed to undermine and weaken the ZCTU.
The ZFTU works closely with the ruling ZANU-PF and has created splinter unions in every sector of the economy.
In some cases ZFTU unions have coerced workers, telling them they have to join their union if they want to keep their jobs.
In 2008, as before, the ZCTU reported that some of its members were assaulted for wearing ZCTU T-shirts.
Education trade unionists targeted by the authorities and their henchmen: During the run-up to the elections, teachers and especially their trade union representatives were amongst the main victims of the security forces and gangs of young militia members and war veterans of ZANU-PF, who accused them of trying to influence the vote in the communities where they worked.
According to a report from the PTUZ, 77 teachers had to be hospitalised after being assaulted, sometimes in front of their pupils, whilst hundreds of teachers' homes were ransacked and a huge number of teachers, particularly in rural regions, took flight or emigrated.
Violence and threats against the whole free trade union movement: On 12 June, in Chegutu, Edward Dzeka, a leader of the General Agriculture and Plantation Workers' Union of Zimbabwe (GAPWUZ) and President of the local ZCTU branch, was abducted by members of the ZANU-PF militia.
He was apparently taken to a torture centre.
In Chegutu too, Rebecca Butau, a ZCTU advisor, was beaten and had to have medical attention.
Her assailants told her that they were looking for David Zunde, another GAPWUZ leader.
Forty-six members of GAPWUZ had to seek refuge in Harare after being threatened and beaten up by militiamen.
Also in June, the ZCTU President of the district of Chivhu, Tinashe Murau, was beaten up by ZANU-PF militiamen, who told him off for wearing a ZCTU tee-shirt.
His hand was fractured.
Police brutality, including against union leaders, and mass arrests throughout the country: On 3 December, 69 trade unionists were arrested during peaceful demonstrations by the ZCTU in several towns.
The demonstrations were aimed at protesting against the unprecedented financial crisis in the country by submitting petitions to the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe.
In Harare, the ZCTU General Secretary Wellington Chibebe was arrested along with nine other people whilst speaking to workers after handing over the petition.
In the capital again, ten other trade union leaders were beaten up by the police, including five women activists: Gertrude Hambira, General Secretary of the General Agricultural and Plantation Workers' Union; Angeline Chitambo, President of the Zimbabwe Energy Workers' Union; Tecla Masamba of the Communications and Allied Workers' Union of Zimbabwe; Martha Kajama of the National Engineering Workers' Union of Zimbabwe and Mirriam Katumba, Vice-Chair of the Women's Advisory Council.
The activists arrested in Harare were released on the same day, but those arrested in other towns were not released until the day after or even several days later.
2008 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Zambia
Numerous legal restrictions prevent the full exercise of trade union rights.
In addition the authorities have repeatedly displayed blatant anti-union attitudes by refusing to hold a dialogue with strikers, blocking access to the country to Zimbabwean activists and contesting the election of a women union leader.
Restrictions on the right to join and form unions: Workers have the right to join and form trade unions.
In 2005 the Home Affairs Minister announced that police officers would no longer be allowed to join a trade union.
Restrictions on the right to strike: Workers have the right to strike, except those engaged in essential services, which exceeds the ILO definition by including fire fighting, sewerage, and certain mining operations.
Workers enjoy certain legal protections against an employer's retribution for strike activities.
However, the right to strike is subject to so many procedural requirements that it is near to impossible for workers to hold a legal strike.
As a result, no legal strikes have been held in Zambia since 1994.
The Industrial and Labour Relations Act empowers a police officer to arrest someone without needing a warrant, if they are believed to be on strike in an essential service or are likely to damage property.
Police can impose a fine and up to six months' imprisonment.
The ILO has said that this punishment is disproportionate and has asked the government to amend it.
Revisions of labour laws: The government has been requested by the ILO for many years to amend the law to remove the above-mentioned restrictions and bring it into line with the principles of freedom of association.
Trade union rights in practice and Violations in 2007
Anti-union discrimination prevails: Anti-union discrimination continues to exist, against public and private sector workers, and the procedures for legal redress are often not effective due to a lack of resources.
Many officials of municipal workers' trade unions have been dismissed for union activities and the government continues to deem strikes by workers in local government to be against the public interest.
The Zambia Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) has reported a steadily deteriorating situation for basic workers' rights in the private sector, including in multinationals present in the country.
New workers in some private sector companies, particularly multinationals, are asked to sign a statement choosing a job over a union.
Those who are not prepared to give up their right to unionise are not hired.
There is particular concern about the behaviour of Chinese multinationals in the country and their failure to respect the rights of Zambian workers.
More strikes in the public services owing to the authorities' authoritarian attitudes: National and municipal authorities have been increasingly reluctant to bargain with their employees or their union.
In recent years, several major disputes have dragged on for many months, with consistent allegations of bad-faith bargaining being levelled against the authorities.
For example, on 18 June, the police in Ndola used tear gas to disperse several hundred municipal workers who had been on strike for several weeks, mainly to demand better working conditions and five months' back pay.
A few days later, the local authorities sacked 72 of the strikers.
At the end of the year, despite the intervention of the ZCTU, the sacked workers had still not been reinstated.
Also, throughout the year, teachers on strike in protest at the failure to pay their travel allowances were punished by a 50% cut in their wages.
Casualisation of labour makes organising difficult: In recent years, there have been reports of companies increasingly employing casual labour, paying workers at probationary rates despite their having been working for a number of years.
The Shoprite chain of shops has been one of the worst culprits.
Based on the law, a worker automatically becomes permanent after six months, however employers often fire workers before the six months have been completed.
Contracted workers are not entitled to any benefits.
The authorities say they are revising labour laws to curb casualisation (short-term contract work).
Government harassment of a woman union leader and interference in trade union affairs: The harassment by a government official of Joyce Nonde, General Secretary of the Zambia Union of Financial Institutions and Allied Workers (ZUFIAW), continued in 2007.
At the ZUFIAW Congress in December 2006, the Labour Commissioner, Mr. Noah Siasimuna, had refused to endorse the re-election of Ms Nonde under false pretexts.
In March 2007, the government representative ordered the dissolution of the ZUFIAW Executive Bureau, an arbitrary decision that prevented the union from conducting negotiations with the employers.
The ZUFIAW then filed legal proceedings and, on 10 August, the judges ruled in the union's favour.
In a protest letter sent to the President of Zambia a few days earlier, Union Network International (UNI), of which ZUFIAW is an affiliate, denounced the government's manoeuvres for getting rid of Joyce Nonde.
2009 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Yemen
A single trade union system is in place, and labour rights remain restricted.
The government still promises to improve the labour law to give more union freedom, but without results.
Six union members were arrested for leading a dock strike but were released after six days.
Labour law: The 2002 labour law is consistent with some of the provisions of ILO fundamental standards, but still contains several restrictions on trade union rights.
The new Labour Law, still in draft form, contains several significant changes, notably that foreign workers may join trade unions but will still not have the right to be elected to trade union office.
However, the proposed Labour Code had still not passed into law by the year's end, although on 17 March Vice President Abdu Rabu Mansor-Hadi said that the law would be changed to provide more freedom for unions and to improve workers' conditions.
Freedom of association – Single trade union system: The law recognises the right to organise, but all unions must belong to the General Federation of Worker's Trade Unions of Yemen (GFWTUY), the country's only umbrella union organisation.
The GFWTUY claims that it is not associated with the government, but it works closely with it to resolve labour disputes.
Restrictions on union membership and election of officers: Some restrictions remain in the draft, such as the exclusion of domestic workers and civil servants from joining unions.
In addition, minors aged between 16 and 18 can only join a trade union if their tutor agrees.
There is no minimum membership for unions, and workers may associate by profession or trade.
Some trade unions do exist outside the GFWTUY structures, and only the GFWTUY general assembly has the responsibility to dissolve unions.
That monopoly might be challenged when the law removes all specific references to the GFWTUY.
Right to collective bargaining – Collective agreements can be vetoed: Workers are allowed to bargain collectively, but the Ministry of Labour has the power of veto over any collective bargaining agreement.
Agreements that are "likely to cause a breach of security or to damage the economic interests of the country" can be annulled.
The ILO has requested the government amend the draft code so that the government may only refuse to register a collective agreement if it contains a procedural flaw or does not conform to minimum standards laid down by the labour legislation.
Right to strike – Strict conditions: The law recognises the right to strike but strikes may only be called after the completion of dispute settlement procedures.
Disputes may be referred to compulsory arbitration at the request of only one of the parties, in which case a strike can be suspended for 85 days.
The proposal to strike must be put to at least 60% of all workers concerned, of whom 25% must vote in favour.
The strike call must concern more than two thirds of the workforce of the employer.
Permission to strike must be obtained from the GFWTUY, and three weeks' notice must be given.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2008
Employer resistance to organising and bargaining: Many private sector employers do not allow their workers to organise, while in both the public and private sector, and often do not allow trade unions to negotiate collective agreements.
All students, including Federal Work-Study, are authorized to work a combined total from all campus employment not to exceed 42 hours per pay period when the University is in session.
The supervisor may assign fewer than 42 hours to any student.
When the University is not in session, a student may work up to 37.5 hours per week provided the student does not displace a certified civil service employee.
(For international student requirements see International Students)
A student may hold more than one student employment position.
The total hours worked in all jobs must be monitored, so as not exceed the maximum allowed by the Student Employment Regulations.
A student may not hold both a student employment position and a civil service, faculty or Administrative and Professional contract concurrently at Eastern Illinois University.
Any student who works more than 40 hours per week (Monday-Sunday) must be paid overtime per federal regulations.
Please contact the Student Payroll office for help with the overtime pay process.
Starting December 11, 2006, students will be paid by-weekly on the same schedule as the Civil Service Bi-Weekly Schedule.
Students will be paid on a delayed two-week schedule, the same as civil service bi-weekly.
A daily time record must be maintained on each student employee.
This daily record should be carefully kept and monitored by the student employee supervisor.
Student time received after the scheduled due date needs to be submitted separately and will be processed on the next available payroll.
Student payroll will be run starting January 2007 on a bi-weekly basis, following the civil service schedule.
If the student's work is not satisfactory or if other conditions make continuance inadvisable, the supervisor may request that the assignment be canceled.
If a student employee wishes to be released from a particular employment assignment, the student should notify the supervisor one week prior to the termination date to allow ample time to secure a replacement.
Upon termination of employment for any reason, the supervisor must immediately notify the Student Employment Office by completing the Student Job Termination form available on the web site.
A copy must be sent to Student Employment.
Each student employee is expected to give careful and conscientious service.
Student employees are to work 60 minutes out of each hour they are paid.
It is the supervisor's responsibility to make sure that the student employee is paid for time actually worked.
No rest time may be credited as time worked except in the case where four or more consecutive hours are worked, when the break of fifteen minutes must be credited.
Student employees are covered by the Illinois Worker's Compensation and Occupational Disease Acts and may file claims in accordance with University rules for work-related illness or injury.
A student employee is not eligible for paid vacation, paid holidays, or disability, as established by the Benefits Policy.
2009 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Vietnam
Freedom of association and trade union pluralism continued to be denied in Vietnam.
In 2008, the government enacted two Decrees that further restrict the right to strike, but this did not impede wildcat strikes.
762 wildcat strikes were reported during 2008, a 41% increase over 2007.
In Hanoi alone, nearly 20,000 labourers were involved in 46 labour disputes.
Freedom of association: Workers are not free to organise or join unions of their choosing.
The Law on Trade Unions sets out that trade unions operate "under the leadership of the Communist Party of Vietnam" (CPV).
Moreover, any union formed must be approved by and affiliate with the Vietnam General Confederation of Labour (VGCL) and operate under its umbrella.
Similarly, the Statutes of the Vietnamese Trade Unions adopted at VGCL's 9th Congress in 2003 also clearly state the trade unions are under the CPV's leadership.
The VGCL works under the close supervision and effective control of the Party and is a core member of the Vietnam Fatherland Front.
According to the Labour Code, a union must be formed by the local or industry trade unions within six months of the establishment of any new enterprise with ten employees or more.
Businesses with less than ten employees are excluded from the requirements on unionisation.
The employer is responsible for "facilitating the early establishment" of the union.
Once the union is legally formed, the law further requires the employer to recognise the union, and to "cooperate closely with it".
However, officials of the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs (MOLISA) have publicly admitted that many enterprises, particularly those owned by foreign investors, have no union presence.
According to the Law on Trade Unions, individual unions are only able to affiliate with, join, or participate in international labour bodies "in conformity with their activity objectives".
Those "objectives" are determined by the national VGCL, giving it effective power to prevent international contacts or affiliations of which it does not approve.
Right to strike: The July 2007 amendments to the Labour Law brought significant changes to legal procedures for strikes in Vietnam.
Disputes are divided into disputes over rights (compliance with the law, collective bargaining agreement, and/or work rules of the company) and disputes over interests (demands beyond what the law provides), and different procedures are set out for both.
The law also sets out an extensive process of mediation and arbitration that must be followed before a strike can legally take place.
Strikes are illegal if their origin does not arise from a collective labour dispute or if they concern issues that are outside of labour relations.
The law also states that in non- unionised enterprises "a strike must be organised and led by representatives nominated by workers".
The names of those workers representatives must be sent to the VGCL.
In 2008 the government enacted two decrees that further restrict the right to strike (Decree 11/2008/ND-CP and Decree 12/2008/ND-CP).
They regulate respectively the question of compensation for damage caused by unlawful strikes to employers and the issue of postponement or suspension of strikes.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2008
Export processing zones: Nguyen Thi Hoa, Trade Union Chairwoman of Hanoi Industrial and Export Processing Zones, reported that most enterprises did not want to set up trade unions.
Hoa noted that the Labour Code requires the establishment of trade unions if employers have not set up a Party organisation or a Communist Youth Union.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Libya
The General Trade Union Federation of Workers is an integral part of the political system, and there are no independent unions.
Migrant workers, representing an increasing part of the workforce and experiencing harsh working conditions are excluded from unions.
The Constitution does not recognise trade union rights, which are regulated by the 1970 Labour Code.
However, there is no real freedom of association, as workers are automatically members of the government-linked General Trade Union Federation of Workers (GTUFW), although they can opt out.
Independent trade unions are banned, and union membership is limited to workers of Libyan nationality.
Furthermore, Directorate General of Labour or an official from the Directorate can be present at every trade union general meeting.
Collective bargaining is seriously hampered by a provision in the Labour Code that requires the clauses of collective agreements to be in conformity with the national economic interest.
The government also has the right to set salaries unilaterally.
Section 150 of the Labour Code stipulates that all conciliation and arbitration procedures must be exhausted before a strike can be called.
Compulsory arbitration is possible at the request of one of the parties or at the discretion of the public authorities, making it possible to prohibit almost all strikes or end them quickly.
The 1975 Trade Unions Act does not sufficiently protect workers against acts of anti-union discrimination.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Role of the national centre: Despite the General Trade Union Federation of Workers' (GTUFW) claims in recent years to be more independent, it is still very much a part of the official Jamahiriya (State of the Masses) system, and as such is under government control.
The leadership of the union centre has adopted several amendments to its constitution to bring it more in line with the principles of free and democratic trade unionism, but these changes have to be submitted for "legalisation" to the "Congress of People's Committees".
The GTUFW has not reported any changes in the structures of the organisation so far.
Migrant workers excluded from unions: Libya's business boom has led to increasing reliance from the Maghreb and sub-Saharan Africa.
It is estimated that over one fifth of the workforce are expatriates.
Those from the Maghreb tend to be fairly well treated while migrant workers from sub-Saharan Africa often do menial jobs.
Egyptian workers also suffered, however.
In March, Egypt sought to repatriate 260 of its workers who had not been paid for three months and experienced very bad working conditions.
The employer had removed their passports.
Migrant workers cannot form their own unions, nor can they hold union office, and the official trade unions appear to be doing nothing to support or organise them.
2009 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Libya
While Libya has opened up its economy and restored diplomatic relations, there has been no such progress in the respect of trade union rights.
There are no independent trade unions.
All workers' organisations are closely linked to the government.
A trade union monopoly: Membership of the General Trade Union Federation of Workers (GTUFW) is automatic, although workers do have the right to opt out.
Independent trade unions are banned.
Candidates for trade union office must be of Libyan nationality.
Collective bargaining – highly restricted: The Labour Code requires that clauses of collective agreements be in conformity with the national economic interest.
That provision allows the government to preclude any demand it regards as incompatible with its economic and social preferences.
Right to strike – compulsory arbitration: According to section 150 of the Labour Code the exhaustion of all conciliation and arbitration procedures is the only condition for a lawful strike and section 176 imposes a penalty of imprisonment or a fine against anyone who contravenes this provision.
Collective disputes must be referred to compulsory arbitration at the request of one of the parties or at the discretion of the public authorities, the outcome of which is binding on both parties.
As the ILO has noted, this system makes it possible to prohibit virtually all strikes or end them quickly.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2008
Role of the national centre: The GTUFW has recently claimed to have become independent and has changed its name, dropping the word "producers" as a means of stressing that it is a workers' union.
The leadership of the union centre has adopted several amendments to its constitution to bring it more in line with the principles of free and democratic trade unionism.
But these changes have to be submitted for "legalisation" to the next "Congress of People's Committees".
So far, the structures of the organisation have not changed, neither have most of its leaders.
The Constitution contains some declarations of principles (e.g.
Sect. 1 - Italy is a democratic Republic founded on labour; Sect.
4: the Republic recognises to every citizen the right to work; Sect.
35 - the Republic protects work in all its forms and applications), and some more effective rules, largely employed in case-law: Sect.
36 - on fair pay, the maximum working hours, the weekly and annual paid vacation (see number 5, 6 and 11); Sect.
37 - on the protection of women and of minors on the job (see number 7 and 9); Sect.
38 - on the social insurance for old age, illness, invalidity, industrial diseases and accidents, etc.
; Sect.
39 - on Freedom of Association (see number 12); Sect.
40 - on the right to strike (see number 15).
The contract of employment is considered indefinite except in cases specified by legislation (Act 230 of 1962).
Fixed-term contracts of employment are permitted to the extent that they are justified on grounds such as seasonal work, replacement of employees on sick leave or maternity leave, and extraordinary and occasional work.
Pursuant to Act 56 of 1987, collective agreements may authorize other cases of recourse to fixed-term contracts of employment.
Until recently, a breach of legislative requirements on fixed-term contracts led to employers typically being required to employ the employee indefinitely.
Recently, however, Act 196 of 1997 (the “Treu Act”) has limited this sanction to ongoing violations.
If employment continues for ten days beyond the expiry date, the employer is liable to pay 20 per cent extra remuneration; for 20 days beyond the end date, 40 per cent extra; and only then is the contract required to be converted into an indefinite one.
A fixed-term contract will also be deemed to be indefinite if the employee is rehired in less than either ten or 20 days from its expiry (ten days for contracts of less than six months' duration; 20 days for contracts of six months' duration or more).
Suspension of the contract of employment is pemitted under Sect.
2110 of the Civil Code in case of industrial accident, illness, maternity (two months before and three months after childbirth); in these cases the employee is entitled to an allowance from social insurance (paid in advance by the employer) which covers about 2/3 of the salary; collective agreements frequently provide for the employer paying the remaining 1/3 of the employee’s salary.
The Civil Code provides that each contracting party (the employer and the employee) of a contract of indefinite duration can terminate it, provided the notice period is respected (Sect.
2118), or without any notice in case of just cause (sec 2119).
However, Act 604 of 1966 (which implemented a collective agreement on the issue) introduced limitations on the employer’s freedom to dismiss, for companies employing more than 35 people.
This was then extended to all organizations regardless of size by Act 108 in 1990; now termination by the employer is only possible for a "justified reason” and provided that the notice period is respected; or without notice for a just cause (Sect.
2119, CC).
Collective agreements frequently list the grounds for dismissal.
Dismissals on the grounds of political opinion, trade union membership, sex, race, language or religious affiliation are null and void.
Furthermore, members of workers' committees may not be dismissed or transferred for one year following the cessation of their duties on the committee without the authorization of the relevant regional trade union organization (Sect.
3, Act 108; this law also applies to directors and domestic workers).
Dismissal on the grounds of pregnancy, if the dismissal takes place between the conception and the end of the female employee's statutory period of absence on confinement leave or unpaid leave, until the child reaches one year of age, is also expressly prohibited.
Dismissal on the grounds of marriage is also prohibited.
Protection against unfair dismissal of managerial employees is regulated by collective agreements.
Where there are fewer than 15 employees in a unit or fewer than 60 employees in total, the employee unfairly dismissed has no right to reinstatement, but is entitled to compensation ranging from 2,5 to six times the monthly pay.
Act 223/1991, on collective dismissals, provides for special procedures of information and bargaining with unions before terminating contracts, and special indemnities for the employees that are to be made redundant, according to EU directives.
Collective agreements determine the normal weekly working time (never more than 40 hours).
Work performed in excess of 40 hours a week is overtime.
Different overtime limits can be fixed by collective agreements.
In principle, overtime should be occasional or due to exceptional reasons which cannot be met by the hiring of new workers.
Act 196/1997 requires a specific authorisation by the Department of Labour (Inspectorate) for work exceeding 48 hours a week (in practice: more than 8 hours overtime).
Under Act 623, of 1923, still in force, overtime must be paid with an increase of not less than 10 per cent over the regular rate.
However, the italian courts have ruled that such provision applies to all the remuneration an employee earns from his/her employer (i.e.
basic pay plus any bonus such as cost of living bonus, allowances for night work or shif work, etc), so that in practice overtime pay is worth about 30 per cent over the basic rate.
Many collective agreements provide that overtime pay will be not less than 30 per cent, but they can also provide – and they often do – that this bonus will be calculated on the basis of a narrower definition that the above.
There are also extra costs (e.g.
a higher rate of compulsory contributions to The Public Fund for Unemployment Benefits).
Special pay increases are fixed by collective agreements for overtime worked on Sundays, on other holidays and night work.
Night work has been recently settled by Act no.25 of 1999.
For part-time work, the distribution of the working hours is established by an individually written contract which cannot be changed by the employer.
Act 63/2000 gives the employer the right to change the part-time scheduled hours, under two conditions: the prior consent of the worker, and the increase in hourly wage.
Special provisions in favour of student workers are established by Sect.
10 of Act 300/1970 (Statute of the Workers’ Rights).
Workers attending regular courses, in State or publicly certified schools or in schools issuing officially recognised study certificates, are entitled to a working schedule which favours attending courses and the preparation of examinations.
Student workers are not obliged to work overtime or on Sundays and must be given paid days off work to take exams.
All workers have the right to annual paid leave (art.
36 of the Constitution).
The Civil Code provides for a statutory minimum leave of eight days, for domestic workers only.
Minimum leave of all other workers is determined by collective agreements, which generally provide for paid annual leave of not less than four weeks per year.
Some agreements foresee additional vacation on the ground of seniority.
During their vacation, employees receive normal pay, excluding only indemnities connected to the actual work.
Italy has ratified the ILO Holidays with Pay Convention (Revised), 1970 (no.
132) which provides for a minimum leave of not less than three working weeks for one year of service.
During compulsory maternity leave, the mother is entitled to 80% of her regular pay from Social Security and the period is counted as actual work time.
Collective agreements usually oblige the employer to make up the difference to the regular wage.
In case of sickness, the employee’s protection has been remarkably improved, mainly through collective bargaining.
During sickness, suspension of the contract, with job protection, lasts for periods usually determined by collective agreements, according to the employee’s seniority.
The average period is about one year.
During this time, the worker is fully paid (by the employer or by the Social Security).
Beyond this period an employee is usually entitled, under collective agreements, to a further period of unpaid leave.
Now Act 53/2000 accords great consideration to general and professional education.
Workers with a minimum of 5 years seniority can request a maximum of 11 months unpaid leave (all together or at intervals) to attend schools, universities or other educational training.
Many benefits promoting the education of workers have been introduced since 1973 by national collective agreements.
Workers are entitled to a number of paid hours off work (150 in general, up to a maximum of 250 for employees who have to obtain a basic level of compulsory education) to attend, at public or certified schools, courses related or not to their professional activity.
In case of military service, job security and seniority are guaranteed to all workers (Sect.
2111 of Civil Code, Act no.653/1940, 303/1946, 370/1955).
The Civil Service of Conscientious Objectors and Service in Underdeveloped Countries have the same consideration (Acts no.230/1998 and no.49/1987).
Act no.
300/70 accords (unpaid) leave for persons elected to public office (during the time of mandate) or for elected trade union representatives.
Act 300/70 also guarantees to trade union officials and union members different possibilities of leave, with or without pay, in order to fulfil their duties, tasks or rights.
Special leave (with or without pay) or unpaid absences are granted to workers by collective agreements on the occasion of important family events.
Act no.
977 of 1967 and no.345/1999 introduced a special regulation to protect the work of minors, such as special medical certificates guaranteeing their physical fitness for work, periodical medical check-ups, limits on working hours, prohibition of night work and so on.
Act no.148/2000 is intended to meet the obligations arising out of the ILO Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (no.182) in the fight against the exploitation of minors.
It also draw guidance from ILO Recommendation no.190/1999, which supplements the said Convention.
A law on sexual harassment at work does not exist; however, there is case law on unfair dismissal on this ground.
Legal procedure for individual labour disputes is applied to combat discrimination at work.
There is a fast track procedure on following grounds: (i) discrimination for union views (Sect.
28 Workers’ statute); (ii) race, ethnical, national or religious discrimination (Sect.
44 of Act286 of 1998); (iii) men-women discrimination at work (Sect.
15 of Act 903 of 1977).
For other kinds of discrimination there is the general fast track procedure (Sect.
700 of Civil procedure Code).
Pursuant to Sect.
2 of Act 297 of 29 May 1982, the Guarantee Fund also protects severance pay (trattamento di fine rapporto), in case it cannot be paid due to the insolvency of the employer.
Sect.
39 of the Constitution regulates trade unions and specifies that only the registered ones can obtain legal status and can make collective agreements valid erga omnes (for all employers and employees).
This provision, however, has not been enforced because a bill regulating the registration of unions has never been adopted.
Therefore, in Italy unions do not need any recognition and can organize themselves without any pre-established legal model.
They can conclude collective agreements, which are legally enforceable under civil law rules, i.e.
on the assumption that the parties to a collective agreement have stipulated on behalf of their respective membership.
Usually the employers abide by the collective agreements concluded by the most important unions and employers’ associations and pay wages in accordance with them for all their employees.
The Workers’ Statute (Sect.
14) recognises freedom of association and freedom of trade union activity at the workplace.
The same rights are also guaranteed to public employees (except military staff, who have representatives not belonging to the unions).
Act 121, 1 April 1981 also guarantees union freedom and activity to the Italian Police (Polizia di Stato, that is not a military force), except for the right to strike and union activities which may compromise public security (Sect.
84).
For workers the most frequent pattern is the industry-wide union, which has local, provincial, regional and national organs (vertical organization).
The national unions join together in trade union federations (horizontal organization).
Sect.
28 of Act 300 of 1970 (Workers’ statute) provides that whenever the employer indulges in behaviour designed to hinder or limit the exercise of freedom of association and trade union activities, or the right to strike, the local organs of the relevant national trade unions can demand that the judge (within whose jurisdiction the anti-union conduct complained against has taken place) order the employer to cease and desist from his illegal conduct and to redress any grievances or obviate the effects thereof.
Under case law a number of employers’ actions have been deemed to be anti-union behaviour, and are therefore prohibited.
These include dismissal of workers on strike; the hiring of third parties to replace workers on strike; retaliation against workers that undertake legal strike action; failure to inform the unions on issues regulated by collective agreements; direct bargaining with the workers, thus bypassing the unions; to infringement of union rights fixed by law, e.g.. not to reserve a room for union meetings inside the factory; not to permit the union to have a board to post union information, to interfere with union proselytism, etc.
Unions can freely negotiate collective agreements at provincial, regional and national levels.
Trade union security clauses such as union shop, closed shop, etc.
are unknown in the Italian legal system.
Under Art.
17 of Law 936/86, which reorganized the National Council of Economy and Labour (CNEL), collective agreements and accords must be registered with the CNEL within 30 days after they have been concluded.
The so-called economic accords are agreements that cover some categories of self-employed (i.e.
commercial agents, some doctors working for the National Health Service, etc, also known as lavoratori parasubordinati).
Collective bargaining can regulate all aspects of the employer-employee relationship, except those that are regulated by law (for the effects of collective agreements see no.
12).
Most categories of workers (roughly 95 per cent) in Italy are covered by a collective agreement.
However this does not mean that collective agreeements actually cover 95 per cent of all contracts of employment, because they are binding only on the parties that have signed the agreement, as well as the employers and workers legally represented by such parties under Civil Code rules (i.e.
they apply only to members of the organizations that have signed the agreement).
So it would be necessary to verify if at least the employer is a member of the employers’ association that has signed the agreement, in which case the agreement would cover his/her employees, whether or not they are members of the relevant trade union.
Should the employer not be a member of such an association the agreement would not be binding on him or her.
Nonetheless, the judges can take into account the minimum wage that has been fixed in the agreement as a parameter in view of fixing a fair salary pursuant to Sect.
36 of the Constitution (see Section 11, above).
The judge may therefore rule that an employee not covered by an agreement shall, however, be paid at a rate not less than the one established under the agreement that applies to his/her category and industry.
The unions joining the biggest federations have a very important function in collective bargaining in public employment and receive protection in view of trade union activity at the plant level.
The Workers’ Statute, 1970, regulates plant level union activity.
The Statute has been an important means of support of the unions at plant level.
For public employees there is a different system of workers’ representation (Act 29, 3 February 1993), but the rights are the same.
Collective agreements regulate election and duration of office of workers’ representatives.
A change of the representatives follows after the signing of a new collective agreement.
Collective agreements do not recognise for the workers’ representatives any co-determination right, but only the right to be informed and consulted on the most important decisions of the company.
The Italian Constitution recognises the right to strike, which must be exercised within the limits fixed by the law (Art.
40). However, only one law exists, that regulates the right to strike, and that is for the public essential services (Act 146, 12 June 1990); thereforethere is a large freedom to strike.
Some workers cannot strike (military personnel and policemen); for others the right to strike has some limits (for example seamen cannot strike during navigation).
A specific regulation does not exist in the Italian legal system.
When the employer locks out the workers he/she breaches the contract of employment and must pay wages.
However, under case law there is not a breach when the lockout is a consequence of a strike by the workers and the industry is unable to continue production.
There is not a procedure for collective disputes, except for the possibility, introduced by the Act 80 of 1998, of asking the Supreme Court for the immediate interpretation of a collective agreement signed by the union of civil servants.
The bibliography on labour law issues is boundless.
Just a few names of the main general textbooks on labour law and on labour procedure:

2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Moldova
The government has still not properly addressed the violations of trade union rights reported to the ILO five years ago.
Law enforcement remains a problem, and the legal framework is not conducive to trade union activities.
A number of limitations on trade union rights apply despite initial guarantees.
The right to form or join a trade union is recognised by the Constitution, and the Trade Union Law of 2000 provides for trade union independence.
However, unions may only acquire legal status if they are members of a national branch organisation or national cross-sectoral trade union organisation, which unduly limits the freedom of the unions.
The Labour Code also stipulates that either party to a collective dispute may submit the conflict to judicial tribunals for settlement if negotiations fail or if the party disagrees with the decision of the reconciliation commission.
The right to strike is prohibited for government workers and workers in essential services, the list of which exceeds the ILO definition.
Furthermore, workers having participated in an unlawful strike may face serious fines and even imprisonment.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Issues in the ILO complaint still unresolved: In 2004, repeated and systematic interference by the public authorities led a number of Moldovan trade unions, supported by the ICFTU (predecessor of the ITUC), the IUF and PSI to lodge a formal complaint to the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association (CFA).
In June, after having examined the case a number of times, the CFA noted with regret that the government had still failed to address the issues mentioned in the complaint.
The alleged acts of interference by the government and employers in trade unions' internal affairs had not been investigated and the legislation had not been amended.
In addition, a new case concerning the refusal to register a trade union in 2007-2008 had not been properly addressed.
Weak enforcement: Law enforcement remains weak.
Neither labour inspectorates nor prosecutors' offices have proved effective in monitoring and enforcing respect for labour standards, especially the right to organise.
The sources of labour law in Senegal are found, first and foremost, in the Labour Code (LC) of 1997, [1] regulations and case law.
A number of regulations have also been elaborated by the social partners and these consist of collective agreements, the most important of which is the National Inter-occupational Collective Agreement of Senegal (CCNI) signed on 27 May 1982.
According to sec.
L-2 of the LC, persons appointed to permanent posts in the public administrative service are excluded from the scope of the LC.
The dismissal of public employees is regulated through the provisions of the General Civil Service Statute (particularly with regard to the exercise of due process of law before a disciplinary commission).
Termination of a contract of employment in the maritime services is also governed by separate specific rules (Merchant Marine Code, 1962, secs.
166 to 169).
[2]
A contract of specified duration is a contract whose duration is stipulated in advance according to the will of the parties (sec.
L-41, LC).
A contract of employment made for the execution of a specified piece of work or the conclusion of an operation whose duration cannot be assessed beforehand is to be treated as a contract of specified duration.
A contract whose termination is subject to a future but certain event, the date of which is not exactly known, is also to be treated as a contract of specified duration.
A fixed-term contract must be done in writing and its duration cannot exceed two years.
The employer has to notify the labour inspector about all fixed-term contracts concluded for more than three months (sec.
L-44, LC).
Every unjustified dismissal is considered as a wrongful dismissal (sec.
L-56, LC).
“Valid reason” is a concept defined neither by legislation nor by collective agreements.
This concept encompasses a large number of instances.
In spite of the diversity of facts and situations which may constitute a valid reason for termination, they may be grouped in two categories depending on whether they relate to the worker or the interests of the enterprise.
[3] Most cases fall within the category of reasons relating to the worker, which includes all conduct or inaptitude by the worker incompatible with the continuation of employment.
Under certain time limitations, medically certified physical incapacity of the worker is a valid reason for dismissal, provided that dismissal is not carried out during the period when employment has been suspended because of illness.
The same is true for professional inaptitude which may manifest itself in various forms: poor service, poor management, low output, professional incapacity, non-performance of a job in the agreed period, among others.
Dismissal without legitimate reasons and dismissal on account of the worker’s opinions, trade union activity or membership or non-membership of a particular trade union (sec.
L-56, LC), or on the grounds of sex, race or religion are examples of wrongful dismissal.
Absence from work for up to six months, which is justified by incapacity due to an illness other than an occupational disease or accident, is not a valid reason for termination.
If the worker’s illness requires long-term treatment, taking into account the seniority of the worker in the enterprise, the six-month time limit will be extended to eight months for workers with seven to 15 years’ seniority, and to ten months for workers with a longer period of service with the enterprise (sec.
19, CCNI).
Under sec.
L-143 of the LC, an employer may not dismiss a pregnant woman during the period of interruption of work due to pregnancy.
Similarly, a worker who has suffered an occupational accident who cannot be reassigned in the enterprise may only be dismissed with the prior agreement of the labour inspector (sec.
118, Social Security Code).
Without this authorization, such dismissal is wrongful.
Any individual or collective dismissal that an employer intends to order because of economic reasons or an internal reorganization constitutes dismissal for economic reasons (sec.
L-60, LC).
The duration of the notice period is fixed by collective agreement or, in absence of such agreement, by decree.
For executives and similar personnel: three months; for monthly paid white-collar workers, blue-collar workers and permanent hourly, daily or weekly paid staff: between eight days and one month, depending on the length of service (sec.
23, CCNI).
With the aim of avoiding economic dismissals, the employer must consult the staff representatives to ascertain whether other possibilities, such as a reduction in working hours, work on a rota system, part-time work, training or reassignment of staff may avert the proposed dismissals A summary of this meeting must be transmitted by the employer within eight days to the labour inspector, who will have 15 days following the submission of the communication from the employer to possibly exercise his or her good offices (sec.
L-60, LC).
In the case of workers with equal aptitude, the workers with the greatest seniority will be kept on staff.
Seniority in the enterprise is increased, for the purpose of establishing the order of dismissals, by one year in the case of married workers and by one year for each dependent child in accordance with legislation on family allowances.
The LC leaves it open for contracts and collective agreements to determine whether provisions for compensation for dismissal are due or not.
There are, therefore, provisions for compensation in most collective agreements, particularly in the CCNI.
The above description of the regime for such compensation refers mainly to the CCNI (sec.
30, CCNI).
For each year of service in the enterprise, severance pay is represented by a percentage (from 25 to 40% depending on the worker’s length of service) of the average overall wages for the last 12 months of service prior to the date of dismissal.
These overall wages include all payments representing allowances, except for those allowances corresponding to the reimbursement of travel expenses.
The principle of judicial monitoring of termination of employment contracts appears in sec.
L-56 of the LC, in accordance with which, the labour courts are competent to examine the causes and circumstances of the breach of the contract.
The burden of proving the existence of a valid reason for dismissal rests on the employer.
Neither cancellation of the decision to terminate employment, nor reinstatement of the worker are avenues of redress for wrongful dismissal, which may give rise only to the payment of damages.
When the responsibility for the termination lies with the employer, damages will be assessed with due regard to custom, the nature of the services contracted for, the worker’s length of service, his or her age and any vested rights.
Commissions, bonuses or various advantages and allowances, in so far as they do not constitute repayment for expenses, are also taken into account for the calculation for damages.
The judgement must expressly mention the alleged reason given by the employer and substantiate the assessment of damages (sec.
L-56, LC).
Termination of employment of a worker without respect of the legal procedure (a written notification stating the reasons of the dismissal) is not deemed wrongful.
However, the labour court may allow the worker concerned a compensation for the procedural irregularity (sec.
L-51, LC).
The labour court can order the reinstatement of a workers’ representative dismissed without authorisation by the labour inspector (sec.
L-217, LC).
In the event of litigation, individual labour disputes concerning termination of an employment contract for economic reasons must be examined as a matter of priority by the labour courts (sec.
L-62, LC).
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Syria
After an easing of restrictions for a few years, the authorities have clamped down again, arresting and imprisoning any opposition members.
The right to strike is severely restricted, and workers are threatened with harsh punishment if they strike.
Migrant workers are abused as they lack legal protection.
Only one trade union federation is allowed.
The Constitution provides for freedom of association, but workers may not establish unions independent of the government.
In addition, all workers' organisations must belong to the General Federation of Trade Unions (GFTU), which is strictly controlled by the ruling party.
The GFTU also controls most aspects of union activities; it determines which sectors or occupations can have a union, and sets the procedures for the use of trade union funds.
It also has the power to disband the executive committee of any union.
Foreign workers may join the union of their profession, however they may not be elected to trade union office.
Furthermore, while strikes are not prohibited, the right to strike is severely restricted by the threat of punishment and fines.
Strikes involving more than 20 workers in certain sectors, including transport and telecommunications, are punishable by fines and even prison sentences.
The same applies to any strike action which takes place on public highways or in public places, or that involves the occupation of premises.
Civil servants who disrupt the operation of public services risk losing their civil rights.
Finally, forced labour can be imposed on anyone who causes "prejudice to the general production plan".
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Background: After a period of slight lifting of restrictions on individual activity when President Bashar al-Assad came to power in 2000, the government has clamped down once again, and there have been increased incidents of arrests, trials and imprisonment of political and human rights activists.
In December 2009, research showed that child labour was rising, with some 10% of school-aged Iraqi refugee children in Syria found to be working to supplement family savings; indeed, child labour is the main source of sustenance among refugees in Syria, who are not legally entitled to work.
Right to strike hardly exercised: Workers generally dare not exercise the right to strike, given the potential heavy penalties and the reintroduction of repression of any activity deemed to be critical of the government.
However, in November 2009, some 30,000 United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East employees from the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon went on strike for a brief period.
Workers and union members reported they were striking in order to improve services offered to Palestinian refugees, bring an end to service conditions for employees, and increase the number of employees in the region.
GFTU position: Despite its close links with the ruling Ba'ath Party, the General Federation of Trade Unions (GFTU) rejects the suggestion that the political leadership imposes control over the organisation.
The GFTU states that workers at all levels elect their leadership freely and will vote out of office those who do not adequately represent their interests.
It also states that the reason for the existence of a single trade union system is that workers themselves reject union diversity because it harms their unity and their interests.
The government has used precisely the same argument in its reports to the ILO.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Iran
Hundreds of workers were arrested for supporting the right to organise and for participating in legitimate trade union activities.
At least seven trade unionists remain in jail, including a teacher who was sentenced to death in 2008.
Seven new prison sentences were issued and fair trial standards compromised, although in some cases unionists were able to appeal their cases successfully.
Trade union rights are severely limited, and strikes are prohibited.
While the Constitution protects freedom of association, genuine trade union rights are not guaranteed in law.
The Labour Code stipulates that either an Islamic Labour Council or a guild society can be established at a workplace, however the law strongly favours the former.
The Labour Councils are linked to the Workers' House, the "official" workers' organisation set up and backed up by the authorities and employers.
No other form of representation is allowed where a council has been established, although workers are allowed to collect signatures for dismissing an Islamic Labour Council.
Prior authorisation is required for organising, as well as for concluding collective agreements.
Furthermore, the labour laws do not apply in workshops with less than five workers and in the export processing zones.
Although strikes are not allowed, workers in the private sector can down tools as long as they remain at the workplace or operate a go-slow.
All work stoppages in the public sector are prohibited.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Teachers' associations banned: In 2007, teachers' protests led to harassment, detention and incarceration of labour activists: many suffered pay cuts, were dismissed and forced to retire.
The Interior Ministry has since issued a ban on all teachers' associations.
Even though the associations were never formally dissolved by court, intelligence officers insist that the associations were liquidated by the government and that the teachers should resign from them.
Several teacher associations have been crushed by the intelligence service, but some, such as the associations in Tehran, Esfahan and Kermanshah, remain active.
Union meetings are either dispersed or supervised by officers from the intelligence service.
Haft Tapeh Sugar Company Union – pressure intensifies: Union representatives of the Haft Tapeh Sugar Cane Plantation and Industry complex trade union were persecuted because of their legitimate trade union activities, such as reclaiming wage arrears and defending basic rights at work.
Five leaders, Jalil Ahmadi, Feridoun Nikoufard, Ghorban Alipour, Mohammed Heydari Mehr and union president Ali Nejati, received prison sentences, while union communications officer Reza Rakhshan is still waiting for his verdict.
As reported in the 2009 edition of the Survey, the Haft Tapeh trade union is one of very few genuine trade unions that appear to have the right to exist within the national legal framework.
Nevertheless, the five leaders were charged with creating an illegal union.
In an attempt to create a situation where the union would be unequivocally outlawed, the authorities ordered Islamic Labour Council elections at the company for 24 February.
When the elections failed due to the low turn-out, new arrests and judicial persecutions followed.
The original five leaders (Nejati, Ahmadi, Alipour, Heydari Mehr, Nikoufard) were to be tried on two sets of charges: one in connection with a strike in 2007, and the other in connection with creating a union in 2008.
Initially sentenced to a year in prison on 14 April, all but Nejati were cleared of all charges pertaining to 2008 on appeal on 25 September.
However, all five were convicted in connection with the 2007 strike, and on 11 October, the court of Dezful sentenced most activists to six months' immediate imprisonment and six months sentences suspended over five years – during which time they are barred from all trade union activity.
Osanloo and Madadi still in prison: Mansour Osanloo, the president of the Tehran and Suburbs Bus Company (Sherkat-e Vahed) trade union, and Ebrahim Madadi, the vice-president of the same union, are still in jail, serving prison sentences of five and three and a half years respectively for their defence of workers' rights.
Osanloo has been incarcerated since July 2007 and is currently placed in the Reja'I Shahr prison, west of Tehran, among prisoners who have been convicted of crimes such as murder.
His health is continuously deteriorating due to pre-existing medical problems as well as new ones gained through the way he was treated in prison.
Despite the prison doctor's referral, Osanloo was denied a temporary leave to get necessary medical help.
Osanloo also ultimately lost his job when the Tehran Revolutionary Court confirmed his dismissal on 21 October.
Madadi has been in jail since December 2008.
Both men have been maltreated while in custody and both are recognised as prisoners of conscience by Amnesty International.
Kamangar still at risk of being executed: Farzad Kamangar, a Kurdish teacher, human rights activist and a trade union member who had been sentenced to death for "endangering national security" in a five-minute long secret trial in 2008, is still kept in the Evin prison and risks execution at any time.
His lawyer alleges that Kamangar suffered torture and ill-treatment while in custody.
In December, Kamangar's file was reported to be examined once again by the Supreme Court; however, later reports said that the authorities were threatening his imminent execution, along with other Kurdish activists.
Hashem Khastar, a retired teacher and a trade union activist, is also serving a two-year prison term for "acting against the security of the country".
Jafar Ebrahimi-Azandaryani, a human rights activist and a member of the teacher association who was arrested on 10 June for trying to organise a union meeting, was released on bail in December.
Both activists reportedly suffered from very serious health conditions, and both were denied appropriate medical treatment.
Ali Reza Saghafi, a journalist known for his incisive commentaries on trade union rights and chairman of the Centre for Defending Workers' Rights, was also arrested along with his son Mohsen.
They were released on bail from Evin prison after one month, but were to report to the Revolutionary Court for hearings in November.
Saghafi had also been arrested for one day in 2008, and was re-arrested at the end of the year.
Trade union lawyer interrogated: Mohammad Olyaeifard, the lawyer who represented the Haft Tapeh trade union, was summoned to court on charges of "propaganda against the state", "slandering the judiciary" and "publication of lies and agitating public opinion" on 18 November.
Shortly before receiving the summon, Olyaeifard had written to the ITUC and IUF asking for international solidarity.
There were reports of other persecutions against Olyaeifard, allegedly connected to him representing other civil activists.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Laos
Trade union rights are severely curtailed.
The law bans strikes and stoppages.
The only trade union organisation in Laos is still closely linked to the Lao People's Revolutionary Party (LPRP), the only political party recognised in law.
Nine people were arrested after a rural workers' demonstration.
While the Constitution guarantees some freedoms to Lao citizens, there is little room for trade union activities in the law.
All unions must belong to the Lao Federation of Trade Unions (LFTU), which is directly controlled by the ruling party.
The law further prohibits union members from organising an "illegal group, gathering, or protest and acts" that are found to damage the union as well as the interest of the state or the collective interest.
Those who join an organisation that encourages protests, demonstrations and actions that might cause "turmoil or social instability" face imprisonment of between one and five years.
Furthermore, the law meticulously regulates the internal organisation of unions, and stipulates that only Lao nationals can become union members.
While protection against anti-union dismissals is secured, the law does not protect workers against retaliation short of dismissal, e.g.
transfers for "disciplinary reasons".
In the Labour Law, unions are only acknowledged in the context of identification of workers for redundancy, the possibility to negotiate on wage levels and to assist individual workers in settling disputes.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Union and party hand in glove: Given that the Lao Federation of Trade Unions (LFTU) and the Lao People's Revolutionary Party (LPRP) are so closely knit, the LFTU effectively enables the party to control the workers.
The LFTU frequently speaks of its role as a collaborator with government in ensuring enforcement of the Labour Law so that the rights of both workers and employers are protected and as a formulator of future labour laws.
The LFTU's quasi-state function means it has a dual role as both as a controller as well as a potential protector of labour.
No collective bargaining in practice: The government unilaterally sets wages for government employees, and its decision is not subject to collective bargaining.
For private sector employees, the Labour Law gives unions the right to negotiate pay levels with the employer.
However, there is no provision in the labour law that compels an employer to bargain or penalises the failure of an employer to bargain.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Tanzania
There was good news and bad news in Tanzania.
Teachers were caned for asking for a pay rise, while at the docks and on the railways employers tried to ignore their unions.
In the catering industry, however, the government urged employers to allow union representation, while a court upheld the unfair dismissal claim of the mineworkers' union (on behalf of 700 members).
Overall, the legal environment is not conducive to trade unions, especially in Zanzibar, where all strikes are prohibited.
Despite some constitutional guarantees, many excessive restrictions apply.
The government retains control over many trade union activities, and can even suspend a union if it considers that public security or public order are endangered.
While the right to collective bargaining is recognised, all collective agreements must be submitted to the Industrial Court for approval and may be refused if they do not conform to the government's economic policy.
Furthermore, workers in public services are not allowed to bargain collectively.
Strike action is permitted as a measure of last resort, but all strikes are subject to a compulsory 30-day mediation period.
The list of services where strikes are prohibited is extensive, and covers almost 50% of all services.
Strikes in other sectors may be either temporarily or permanently banned after a complicated investigation process.
Picketing is not allowed.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Ministry calls for union rights in hotel industry: The Minister for Natural Resources and Tourism, Ms Shamsa Mwangunga, met hotel owners in the Northern Zone on 27 February to discuss reports of the denial of basic workers' rights.
Parliamentarians had complained that workers were harassed, paid low salaries and had no trade union branches.
The Minister directed the employers to allow their employees open trade union branches at their work places.
Some hotel owners and leaders of trade unions had already agreed to end their ongoing dispute by ensuring that every hotel opens a trade union branch and also employees that are given contracts.
The hotel owners at the meeting promised to resolve the matter within six months.
Management ignores agreement with union: Dockworkers at the Dar es Salaam port ceased unloading containers on 27 July to protest at their employer's failure to respect an agreement on bonus payments with the union.
Tanzania International Container Terminal Services (Ticts) had agreed with the Dock Workers' Union to pay workers Sh150,000 bonus every month should workers manage to offload more than 20 containers per hour on average, but in June they were paid Sh75,000 even though they exceeded that average.
The union said workers were also paid only half the agreed overtime allowance.
Another case of the employer ignoring union rights occurred during a dispute at Tanzania Railways.
Workers downed tools on 4 August after management at Dar es Salaam failed to attend a scheduled meeting with the union to discuss the payment of salary arrears.
2008 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Laos
Laos passed a Law on Lao Trade Unions which came into force on 1 February 2008, supplementing a new Labour Law passed in 2006.
But despite these new laws, there was little change for workers in Laos, one of the few remaining communist states in the world.
The only trade union organisation in the country is closely linked to the sole legal political party in the country.
Work stoppages and strikes are forbidden in law, and there were no reports of labour unrest during the year.
A systematic lack of enforcement of the labour law leaves Lao workers unable to exercise their rights in practice.
No freedom of association: The Constitution of Laos provides that Lao citizens have the right and freedom of speech, press and assembly, and have the right to set up associations and to stage demonstrations which are not contrary to the laws (which makes independent trade unions unconstitutional).
Trade union pluralism does not exist in Laos.
The new 2007 Law on Lao Trade Unions defines "Lao trade unions" as a "mass organisation in the political system of the democratic centralism unified leadership under the Lao People's Revolution Party.
" Labour unions must be affiliated with the government sanctioned Lao Federation of Trade Unions (LFTU), which operates as a mass organisation directly controlled by the sole political party, the LPRP.
Article 5 of the 2007 Trade Union Law explicitly states that the trade union must "organise and conduct its activities in line with the ... unified leadership under the Lao Revolution Party.
"
The Trade Union Law defines the status, rights and obligations, as well as the system, structure and financial management of trade unions at all levels in Laos thus failing to accord the right to determine their own structure, rules, administration or activities.
Article 11 of the law recognises the right of the union to sign collective employment contracts but there is no compulsion on the part of the employer to bargain.
The 2007 Trade Union Act defines membership of the trade union as workers from various sectors who have been "registered as members of trade unions in the Party's and State's organs, the Lao Front for National Construction, mass organisations and labour units".
Civil servants employed in state administrative organs, and employees in state enterprises still constitute the overwhelming majority of the LFTU's members.
The Lao PDR Constitution actually says that the LFTU's role is "to unite and mobilise all ... people for taking part in the tasks of national defence and construction.
" Article 30 of the 2007 Trade Union Law prohibits union members from organising an "illegal group, gathering, or protest and acts" that are found to damage not only the union but also the interests of the State or the collective interest.
At the very end of 2006 a new labour Law came into force which repealed the labour law of 1994.
Civil servants in "state administrative and technical services, national defence, public order, and mass organisations" are excluded from the remit of the 2006 Labour Law.
Article 5 of the Labour Law requires that "trade unions shall be established in each labour unit" and at those workplaces where a union is not formed, there shall be a "workers' representative.
" The law is silent on how "workers' representatives" will be selected.
However, in the past, representatives of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare (MOLSW) have acknowledged to the National Assembly that there is no punishment under law for employers who fail to comply with this requirement.
Within the wide array of issues covered by the Labour Law, the role of trade unions is acknowledged only in the context of identification of workers for redundancy, the possibility to negotiate on wage levels and to assist individual workers in the settlement of labour disputes over rights.
The Labour Law does not compel an employer to negotiate on any issue with a trade union and does not recognise any form of collective labour dispute.
Unlike the 1994 Labour Law, the new Act does not explicitly recognise the right of workers to organise.
Yet workers are protected from termination of employment for reasons related to trade union membership and activities.
Strikes effectively outlawed by the Labour Law: The 2006 Labour Law strictly prohibits workers or their representatives from calling a work stoppage in a wide variety of situations.
Neither workers and their representatives, nor employers, can call for a work stoppage in cases of disputes regarding implementation of the labour law or regulations, or a dispute over workers benefits under the law.
Work stoppages are also forbidden if the matter is the subject of negotiations in which both sides have agreed to participate, or while the dispute is under consideration by the labour authorities, or in the labour disputes settlement procedure of the People's Court.
Persons or organisations involved either "directly or indirectly" in a stoppage, or who "verbally or materially incites workers" to conduct a stoppage "thus causing damage ... or social disorder" are punishable under law.
The dispute resolution system set out in the 2006 Labour Law fails to provide any avenue for a legal strike to be called.
Articles 62 and 63 of the law set out that "disputes over rights" [involving complaints about failure to follow the Labour Law, internal work rules, signed contracts and other legal instruments] must be resolved through negotiations, Government-directed mediation, and finally, as a last step, referral to the People's Court for a decision.
Article 64 requires that "disputes over interests" [involving claims for benefits and rights above what the law provides] must be settled by negotiations, then referral to the Labour Dispute Arbitration Committee, and finally by decision in the People's Court.
The right to strike is further restricted by dissuasive penalties.
The penal code provides for between one and five years' imprisonment for those who join an organisation that encourages protests, demonstrations and other actions that might cause "turmoil or social instability.
"
Election of union leaders, but restrictions on their removal: Article 13 of the 2007 Trade Union Law requires that the leaders be elected by the members in union's general meetings.
However, Article 32 of the same law sets out a broad restriction that prohibits any organisation or individual from seeking to dismiss members of the trade union executive committee at any level without the prior consent of the leaders at the higher level of the union.
Legal protection against termination for union activities: According to Article 30 of the 2006 Labour Law, employers may not fire employees "who are preparing to be on the trade union committee or a workers' representative to be approved by the workers.
" The same Article makes it unlawful to terminate an employee for filing a complaint against the employer, engaging with officials seeking to apply the labour law, or being involved in a labour dispute at the worksite.
Article 31 of the 2007 Trade Union Law prohibits employers from dismissing any member of the trade union "without reasons and improperly by the law.
"
However, protections against retaliation short of termination are lacking.
For example, Article 34 of the 2006 Labour Law allows an employer to transfer workers for "disciplinary reasons" or "as a means of preventing possible damage to its activities.
"
Legal authority for unions to bargain but no requirement to compel employers to negotiate: Both the 2006 Labour Law and the 2007 Trade Union Law recognise the role of trade unions to negotiate with employers over wages and conditions of work.
Article 11 of the Trade Union Law explicitly states that unions are to represent workers in signing collective contracts, and can request employers to revise or end unfair labour contracts.
Union membership subject to nationality and age restrictions: Article 20 of the Trade Union Law restricts trade union membership to those having Lao nationality.
Children as young as 14 years old are permitted to legally work in Laos, but the same section of the law also sets an age requirement that workers must be over 18 years old to join the union.
Trade union rights in practice and Violations in 2007
Union and party hand in glove: Given the fact that the LFTU and LPRP are so closely knit, it effectively operates as a labour front for the ruling party.
Indeed, the President and two vice Presidents of the LFTU are accorded status equal to a Minister and vice Ministers in the government, and the LFTU presidium and top officers are all paid salaries by the government.
In public statements, the LFTU frequently speaks of its role as a collaborator with Government in ensuring enforcement of the Labour Law so that the rights of both workers and employers are protected and as a formulator of future labour laws.
The LFTU's quasi-state function means it exists in a dual role as both as a controller as well as a potential protector of labour.
No effective collective bargaining: The government unilaterally sets wages for government employees and this determination is not subject to collective bargaining.
For private sector employees, the Labour Law gives unions the right to negotiate pay levels with the employer.
However, there is no provision in the labour law that compels an employer to bargain or penalises the failure of an employer to bargain.
Lack of law enforcement: Observers from international NGOs and embassies based in Vientiane indicate that non-enforcement of the labour law by the MOLSW, particularly in dealings with joint ventures in the private sector, is the norm.
The 2007 Trade Union Law provides the authority to unions at each level to set up "inspection committees" composed of the President, Vice-President and other union leaders.
The functions of these committees include monitoring and oversight of labour that may ultimately supplement state inspection functions.
2009 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Tanzania
It is very difficult for trade unions to negotiate with their employers.
Strike calls remain numerous but the procedure is very complex and strikes are often declared illegal.
In Zanzibar, strikes are illegal and banned.
Freedom of organisation – excessive power of Registrar: The Trade Unions Act allows workers to form trade unions but contains several restrictions on trade union rights.
Trade unions must have at least 20 members to register, and unions must register within six months of being established.
Those that fail to do so are subject to (unspecified) sanctions.
A union has to provide the Registrar with annual lists of its membership and financial audits, and the Registrar can suspend a union if public security or public order are endangered.
Trade union affiliation to other organisations can be annulled if it was obtained without government approval or if the union is considered to be an organisation whose remit is broader than just employer-worker relations.
The government also prescribes the terms of office of trade unionists.
Failure to comply with government requirements is subject to fines and/or imprisonment.
In any given trade union, only one union leader may be employed full-time to carry out trade union functions; all others must work full-time in the enterprise or industrial sector in which they have been elected.
Collective bargaining: Collective bargaining is recognised in law.
Collective agreements must be submitted to the Industrial Court for approval and may be refused registration if they do not conform to the government's economic policy.
Right to strike: In 2007 the amended Employment and Labour Relations Act (Code of Good Practice Rules) was adopted, establishing fuller guidelines for the implementation of the main ELRA.
Strike action is permissible as a measure of last resort in the case of conflicts of interest, whilst rights-based disputes are referred to the labour court.
There is a prior 30-day mediation period and requirement for a strike ballot before lawful strike action may be taken.
Secondary strike action is allowed provided that the primary action is lawful, there is a relationship between the primary and secondary employer and the secondary action is proportional; a 14-day notice period is required for secondary action.
Greater restrictions in Zanzibar: There are far greater restrictions on trade union rights in Zanzibar than in the rest of the country.
There is a minimum membership requirement of 50 people before registration can go ahead and the Registrar has considerable powers to restrict registration, for example, if s/he does not agree with the union's provisions.
Trade union officers must have a sufficiently high literacy level.
The High Court can interfere in trade union affairs by appointing the Registrar to act as a trade union liquidator.
There are three export processing zones (EPZ) on the mainland, where working conditions are comparable to those outside the zones.
There are two EPZs on Zanzibar, where there were unconfirmed reports of trade union rights violations.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2008
Background: The Labour Ministry has called on employers to take a more conciliatory attitude towards trade unions, to allow them to organise and to bargain with them in order to maintain social peace, to avoid unnecessary strikes, improve working conditions and to aim at more ambitious economic objectives.
The same ministry has announced its intention of undertaking a "massive hunt of migrant workers employed in many sectors without following the legal procedures".
Privatisation – workers' rights ignored: Employees in the privatised industries are denied freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, despite very difficult working conditions.
There are reports that some employers were deducting union dues from workers' pay but were remitting them to the unions only after long delays if at all.
Difficulties in organising legal strikes: Workers tend to stage illegal wildcat strikes and walkouts because of the lengthy and cumbersome requirements for calling a legal strike.
In October, after endless and fruitless legal proceedings by the Tanzania Teachers Union (TTU), teachers began selective strikes.
On 14 October, after a court judgement banning them, angry teachers turned against TTU leaders.
In the banking sector, a strike by 2,000 employees of the National Microfinance Bank was also judged illegal by a labour tribunal.
The employer immediately threatened the leaders of the Tanzania Union of Industrial and Commercial Workers (RUICO) with disciplinary measures against strikers refusing to return to work.
Railway workers fared no better in the courts.
Fish processing plant workers locked in during an official visit: According to certain sources, workers in a fish processing factory in the Mara region were locked in a room by their employer during a visit by Vice-President Ali Mohamed Shein.
This was done to prevent workers taking advantage of the arrival of this senior government official to formulate their complaints.
They work in a rough environment and suffer frequent aggressive behaviour from their superiors.
Most have been working for years on temporary contracts and are threatened with dismissal if they complain to management.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Guinea Bissau
The authorities failed to keep their promises to pay the salary arrears of civil servants.
It is virtually impossible to exercise trade union rights.
In addition, freedom of association is guaranteed in the labour law, which is not sufficiently encompassing.
Restrictions exist despite fundamental trade rights being granted; all workers have the right to form and join trade unions.
However, the provisions in the Labour Code on anti-union discrimination are inadequate as they only protect trade union delegates and are not coupled with sufficiently dissuasive sanctions.
Most wages are established in bilateral negotiations between workers and employers, but a tripartite National Council for Social Consultation holds consultations on wages and employment legislation.
Finally, workers have the right to strike and are protected by law from employer retaliation.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Payment of salary arrears repeatedly postponed: In February, the country's two national trade union centres, the General Confederation of Independent Trade Unions (CGSI) and the National Workers' Union of Guinea Bissau (UNTG), protested against accusations by Finance Minister, José Maria Vaz, of widespread corruption among civil servants; the unions believed these accusations were a means of trying to justify salary arrears in the public sector.
Throughout the year the unions had campaigned for the arrears to be paid, in vain, despite promises by the authorities.
On 29 December, the government once again promised to pay all arrears.
In 2008, there were attempts to destabilise the unions who were on general strike over the same demand.
In one incident the UNTG's premises were ransacked.
The Federal Employees’ Compensation Act is the law governing the payment of workers’ compensation benefits to civilian employees of the United States who suffer a disability due to personal injury (including occupational disease) sustained while in the performance of duty.
Damage to or destruction of medical braces, artificial limbs, and other prosthetic devices incidental to a job-related personal injury is also compensable.
The act also provides for the payment of benefits to dependents if a job-related injury or disease causes the employee’s death.
An occupational disease is defined as a condition produced in the work environment over a period longer than one workday or shift.
It may result from systemic infection, repeated stress or strain, exposure to toxins, poisons, fumes, or other continuing conditions of the work environment.
A recurrence of an employment-related disability is covered if an injured employee is again disabled as a result of the original injury or occupational disease.
Monetary compensation is based on the monthly pay of the injured employee at the time of the injury, at the time the disability begins, or at the time a compensable disability recurs (if such recurrence begins more than six months after the injured employee resumes regular full-time employment with the United States), whichever is greater.
FECA compensation generally is calculated at two-thirds of the employee’s monthly pay rate if he or she has no dependents, or three-fourths of the pay rate if married or with one or more dependents.
Locality, night differential, hazard, premium, holiday, and Sunday pay are included in determining the pay rate on which compensation is based, although overtime pay is not.
The maximum payment per month cannot exceed three-fourths of the highest rate of basic pay provided for grade GS-15.
Minimum monthly compensation for total disability cannot be less than three-fourths of the lowest basic monthly pay level for GS-2, or the employee’s monthly pay, whichever is less, except for increases resulting from cost-of-living adjustments.
Compensation for disability cannot be paid concurrently with an annuity (including a lump-sum payment) under the Civil Service Retirement System, or the Federal Employees’ Retirement System, or any other law providing retirement benefits in lieu of those provided under the CSRS or FERS.
An employee entitled to both types of benefits (i.e., retirement and FECA) must make an election; however, a new election may be made whenever it is to the employee’s advantage to do so.
(For more detail, see the section below entitled “Disability Retirement vs. FECA Benefits.”)
Full recovery is determined by a decision to terminate FECA benefits on the basis that the employee is medically able to resume regular employment.
For purposes of restoration rights, a position with the same seniority, status, and pay means a position that is equivalent to the former one in terms of pay, grade, type of appointment, tenure, work schedule, and, where applicable, seniority.
An employee’s standing in the organization, such as first or second supervisory level, is not a factor.
Physically disqualified.
FECA compensationers who are medically unable to return to their former occupation, but who are able to do other work, are considered to be physically disqualified.
Such individuals are entitled, within one year of the date compensation begins, to be placed in a position that most closely approximates the seniority, status, and pay to which they otherwise would be entitled, depending on the circumstances of the case.
These restoration rights are agency-wide.
After one year, such individuals are entitled to the same restoration rights as individuals who fall into the “partially recovered” category described below.
Physically disqualified employees typically have a permanent medical condition, such as the loss of an arm, that disqualifies them for their old or an equivalent position and makes it unlikely that they will ever be able to return to the former position.
Parental leave will be increased from three to four months and will apply to all employees regardless of the type of contract, according to an agreement signed yesterday (18 June) by social partners in presence of Vladimír Špidla, EU commissioner for employment, social affairs and equal opportunities.
A first agreement on parental leave was signed between social partners in December 1995, establishing a three-month period.
To redress the situation, the EU executive and social partners agreed to review the framework agreement.
After two stages of consultation , which started in 2006 between the European Commission and social partners on reconciling private, working and family life, the parties worked for six months on amending the text.
The new Framework Agreement on family leave was signed yesterday (18 June) by the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC), BusinessEurope, the European Centre of Employers and Enterprises providing Public Services (CEEP) and the European Association of Craft, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (UEAPME).
It is the first time that European social partners have agreed to revise a pre-existing Framework Agreement.
The new agreement increases parental leave from three to four months for each parent.
Moreover, one of the four months shall be non-transferrable between the parents "to encourage a more equal take-up of leave by both parents," says the text.
"At the end of parental leave, workers shall have the right to return to the same job or, if that is not possible, to an equivalent or similar job consistent with their employment contract or employment relationship," reads the text.
Moreover, parents returning to work have the opportunity to request a change to their working conditions (working hours, for example).
Parents on leave will continue receiving a salary according to their national social security system, social partners said.
BusinessEurope Secretary-General Philippe de Buck insisted that social partners had worked on the agreement "in an autonomous way".
"The flexibility at the end of the parental leave to be in contact again with work life is very important for employees, but also for employers who have to organise their human resources," he said.
"We have made a significant step with this revision agreement," said John Monks, general Secretary of the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC).
"For many workers in Europe, it's very difficult to conciliate private and working life.
The initial agreement in 1995 brought a lot of countries up to better level, and this revision takes forward the issue of the extra month," he said.
2008 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Costa Rica
The government of Oscar Arias and its followers deployed a strategy of trade union persecution in response to the growing opposition to government policy, the attempts to defend the role of the state and the international campaigns in support of workers' rights.
Two union leaders received dismissal orders, three faced administrative and judicial proceedings, and 18 were indicted.
The Labour Ministry, far from protecting union rights, joined in with the violations.
Lack of protection: Only a very limited group of trade union representatives are legally protected from dismissal and in practice this protection is not respected.
In fact, some new grounds for dismissal have been introduced that solely apply to union leaders.
There is no legal obligation on an employer to prove grounds for the dismissal of workers covered by trade union protection.
The law sets out complicated administrative procedures by the national labour inspectorate (DNIT) for the reinstatement of trade unionists claiming unfair dismissal.
Even where a violation is clearly proven, the DNIT has to submit the case to the courts to initiate a legal process which may take many years.
There are no guarantees of reparation for any damages caused, and there is no legal mechanism to oblige an employer to comply with a court order to reinstate a worker.
A bill to reform the current lengthy and inefficient labour dispute resolution process is being studied by a tripartite commission within the Supreme Labour Council.
No constitutional protection of freedom of association: The Constitutional Court has denied recourse to legal protection for defending the right of freedom of association, unlike other human rights, where such protection is provided.
Combined with the sluggishness and inefficiency of the normal workings of the Labour Inspectorate and the law courts, this is contributing to the total lack of protection of trade union rights.
Foreigners excluded: Foreigners are prohibited from holding office or positions of authority in trade unions.
Again, the government has repeatedly ignored ILO recommendations to change this.
Right to strike: Strikes are officially permitted in the private sector, provided that strict requirements are met.
At least 60 per cent of workers at the enterprise must support the strike, which is considered excessive by ILO standards, and to prove this, the unions have to name those workers who support the strike.
Furthermore, lengthy legal procedures must be followed.
Collective bargaining: Employers are obliged to enter into collective bargaining with a trade union that requests it and represents over one-third of the workforce.
Notwithstanding, collective bargaining is at risk of disappearing completely.
A Constitutional Court ruling of May 2000 declared collective agreements concluded in certain public bodies, institutions and enterprises unconstitutional.
This is creating a case law that totally contradicts the protective principles that existed previously.
The notion of a collective agreement being an instrument that enables the unions to obtain benefits over and above the legal minimum standards, and that contributes to better income distribution, is being totally undermined, having been classed as a means of securing unreasonable and disproportionate privileges.
Collective bargaining is no longer seen as a means of settling disputes, challenging the autonomy of the parties and the legitimacy of collective agreements.
Trade union rights in practice and Violations in 2007
Background: The social movement opposed to the Free Trade Agreement with the United States gathered increasing force at the beginning of 2007, compelling the government to hold a national referendum (the first ever) to decide on the ratification of the FTA.
An intense and imbalanced campaign followed, pitting the business sector and the government, backed by the solidarista movement and the mass media, against trade unions, social organisations and citizens grouped within the patriotic committees set up to oppose the agreement.
The campaign ended on 7 October with a disputed victory for the Yes vote, amid widespread reports of irregularities and illegalities in the process along with denunciations of manipulation by the government and business leaders and the intervention of the United States government.
Consistent failure to protect trade union rights: The effective exercise of trade union rights is made very difficult in practice.
There are virtually no trade unions in the private sector and there are constant complaints to the Ministry of Labour regarding anti-union harassment in the few private companies where unions still exist.
At the same time, the public sector unions, which form the vast majority, are being subjected to a continuous de-recognition campaign by the government, the chambers of commerce and the media.
As a result, the duty of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to promote freedom of association is being totally ignored, and there are no instruments available for doing so.
The MTSS is, meanwhile, publishing literature promoting "direct arrangements" as an "alternative" to trade unions, limiting the authority and autonomy of workers and undermining internationally recognised trade union instruments such as the right to strike and collective bargaining.
The state is thus becoming complicit in these violations and is, in fact, directly responsible for the lack of protection of trade union rights.
Freedom to dismiss and labour flexibility used as anti-union strategies: The trade unions have long complained that private sector employers refuse to recognise them and dismiss workers who try to join a trade union.
Legally recognised freedom of dismissal facilitates these anti-union strategies and is becoming the main barrier to the formation of new trade unions in the private sector, as any attempt to organise carries the risk of instant dismissal.
Likewise, "flexible" contracts are impeding any attempts to organise.
The job instability arising from short-term contracts or subcontracting fuel workers' fear of losing their jobs and thus constitute a means of repressing the right to form and join unions.
Complicit public authorities and slow and inefficient procedures: Such conduct, although illegal, is tolerated by the authorities and sanctions are too mild to be dissuasive.
Given the complex procedures involved, seeking the reinstatement of workers who have been unfairly dismissed takes an average of three years, which is long enough to remove a trade union.
The DNIT usually takes longer than the maximum two month period foreseen by the Constitutional Court to certify a violation.
When a case eventually goes to trial, it can take several years to reach a verdict.
"Solidarismo" and other anti-union forces: One of the biggest obstacles to the free exercise of trade union rights is the deeply embedded culture of "solidarismo".
The promoters of "solidarismo", who were responsible for dismantling the unions in the banana plantations in the 1980s, are still the principal opponents of trade unions today.
According to reports from trade unionists, the workers' "representatives" from the Escuela Social (Labour School) "Juan XXIII" are company advisors and the leaders of anti-union campaigns within the banana and pineapple plantations.
Unlike the supporters of trade unions, who are impeded every day in their efforts to organise themselves, the representatives from Juan XXIII enjoy the full support of companies in carrying out their anti-union activities.
The high profile of the solidaristas in defending the corporate stance during the FTA Referendum provides confirmation of which side these organisations are on and whose interests they represent.
Statistics show that "solidarismo" associations have consistently outnumbered trade unions by four to one, particularly in the private sector.
The encouragement of "permanent workers' committees", which are legally recognised, is another pro-employer strategy to neutralise the work of unions.
Collective bargaining virtually non-existent in the private sector: In the private sector, collective bargaining has been reduced to a bare minimum.
Instead of collective agreements, there are many "direct arrangements" with non-unionised workers who are grouped together in "permanent workers' committees".
The legislation allows for the creation of such committees provided there is a minimum of three workers, whereas for a union to be recognised as a bargaining unit, it must have a minimum of 12 workers and represent at least one third of employees.
The unions have been critical of the fact that, in most cases, these "direct arrangements" are promoted by employers and the Labour Ministry to prevent the formation of unions and encourage "solidarismo".
Pineapple plantations expand and follow the anti-union model of the banana plantations: The pineapple companies have not only occupied some of the old banana plantations and sell to the same multinational trading companies, but are also reproducing the same anti-union tactics.
Harassment of trade unions is a daily occurrence in the pineapple plantations, which circulate "blacklists" to avoid recruiting people who have joined trade unions.
Dismissals are constant and unionised workers are discriminated against and subjected to strong pressure and threats or offered incentives to leave the union.
Promotions and benefits are commonly offered to anti-unionists in both sectors.
Export processing zones (EPZs) with virtually no unions: The few unionised workers in EPZs also face harassment and unfair dismissal.
The number of labour inspectors remains far too low to deal with the amount of unfair dismissals among this large segment of the workforce.
Organising is virtually non-existent in the zones.
Trade unionists face legal proceedings following complaint filed with ILO: On 15 January, Mario Núñez Arias, a member of parliament from the Libertarian Movement, filed a complaint against a large group of trade unionists to the Attorney General, accusing them of having committed the "crime" of denouncing the Costa Rican government to the ILO for violation of freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining.
The complaint includes a call for the dismissal of the trade union leaders, who work for government institutions.
Gilbert Brown, Rodrigo Aguilar and Tyronne Esna, leaders of the CTRN trade union centre (Central de Trabajadores Rerum Novarum), along with Dennis Cabezas and Olman Chinchilla, leaders of the CMTC (Central del Movimiento de Trabajadores Costarricenses) are among the trade union leaders accused.
A total of 18 trade unionists were denounced.
The complaint was lodged by the same parliamentary group that had earlier filed a case with the Constitutional Court against clauses of collective bargaining agreements, providing further proof of its blatant anti-union policy aimed at de-legitimising the instruments of trade union organisations, by firstly declaring collective agreements unconstitutional and now trying to indict trade unionists for filing complaints to tripartite international organisations.
Bad example set by Labour Ministry, accused of violating trade union rights: In April, the staff association of the Labour Ministry, AFUMITRA (Asociación de Funcionarios del Ministerio de Trabajo), denounced the Minister and Vice Minister of Labour and Social Security (MTSS) for unduly hindering the right to collective bargaining and trade union representation, preventing the union at the MTSS from freely exercising its role.
The first cause for complaint was the excessive delay in the processing of the draft Collective Agreement.
Nine months had gone by since the union had submitted the draft and the process had still not been launched.
The second cause for complaint was the attempt to undermine the trade union representation of the workers.
The MTSS had launched a process of restructuring within the National Pensions Office without consulting the union, setting up subcommittees with representatives of the Administration but not the workers.
On 8 November 2007, the Labour Inspectorate ruled that there were grounds for filing cases in the Labour Tribunals against the Minister and Vice Minister of Labour and Social Security, Francisco Morales and Guillermo Matamoros.
However, the hearing had not yet been convened by the end of the year.
Attempts were made to justify the dismissal on grounds of alleged incorrect use of trade union leave on three occasions during 2004 and 2005, despite the fact that this case had already been heard following a complaint lodged by the previous administration in 2005 and was dismissed on verifying that the leave granted to Alicia Vargas was in keeping with that established in the collective agreement.
Two years later, the INS reopened the case in a deliberate bid to harass the leadership of the UPINS, which is the strongest opponent to its plans to open the insurance market within the framework of the FTA implementation agenda.
The CGT filed a complaint with the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association, denouncing the Costa Rican government for the persecution of trade unionists.
The trade union leaders also lodged two appeals for protection with the Constitutional Court based on irregularities in the process.
The Court agreed to examine the two appeals and, as a result, the INS was unable to implement the decision.
At the end of the year the Court had still not pronounced a ruling and the dismissal order remained paralysed, but the INS Administration's resolve to uphold the decision did not wane, despite a strong international campaign against it.
Galletano Villagra Torres had been one of the negotiators of the previous collective agreement and his dismissal is a clear sign of the company's strategy to remove the more experienced unionists from the negotiations and thereby undermine the bargaining process.
This tactic impedes the negotiations since one of the sides, the union, is weakened.
Trade union persecution in the guise of administrative and legal processes: During the first week of December, the presidency of the Costa Rican Electricity Institute (ICE) filed charges with the Public Prosecutor's Office against three trade union leaders from the ICE staff union, the ASDEICE (Asociación de Empleados del ICE).
The President of the union, Fabio Chavez, and two members of its Executive, Francisco Aguilar García and Jorge Arturo Vega, were faced with the accusations after blocking access to the main entrance to the ICE on 26 November.
ASDEICE had taken this step as part of a nationwide day of action by trade unions and civil society groups in protest at the government bill to deregulate the telecommunications sector as part of the FTA implementation agenda.
At the same time as pressing criminal charges, the company filed a case against the three leaders for "breach of duty", to investigate the incidents of that day.
The real motive behind the action taken by the ICE is to rid itself of the trade union leadership, which poses a major obstacle to the plans to liberalise the economy and fulfil the commitments undertaken with the signing of the FTA.
2008 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Côte d'Ivoire
With their harsh repression of demonstrations and imprisonment of trade unionists, the authorities' record on respect of trade union rights remained poor.
The Constitution of 23 July 2000 guarantees the right to form trade unions and the right to strike in both the public and private sectors.
The labour laws give workers, the liberal professions and self-employed workers who do not employ staff, the right to form and join trade unions.
Only military personnel and police officers are excluded from these provisions, which is not in contravention of international labour standards.
Employers are prohibited from applying pressure either for or against a trade union.
Only Côte d'Ivoire nationals, nationals of a country with which reciprocal trade union and worker protection agreements have been concluded, and foreigners who have been legal residents in the country for at least three years, may exercise administrative and managerial functions in a trade union.
Right to strike – restrictions: Strikes are prohibited until a complicated conciliation and mediation procedure has been exhausted and a notice period of six working days has elapsed.
In the public sector, the right to strike is also recognised, once again with the obligation to respect the six day notice period.
Staggered work stoppages or rolling strikes are prohibited.
A minimum service is required, in particular in public hospitals.
Collective bargaining: All workers, with the exception of military personnel and police officers, have the right to collective bargaining.
The ILO has noted that the Labour Code does not provide sufficient sanctions to deter employers taking measures against trade unionists for trade union activities.
Trade union rights in practice and Violations in 2007
Demonstration suppressed: On 30 January, members of the national union representing workers at SOFEDOR (the forestry plantation development company) were attacked by police in front of their company's offices.
Three demonstrators were injured.
The union had just started a strike to protest against the company's bad management.
The anti-union practices of SOFEDOR (arbitrary application of collective agreements and dismissal of three union activists) were criticised in an earlier edition of this Survey.
Strikers charged by security forces: On 12 March, a demonstration by members of the independent trade union of employees of BIP-Assistance, a security firm, who had been on strike since 19 February, was dispersed by force.
The union was demanding a risk allowance and the payment of paid holidays and overtime.
According to the workers' representatives, the management had refused all negotiations and had rejected a request to meet the Labour Inspectorate.
A doctor's union is placed under supervision: On 31 August, the courts appointed an administrator to take charge of the National Union of Senior Health Service Managers ("Syndicat national des cadres supérieurs de la santé de Côte d'Ivoire", SYNACASS-CI).
On 8 August, the organisation had launched a strike by hospital doctors to demand the application of the new salary scale promised by the government and payment of the salaries of recently recruited health service officials.
A few days later, the SYNACASS-CI had called off the strike after signing an agreement.
The organisation had been placed under official supervision following a complaint by a group of doctors opposed to a property transaction carried out by the union.
Though this was a "purely internal" matter, as the government admitted a few days later after cancelling the appointment of the administrator, it led to the renewal and continuation of the strike until mid-September.
Governor proposed stopping state employee furloughs and replacing them with a 5% pay cut, a 5% increase in contributions to retirement plans and a directive to all state departments to cut overall payroll costs by 5% through layoffs, attrition, or hiring people at lower salaries.
In addition, another 5% pay cut could be triggered if the federal government does not come through with additional funding that the Governor has asked for.
Enacted: The state’s seven constitutional officers, which include the governor, attorney general and state superintendant, will get a 4% pay cut in 2011.
Enacted: The governor and the state’s employees unions reached an agreement on a voluntary furlough program and a pay freeze.
Under the furlough program, for every two furlough days agreed to by an employee, the employee can take an extra day off at Thanksgiving and over the Christmas and New Year's break.
Under the pay freeze agreement, scheduled raises for union workers are delayed until July 1, 2011.
In exchange, the state agreed not to layoff union workers through June 30, 2011.
The plan also prevents the state from closing any additional facilities through June 30, 2011.
The union concessions are expected to save the state $180 million in FY 2011.
The furlough and pay freeze agreement was reached after the unions won a lawsuit in September 2009 preventing the governor from laying off 2,600 state employees.
Enacted: SF 2062, the State Employee Early Retirement Incentive Program (SERIP), provided state employees 55 years of age or older the option of early retirement.
The program was initially estimated to save $57 million annually, but employee participation was higher than originally anticipated leading to estimated savings of $88.6 million.
Enacted: In May 2010, the governor signed into law changes to the school employee retirement system.
As an incentive for early retirement, the new law increased to 1.6% from 1.5% the multiplier used to calculate pension benefits.
The percentage is multiplied by average final compensation and years of employment to determine an employee’s annual pension.
Beginning July 1st, all teachers will begin contributing an additional 3% of earnings to the state retiree health care fund.
Based on an initial estimate of 27,000 early retirees, the state estimated annual savings of $680 million.
At the deadline in June 2010, actual retirees numbered 17,063, resulting in estimated savings of $515 million annually, according to the Michigan Office of Retirement Services.
Senate proposed a salary cap for elected officials, while the House proposed a pay cut.
International Trade Union Confederation, 2008 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Dominican Republic, 20 November 2008, available at: http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/4c52ca962.html [accessed 20 September 2010]
2008 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Dominican Republic
Freedom of association: All workers are free to organise, with the exception of members of the armed forces and the police force.
Unions must have at least 20 members and are legal once they have been registered by the Labour Ministry.
If the government fails to act on an application for registration within 30 days, the applicants may declare it in default over the next three days, and then one day later, the union is automatically recognised.
Unions may form federations, which can in turn form confederations.
There are some restrictions, however.
Civil servants may, for instance, only form a union if at least 60 per cent of the employees of a given governmental body agree to join.
Employees of independent and municipal state bodies are excluded from the Labour Code.
The laws and regulations governing these bodies contain no provisions on trade union freedoms.
Restrictions on the right to strike: Strikes can only be called if a majority of employees, regardless of whether they are trade union members, vote in favour of action – a requirement which could seriously hinder strike action.
There must have been a prior attempt to resolve the conflict through mediation.
If this fails, written notification of the strike must be given to the Ministry of Labour and a 10-day waiting period observed before the strike goes ahead.
Trade union rights in practice and Violations in 2007
Poor law enforcement and inefficient judicial process: Although trade union members and their leaders are protected from dismissal by law, the legislation is poorly enforced and the legal penalties are insufficient to dissuade employers from violating workers' rights.
Restrictions in the public sector: Given that over 58 per cent of formal economy workers are State employees, the exercise of the right to strike is limited.
What is more, despite the Law on the Civil Service and Administrative Careers, mass dismissals take place in the public sector without any guarantee of compensation.
Terms of employment make it hard to organise trade unions: In the stagnating formal economy, companies are increasingly imposing so-called "flexible" terms of employment, which are gradually stripping workers of their rights and indirectly hindering freedom of association.
Employers exploit this situation, forcing them to work under near slave-like conditions.
Such exploitation also applies to Dominicans of Haitian descent, many of whom are expelled from the country by the police, regardless of their dual nationality.
They have no way of asserting their rights.
As a result, recruiting foreigners is becoming a strategy used by companies to lower labour standards and prevent organising.
Employers refuse to recognise trade unions and use various strategies to prevent their creation or to destroy them.
Companies distribute lists of union activists to prevent them from finding new jobs.
Some companies turn to specialised agencies when hiring staff in order to screen out trade union and human rights activists, etc.
Where unions do exist there are many cases of their leaders being dismissed or subjected to campaigns involving discrimination, threats and constant intimidation.
Dismissals and subcontracting, a dual strategy to combat unions: In April, one of the Nestlé factories in the Dominican Republic dismissed 45 of its employees to replace them with subcontracted workers.
The company's aim is to have as few workers as possible under its responsibility.
The subcontracted workers cannot be represented by the union at the Nestlé ice cream factory (Sindicato de Trabajadores de la Empresa Helados Nestlé Dominicana), nor does the collective agreement apply to them, which means that the subcontractors can pay them starvation wages, force them to work overtime without pay, and deprive them of social security contributions.
Trade unionists denied access to export processing zones: Trade union activists and organisers from FENATRAZONAS are forbidden from entering the Santiago EPZ.
2008 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - El Salvador
A Constitutional Court ruling declared ILO Conventions 87 and 98 on freedom of association and collective bargaining, ratified by El Salvador in 2006, unconstitutional.
National and international trade union leaders denounced the ruling as a further move by the judicial authorities to prevent the free exercise of trade union rights.
A new Terrorism Act is being applied to trade unionists to penalise social protest.
A trade union leader was assassinated.
Several trade union leaders were dismissed for creating trade unions.
The Ministry of Labour has been denying unions the right to register.
The Constitution and Labour Code recognise the right of private sector workers and employees of autonomous public agencies to form trade unions.
All public sector workers not employed by autonomous agencies, such as public hospitals and the State owned electricity company, do not have the right to join or form trade unions, and cannot engage in collective bargaining.
In 2006 the government ratified ILO conventions 87, 98, 135 and 151.
The Civil Service Law has increased the restrictions on organising in the public sector.
The people excluded from the scope of the Convention, and thus from the right to organise, are not only senior civil servants, but also people with such diverse jobs as warehouse managers, treasurers, tax collectors, paymasters, etc.
In addition, the law fails to include provisions relating to the other fundamental rights required for exercising freedom of association in the public sector, such as those relating to the forming of federations and confederations, trade union immunity, the honouring of collective agreements, the implementation of anti-discriminatory practices and non-interference by state officials in trade union affairs.
The Constitution does, however, allow State employees to organise themselves in associations in order to defend their interests.
Restrictions on freedom of association: To be legally registered, trade unions must follow complex procedures, including the requirement to obtain prior authorisation from the government.
What is more, if legal registration of a union is denied, any attempts to promote organising of the union are banned for the next six months.
A union must have a minimum of 35 members in the workplace and members of a union's leadership bodies must be Salvadorian by birth.
Trade unions cannot take part in political activities.
Restrictions on the right to collective bargaining: The state restricts the negotiation of collective agreements by stipulating in the Labour Code that in order to engage in collective bargaining for the first time a union's membership must represent at least 51 percent of the workforce in the company or workplace.
Strike restrictions: There are restrictions on the right to strike, including the requirement that 51 per cent of workers, whether or not they are members of a union, must support a strike in an enterprise.
A strike can only be called if it concerns a change or renewal of a collective agreement or the defence of the workers' professional interests.
Unions must wait four days after receiving the approval of the Ministry of Labour before beginning a strike.
According to the Ministry of Labour, all strikes in El Salvador have been illegal.
That approach is backed up in law, since appealing against any legal ruling declaring a strike to be illegal is prohibited.
Inadequate protection against unfair dismissal: The Labour Code does not provide for the reinstatement of dismissed workers, although that right does exist by virtue of the San Salvador Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights signed by El Salvador.
Some time ago, an ILO recommendation stated that the reinstatement of dismissed workers was a necessary component of protection against unfair dismissal.
Trade union immunity limited: Trade union immunity is only granted to the 35 founders of a union, so all other members are excluded.
What is more, the protection ends the moment the official notification of the acceptance or rejection of a request for legal registration is received, thus leaving all the workers who were entitled to form a union totally unprotected from dismissal thereafter.
Trade union rights in practice and Violations in 2007
Labour inspectorate – failing in its duty: Another obstacle to the observance of trade union rights is the Labour Inspectorate's failure to apply proper inspection procedures or enforce the law, ignoring anti-union behaviour and preferring not to fine big companies.
Unions have complained they are not allowed to take part in inspections and are often not notified when inspections take place, while workers have reported that labour inspectors do not even speak to the workforce.
Similarly, workers are not allowed to see the inspectors' reports or are given them late.
Labour Ministry: anti-union practices at the behest of the employers: On various occasions, the Labour Ministry has given legal backing to employers' requests to remove clauses from collective agreements.
In that way, the Ministry has been disregarding the legality of those agreements and the fact that they were agreed collectively.
Mass dismissals undermining trade unions: Mass dismissals of workers and union leaders, without severance pay, are very common in El Salvador.
The de facto acceptance of that practice has encouraged employers' use of the strategy to undermine trade unions.
Trade unionists right to work violated: Discriminatory "blacklists" are one of the tools used most frequently by employers against trade unions, in particular in the export processing zones.
By denying jobs to people with some previous links to trade unions, companies are excluding virtually all trade unionists from these zones, thus making it harder to create new unions.
The various firms are all involved in sending these lists to one another.
What is more, despite receiving repeated complaints, the state institutions are doing nothing to tackle this problem.
Another means of anti-union repression was a raid by armed guards on the workers' buses to seize the trade union bulletins that their union colleagues had given to them just a few moments earlier outside the plant.
The Ministry of Labour recognised the union in July but by the end of the year SGTIPAC was still asking the company to begin negotiations on a new collective agreement and the reinstatement of the dismissed workers.
Calvo-El Salvador's Spanish management continued to firmly refuse to recognise the workers' union or negotiate a collective agreement.
This happened despite promises made by the Director General of hospitals on 9 July that he would open dialogue with the union to discuss its demands and that there would be no reprisals against the trade union leaders and workers taking part in the protests.
This recently introduced law can carry with it terms of 40 to 60 years' imprisonment for trade unionists and social activists, for exercising the legitimate right to social protest.
It allows any trade union action, such as the defence of the right to work and to health care, to be arbitrarily classified as a terrorist act, and therefore constitutes an attack on freedom of association.
Trade unionist murdered: Miguel Ángel Vásquez Argueta, the Finance Secretary on the Executive Board of the Electrical Sector Workers' Union (STSEL) was murdered on Tuesday 17 July.
He was kidnapped on his way home from work.
His body was found the following day, with two gunshot wounds to the head.
Miguel Vásquez Argueta was not carrying money or any valuables, and only his documents were taken from him.
The reasons for his murder are not known, but it is suspected that it was because of his trade union activism.
Application of ILO Conventions short-lived: Although ILO Conventions 87 and 98 on Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining were ratified in September 2006, it took a long time before they came into force.
During this time, several workers' organisations in the public sector, which had historically been denied the right to form trade unions, prepared their documents and their requests for accreditation as trade unions.
At least four of them submitted their documents to the Labour Ministry in the early hours of 7 September 2007, the first day the Conventions formally entered into force in the country.
This enthusiasm lasted for barely one month, as on 16 October the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice declared the Conventions unconstitutional.
The principal reason was because they extended freedom of association rights to public sector workers, while the constitution does not include them among those who have the right to form unions and far less to go on strike and collectively abandon their posts.
2009 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Equatorial Guinea
Trade union rights are practically impossible to exercise, especially for migrant workers.
A strike at a Chinese company was brutally suppressed by the army.
Two Chinese workers were killed, around a hundred arrested and over 400 repatriated.
Obstacles to freedom of association: The Constitution provides for the right to establish trade unions.
According to the 1992 law on trade unions, however, a union must have at least 50 members from the same workplace and the same geographical area in order to register, which effectively blocks union organising.
Section 6 of Act No.
12/1992 stipulates that "the unionisation of public administration officials will be governed by a specific law", which has still not been adopted.
The right to strike and to collective bargaining exist, but there are no provisions protecting workers from acts of anti-union discrimination.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2008
Union recognition denied: Despite its legislation, the government does not recognise "independent" trade unions.
The authorities have consistently refused to register the Unión Sindical de Trabajadores de Guinea Ecuatorial (UST, Workers' Union of Equatorial Guinea), which cannot therefore operate openly.
The authorities also refused to legalise the independent public sector services union, the Sindicato Independiente de Servicios (SIS).
Although it met all the registration criteria, the government objected to the term "independent" in its title.
Two other unions, both affiliates of the UST, the Asociación Sindical de Docentes (ASD, Teachers' Union) and the Organización de los Trabajadores del Campo (OTC, Organisation of Rural Workers), have also been denied recognition, on a technicality regarding their statutes.
Furthermore, when a notary was asked to certify their statutes so that the unions could meet the registration requirements he reportedly refused, stating that trade unions did not exist in Equatorial Guinea.
Obstacles to union organisation: Although the law provides for the right to organise and bargain collectively, the government places practical obstacles in the way of any attempt to exercise these rights.
The government and employers set the wages, with little or no worker participation.
There is no evidence of negotiations ever being held.
The Labour Ministry does, however, sometimes mediate in labour disputes.
Workplace hazards – protestors risk dismissal: The Labour Code provides for protection from occupational hazards, but since in practice there are no trade unions, employees who protest against unhealthy or dangerous working conditions risk losing their jobs.
A temporary layoff lets an employer suspend, cut back or stop an employee's employment without permanently ending or terminating the employment.
For example, an employer may layoff employees when there is not enough work to do.
Seniority may affect layoffs only if there is a collective agreement (union contract) at the workplace.
The Act does not require employers consider length of service when laying off employees.
Employee questions about seniority should be directed to the union or bargaining agents.
Usually, no.
The Act says that after certain periods of layoff, an employer may have to pay an employee termination pay, severance pay or both.
If an employee has a collective agreement (union contract) at his or her workplace or an employment contract with his or her employer, it may have rules about how long a layoff may last.
For the purposes of establishing an employee's right to termination pay, a week of layoff is one when an employee gets less than one half (½) of the wages earned in a regular work week with no overtime.
without work because of a strike or lockout.
Termination pay must be the same as the employee's regular pay without overtime.
An employee may qualify for severance pay after 35 weeks of layoff in any period of 52 consecutive weeks.
To establish an employee's right to severance pay, a week of layoff is one in which the employee gets less than one quarter (¼) of the wages earned in a regular work week that has no overtime.
without work because of a strike or lockout.
Under the Act, an employee can get severance pay only if:
If the above conditions are not met, an employee does not qualify for severance pay.
If an employee has been laid-off because the employer has closed all of its business permanently, he or she may be entitled to severance pay after one week of layoff.
Please refer to the "Severance Pay" Fact Sheet or contact the nearest Ministry of Labour office.
If an employee qualifies for severance pay, the employer will give the employee a lump sum payment that is equal to one week's regular pay for each year the employee was employed.
The employee also gets credit for full months of employment.
For example, if he or she worked for 10½ years, the employer would pay the employee 10½ weeks' regular pay as the severance pay.
There is a limit of 26 weeks' regular pay for severance pay.
Even if an employee has worked longer than 26 years, 26 weeks is the most he or she can get under the Act.
Are there reasons why an employee might not get termination and severance pay?
Yes, there are reasons why an employee would not get severance pay, termination pay or both.
The most common reasons are listed below:
An employee doesn't get either termination pay or severance pay if he or she:
was terminated during or because of a strike or lockout at his or her place of work;
has refused work available through a seniority system (this is also called "bumping").
An employee does not get severance pay if he or she:
is terminated during or as the result of a strike or lockout at his or her place of work, and the employer can show that the job the employee did no longer exists because of the economic effects of the strike;
Yes, an employee may work somewhere else for another employer during a layoff.
This does not mean the employee loses any of his or her rights to termination or severance pay.
If the employee decides to go back, he or she must do so within a reasonable period of time.
If the employee refuses to return, he or she may lose the right to termination pay or severance pay:
if an employee is already entitled to termination pay or severance (after 13 or 35 weeks of layoff) when the employer calls him or her back to work, the employee will not lose the right to the termination or severance pay by refusing to return to work.
Refuses to return to work when the employer calls the employee back to a job that is not a reasonable alternative, but it is offered through a seniority system under a collective agreement.
In this case, the employer does not have to pay the employee termination pay.
But the employer may still have to pay the employee severance once the layoff has lasted 35 weeks in any period of 52 weeks.
"Recall rights" is a term used in collective agreements (union contracts).
It means being called back to work by the employer after being laid off.
: If an employee has a collective agreement at his or her place of work, the employee should ask the union for details about recall rights.
If the layoff has lasted for 13 weeks, and benefits were not paid or the employee was not eligible for supplementary EI, the employee keeps any recall rights he or she may have under his or her collective agreement.
If an employee has recall rights and is eligible for severance pay because the layoff has exceeded 35 weeks in 52, he or she has to choose between:
If the employee decides to take the severance pay immediately, he or she will lose recall rights;
If the employee decides to keep his or her recall rights, the employer will send the severance pay to the Ministry of Labour.
It will be kept in trust for the employee.
accept the recall: if the employee accepts the recall, the ministry will return any termination or severance pay it is holding in trust to the employer;
refuse the recall: the employee is still entitled to termination or severance pay which is being held by the ministry.
The ministry will send it to the employee.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Russian Federation
Trade unions suffer from official interference and employers' anti-union practices alike.
A union leader was threatened and assaulted, and at least 60 workers lost their jobs in connection with their trade union activities.
The right to strike is limited, and collective bargaining is impeded by excessive requirements.
The systematic pressure on trade unions, exercised by some employers and state officials, led two trade unions centers, VKT and KTR, to submit an ILO complaint, supported by the other trade union center, FNPR and the international trade union movement.
Despite initial guarantees, trade union rights are coupled with many restrictions.
While freedom of association is enshrined in the Constitution and the Labour Code, in November 2009 the Constitutional court withdrew the requirement that consent of a higher trade union body is required in case of dismissal of elected, but not full-time, trade union officials.
The right to collective bargaining is also circumscribed as only one collective agreement can be signed in each enterprise on behalf of all the workers.
Bargaining can be initiated by "primary group" trade unions that represent at least 50% of the workforce, or a group of unions if no primary group union exists.
Furthermore, the right to strike is limited, as strikes can only be held to resolve a collective labour dispute, and solidarity strikes as well as strikes related to state policies are not recognised.
Railway workers do not have the right to strike, and the categories of workers employed in the internal affairs agencies who are prohibited from striking have not yet been specified.
The duration of a strike must always be announced in advance, and the law seems to impose compulsory arbitration in services that are not essential.
The right to strike is also weakened by the employers' right to hire replacement workers during a strike.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Interference with union affairs: Registration rules give law enforcement bodies extensive control over the content of trade union constitutions.
Registrars often interpret the law in a manner that unions perceive as inappropriate, but failure to comply with the registrar's comments will likely mean that the registration is delayed or denied.
The law also requires the unions to specify the geographic scope of its activities.
The registrars view this as an obligation to provide a list of all territories where the affiliates are active, and accepting affiliates from other regions would call for amendments to the union constitution.
Trade union leaders are often summoned by law enforcement bodies for different reasons.
In most cases, this does not lead to further consequences and, in trade unionists' view, are just used to pressurise and harass them.
Occasionally, criminal charges are considered against the unionists.
Tax inspections and auditions are not uncommon, and failure to provide documents such as lists of members may result in fines.
Police officers are also after union rosters: for example, after an employee was murdered in a company in Togliatti, the investigators demanded the full list of members of grass root trade union organisations, even though there was no link between the unions and the murder.
Systematic and serious violations: Attacks on trade union leaders, government interference and persecution, denial of registration and recognition, anti-union harassment in the workplaces and lack of effort in investigating the violations of trade union rights are not isolated cases, but an everyday reality.
This has prompted two national trade union centres, All-Russian Confederation of Labour (VKT) and Confederation of Labour of Russia (KTR) to prepare a comprehensive complaint to the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association.
By the time of writing, the complaint has been submitted and then endorsed by the Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia (FNPR), the ITUC and the global union federations IMF, ITF and IUF.
Workers who join trade unions or engage in union activities are often mistreated by employers and authorities alike.
While union members suffer from anti-union discrimination and pressure to relinquish their trade union membership, the leaders of grass-root organisations are subject to intimidation, harassment and even physical attacks.
Since there are no special laws to protect freedom of association and the right to organise, trade unionists must make use of general legal procedures to protect their rights and liberties.
Even though there have been some success stories of a conflict being settled or a wrongly dismissed leader reinstated, the existing mechanisms are considered ineffective.
National legislation is also being interpreted in a way that all cases of anti-union discrimination have to be reviewed by courts.
Therefore, labour inspectorates, who are in principle entrusted with the task of overseeing compliance with the labour law, routinely dismiss complaints against anti-union behaviour, and appeals to the prosecutor's offices have so far not been effective.
Trade unions report that the existing system fuels a climate of impunity in the workplaces.
Moreover, appeals to the prosecutor's offices often do more harm than good, as prosecutors tend to side with the employers against the unions, and, after the investigation is concluded, anti-union pressure increases.
No external access to workplaces: The law grants external trade union representatives the right to access workplaces, but this right is often ignored in practice.
For example, numerous state and private security companies handling commercial sea ports often refuse access passes, procrastinate on issuing them or demand that fees be paid, and sometimes also request lists of trade union members working in the port.
Attempts to enlist the help of the public authorities have yielded little result, since the prosecutor's offices redirect the matter to the Ministry of Transportation that does not have the appropriate mandate.
General Motors: Trade Union Leader Attacked: In January, Evgeniy Ivanov, chairman of an organisation of the Inter-regional Trade Union of Automobile Industry Workers (MPRA) at the General Motors Avto production plant, received an anonymous phone call.
"You should not have founded the union" the caller said, "you probably aren't thinking of your family at all".
This was already the fourth telephone threat after the union was established in December 2008.
Although Ivanov had the phone calls recorded, the police refused to open an investigation on 4 February.
Four days after the call, Ivanov was attacked in the lobby of his apartment building.
Two unidentified persons hit the activist in the face several times, while saying "greetings from the trade union".
Ivanov suffered a concussion and a nose fracture.
This time, the police promptly opened a criminal investigation.
However, shortly thereafter Ivanov was summoned to the so-called "E-Centre" (Office for combating extremism of the Saint Petersburg's Ministry of Internal Affairs).
The E-Centre officers tried to pressurise Ivanov into "co-operating" with them, which meant giving information on trade union activities in Saint Petersburg.
By the manner this meeting was conducted, Ivanov's lawyer grew suspicious about the E-Centre's possible involvement in the attacks, and tried to get the case transferred to a different jurisdiction.
Union leader dismissed, his supporters follow: On 19 January, the Centrosvarmash company in Tver fired Dmitry Kozhnev, leader of the local organisation of the Inter-regional Trade Union of Automobile Industry Workers (MPRA).
A conflict between the management and trade union had been triggered by Kozhnev's appeal to the company to pay due attention to health and safety at work.
Lay-offs target trade unions: The management of GM-Avtovaz has been hostile towards the Inter-regional Trade Union of Automobile Industry Workers (MPRA) since its founding in 2006.
In March, the company laid off 400 employees, including Ilsiyar Sharafutdinova, who had been dismissed and reinstated several times, and 49 other trade union members.
25 trade unionists appealed the redundancy, but Sharafutdinova was the only one reinstated.
The company also prohibited the MPRA co-chair from visiting the workplaces, regardless of an order from the prosecutor's office.
Ford Motors update: Etmanov still harassed: Alexey Etmanov, the chairman of the local branch of the Inter-regional Trade Union of Automobile Industry Workers (MPRA) at the Ford Motors Company Plant outside Saint-Petersburg, had been attacked twice in 2008.
An arrest had been made in connection with the attack, but the suspect had been released and then disappeared.
In April, coming home after a night shift, Etmanov and some fellow trade unionists discovered two hidden video cameras pointing at Etmanov's apartment door.
The door was covered with faeces.
This time, Etmanov did not file a police complaint.
Reprisals due to union materials: The local branch of the Inter-regional Trade Union of Automobile Industry Workers (MPRA) at the Centrosvarmash company in Tver prepared some campaign materials earlier in the year and circulated them among the union activists.
In autumn, after the The Federal List of Extremist Materials (managed by the federal Ministry of Justice) had been updated, the union learned that, in a process the union was completely unaware of, the Zavolzhsky District Court of Tver had classified some of union leaflets as "extremist".
National legislation prohibits the production and dissemination of materials listed as "extremist".
The Ministry's list, referring specifically to the Zavolzhsky District Court decision of 28 August, includes, for example, leaflets with the slogan "let those who caused the crisis pay for it", or variations thereof, phrases such as "against non-standard work arrangements" or "we demand our night shift pay" together with the MPRA logo, or caricatures depicting declining economic indicators.
Trade unions are still unable to obtain the court verdict, and therefore cannot appeal against it.
There were also attempts to instigate criminal proceeding against Dmitri Kozhnev, the leader of the MPRA at Centrosvarmash.
Kozhnev was called up by Federal Security Service (FSB) officers and asked about the trade union newspaper.
Kozhnev was not given access to his file, but learned that there were at least ten complaints against him.
In Togliatti, the Department for Combating Extremism took particular interest in the MPRA and its grass-root affiliate "Yedinstvo".
In July, on his way back from a union meeting in Moscow, Petr Zolotarev, MPRA co-chair and leader of Yedinstvo, was approached by department officers and questioned about the meeting.
In October, Zolotarev was interrogated on actions planned by trade unions, possible participants, lists of speakers and demands to be put forward.
Zolotarev reports that he feels he is being constantly watched ever since.
The ECHR ruled that the State had violated articles 11 and 14 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (freedom of association and non-discrimination), since it had failed to fulfil its positive obligations to adopt effective and clear judicial protection against discrimination on the ground of trade union membership.
Twenty-eight of the applicants were also awarded EUR 2,500 each in non-pecuniary damages.
The Government tried to have the case reviewed by the ECHR Grand Chamber, but its request for referral was rejected (and the decision became final) on 23 December.
Conflict at GM Auto: In October, a number of grass-root trade union organisations affiliated to the Inter-regional Trade Union of Automobile Industry Workers (MPRA) brought their work-related demands to the management of GM Avto company in Saint Petersburg.
Two work-to-rule actions were then organised in October and November, which triggered employer retaliation.
One union leader was fired for unauthorised absence from work (although he was, in fact, working), another one was suspended, a third one was not getting a raise, and a woman trade unionist was fired for incapacity to work following a biased health examination.
Unionists harassed at Nestle WaterCoolers Service: In October, workers at Nestle WaterCoolers Service in Domodedovo, Moscow, established a trade union to address the problem of eroding real wages and
deteriorating working conditions.
The management immediately launched an anti-union campaign: it began distributing the workload in a discriminatory manner so that the trade union members were unable to finish their tasks within the normal working hours or fulfil their quotas.
Since most of the wages are performance-based, trade union members had to work 12-14 hours per day and hardly received 18,000 RUR (431 EUR) per month.
Union leader questioned: On 16 October, an organisation within the structure of the Inter-regional Trade Union of Automobile Industry Workers (MPRA) was established at the Tver Car Building Plant.
Shortly thereafter all trade union members were officially summoned to the prosecutor's office to provide an explanation for the establishment of the trade union.
Only one unionist showed up.
A representative of the prosecutor's office then visited the company to interrogate the union leader on the procedure for founding the union, on questions discussed at the founding meeting, on trade union printed materials and on whether the union leader had travelled to Saint Petersburg.
Registration obstructed: Two national trade union centres, the All-Russia Confederation of Labour VKT, and the Russian Confederation of Labour KTR report numerous problems with trade union registration.
On 2 April, the Moscow City Court upheld an earlier court decision to effectively ban the Trade Union of Railway Locomotive Brigades RPLBZh from operating at the national level (see the 2009 edition of the Survey for details).
The union explained that only its congress could change the union's geographic status, and that organising a congress is time-consuming.
Nevertheless, between May and September the bailiffs ordered RPLBZh to pay a 5,000 roubles (120 EUR) enforcement charge and later a 30 000 penalty, and RPLBZh leaders received several warnings on criminal liability for failure to comply with a court ruling.
An RPLBZh extraordinary congress convened on 9-10 September to make the required changes in its constitution and name, but in October the Ministry of Justice denied registration of the amendments.
On 19 November, trade union leader Evgeniy Kulikov was charged with failure to implement the court ruling.
Widespread anti-union activities at AvtoVAZ: The Avtovaz car production company in Togliatti was noted in the 2008 Survey for attacks on trade union leaders, and the situation has not improved.
Members of the "Yedinstvo" trade union have been pressured to resign, leaders have been suspended from work, and some workers have not been paid bonuses or been denied time off.
One woman worker reported that from the moment she joined "Yedinstvo" she would only get difficult and low-paid assignments, and that her salary dropped by over 20% as a result.
Another worker was promised rewards, higher tariff rates and advanced training if he only resigned from "Yedinstvo".
On 11 June, management was notified that a number of workers of the KOP company that provides catering for Avtovaz employees had joined "Yedinstvo".
The new members were immediately told that they were "blacklisted" and that they should leave the union.
Management has also repeatedly refused to allow external trade union representatives access to the workplace.
"Yedinstvo" made several appeals to the Prosecutor's Office.
The office organised some inspections, but they were purely formal and often only the employers' representatives were contacted.
The union also tried to obtain access to the workplace for external trade union representatives via a court order, but this claim was rejected on 11 March.
No recognition at TagAZ: The local organisation of the Inter-regional Trade Union of Automobile Industry Workers (MPRA) at the TagAZ Taganrogsky branch has been fighting for recognition.
The branch management has refused to acknowledge the official notifications on the establishment of the union, and has reported to the state auditing agencies that no trade union organisation exists in the branch.
TagAZ was noted in the 2009 edition of the Survey for attacks and threats against trade union leaders.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Saudi Arabia
The exploitation of migrant workers, particularly domestic workers, is still the norm in Saudi Arabia.
Twenty-three Chinese workers were expelled for taking part in a strike.
The few trade union rights that exist are seriously circumscribed.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Exploitation of migrant workers: Thousands of migrant workers who are either not legally resident or who have outstayed their visa, as well as others who have fled deplorable working conditions, want to be arrested by the police and sent home as soon as possible.
Although the law bans employers from retaining the passports of migrant workers without their consent, the practice remains frequent and leaves migrant workers with no other recourse than the intervention of their consulate or the police to get sent home.
In July, Saudi Arabia's Shura Council finally passed, after several years' deliberations, an annex to the labour law that requires employers to provide domestic workers at least nine hours of rest each day and suitable accommodation.
However, it still contains provisions that leave workers exposed to abuse, such as the duty to obey employers' order and a prohibition against leaving the workplace without a "legitimate reason.
"
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - South Africa
Workers exercising the right to strike were heavily penalised during the year.
There were also repeated incidents of the police firing rubber bullets and tear gas at strikers taking part in pickets and protests, often resulting in injury.
Trade union rights are protected by law though the right to strike is weakened by the employers' right to hire replacement workers.
Trade union rights are guaranteed in law.
All workers, with the exception of members of the National Intelligence Agency and the Secret Service, are allowed to join unions and are protected against unfair dismissal, and unions can seek redress in court for such dismissals.
The law contains provisions to encourage collective bargaining in small businesses, and among home workers and workers in the informal economy.
Furthermore, the right to strike is recognised for all workers including those in the public sector, provided they do not work in essential services or the security forces.
However, that right is undermined by the legal right of employers to hire replacement workers during a strike.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Anti-union practices at fruit company: On 24 June the Fruit and Agricultural Workers Union (FAWU) called a strike at Expo-Frut/UNIVEG in Piketberg in frustration over the management's continued undermining of collective agreements.
Workers also claimed that management had asked them to resign from the union, that shop stewards were being victimised, with some receiving written warnings, and that there were constant attempts at union bashing.
The matter was referred to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA).
Police open fire on striking municipal workers: Police fired stun grenades, rubber bullets and teargas into a crowd of between 100 and 200 striking municipal workers in Plettenberg Bay town centre on 4 August at the start of a countrywide strike by the South African Municipal Workers' Union (SAMWU).
The march was followed closely by a strong police contingent who opened fire after a few strikers sat down in the street on the return leg of the march.
The chairman of the Congress of South African Trade Unions' (COSATU) Plett branch, Dumisane Mnweba, who was leading the marchers, said the police action was unprovoked.
Police claimed later they fired in retaliation at stones thrown at them.
Vincent Sawule was hit twice in the back and an elbow by rubber bullets and Washington Nkumada in the leg.
Sean Lose's arm was burnt by a thunderflash.
Shop stewards suspended after striking over health and safety: The South African pulp, paper, and woodlands company Sappi instigated disciplinary proceedings against 19 shop stewards and 23 other workers at the Enstra mill in Gauteng province.
The paper workers were charged with inciting three safety strikes on 5 May, 8 May, and 28 May at the 700-worker mill near Johannesburg.
The incident started when shop stewards from the Chemical, Energy, Paper, Printing, Wood, and Allied Workers Union (CEPPWAWU), intervened to prevent a worker from cleaning in a part of the mill where a piece of equipment normally performs.
When shop stewards protested that the worker had been assigned to an unsafe task, management hardened its position and the safety strikes began.
Workers shot during wage demonstration: Guards from the "Red Ants" private security company shot five municipal workers and a security guard during a wage demonstration at the Tembisa Civic Centre in Ekurhuleni by the South African Municipal Workers' Union (SAMWU) on Thursday 10 September.
It was not clear whether rubber bullets or live ammunition were used.
Some 280 rubbish collectors had been on strike since 21 August over bonus payments, salary scales and annual leave, after management had failed to implement an agreement concluded in 2007 and again in June 2008.
SAMWU spokesman Mokoena Ramotlou reported that the demonstration had been peaceful when the security guards attacked.
A municipal spokesman said the municipality was investigating circumstances which led to the incident, adding that the Red Ants were called in by the municipality to ensure stability.
The six injured people were taken to hospital.
Union recognition obstructed: Over 40 of the 60 workers at Austro Wooding Machine and Tools in Roodepoort voted to join the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA).
The NUMSA organiser then approached the company to ask for recognition and other organisational rights as laid down in the Labour Relations Act (LRA).
The employer did not respond and so the union took the matter to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA).
The employer then failed to attend the dispute hearing at the CCMA.
The workers finally voted to go on strike on 9 November in support of their demands for union recognition.
The response of management was to issue notice of a lockout and employ replacement labour.
Striking hotel workers arrested: Over 30 members of the South Africa Commercial Catering and Allied Workers Union (SACCAWU) were arrested in the course of a dispute with Sun International South Africa.
Other workers were continuously provoked, harassed and subjected to all sorts of racial insults from the police and private security firms as the attempts to break the strike continued.
The dispute began on 4 December after negotiations on wages and working conditions broke down.
The union reported that the hotel management had negotiated in bad faith, continuously derailing the negotiations.
Negotiations resumed during the strike but just as it appeared that an agreement had been reached, the company reverted to its pre-strike position as a final position.
The dispute had not been resolved by the end of the year.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Sri Lanka
The Sri Lankan authorities have by no means done all they can to ensure the respect of their own labour legislation.
Trade union rights violations are commonplace in the export processing zones.
Despite initial guarantees, trade union rights are limited by excessive restrictions.
The right to form and join unions is recognised, however a number of workers are excluded or enjoy limited freedom of association, including agricultural workers.
Furthermore, public service unions are not allowed to form federations or engage in collective bargaining.
While the right to bargain collectively is guaranteed for other trade unions, they must represent over 40% of the workers at a given workplace in order to be recognised.
The right to strike is seriously circumscribed.
The long list of services defined as "essential" was removed in 2006 and replaced by a broad unrestricted definition.
The regulations allow the President to ban any organisation s/he considers to be impeding, obstructing or delaying the production and delivery of any service "which is of public utility or is essential for national security or for the preservation of public order or the life of the community and includes any department of the government or branch thereof".
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Weak enforcement of union recognition law: The recognition of unions for collective bargaining purposes is dogged by excessive delays.
Employers tend to delay the holding of polls for the creation of trade unions for a long time and use this time to identify, victimise and, frequently, fire the union activists concerned.
In the worst cases, activists have been physically assaulted and threatened with death.
As a result, workers are afraid of being identified with the union, and the union loses the poll.
To prevent such situations, the unions would like to hold their elections within four weeks of sending the application for recognition of the union.
Economic crisis used as pretext to delay social dialogue or close factories: According to the Sri Lankan trade unions, many employers have used the economic crisis to take a harder line in collective bargaining.
Moreover, workers faced with an employer's refusal to enter into social dialogue get little support from the authorities.
On the contrary, in sectors such as clothing and construction, the authorities favour flexible employment relationships.
EPZs – a history of anti-unionism: Sri Lanka's export processing zones (EPZs) are managed by the Board of Investment (BOI), which sets wages and working conditions.
In many cases, union members or officials are suspended, demoted or dismissed, and many have been assaulted.
New workers, often women, are warned not to join unions.
Union activists not employed by an enterprise in the zones are not allowed inside an EPZ unless their entry is approved by the employer.
This ban is one of the main barriers to organising in the EPZs.
Weak labour inspection in the export processing zones: Labour inspection is clearly inadequate in the Export Processing Zones (EPZs).
Government labour inspectors are not allowed to carry out unannounced visits to factories in the EPZs.
When complaints are received by the competent government body, employers rarely turn up to the hearings, and, when they do so, they frequently flout the rulings with total impunity.
The government has proved incapable of forcing employers to respect the decisions of the authorities.
This was the case for the decisions by the General Labour Commissioner regarding New Design Manufacturing Ltd. and Ceyenergy Electronics (PVT) Ltd. In other cases, the authorities completely ignore requests for mediation by the trade unions, such as at Smart Shirts Lanka Ltd.
Victimisation of union activists: Many cases of anti-union discrimination and non-recognition of trade unions have been reported.
Such offences are tried before a Magistrate's Court.
Workers and trade unions can also complain to the Human Rights Commission.
There is no time limit on bringing cases to court; hence, the employers can delay indefinitely until the union has been weakened or even disbanded.
To comply with the ILO's fundamental standards, the Government of Sri Lanka must take measures, in consultation with the social partners, to guarantee the quickest and most appropriate procedures in cases of anti-union discrimination, in particularly the setting of short deadlines for the examination of cases by the authorities.
Public sector trade union federations tolerated: Although the law prohibits federations of public sector trade unions, there are a few such federations operating openly such as the Public Service National Trade Union Federation (PSNTUF) and the Ceylon Trade Union Federation (CTUF).
These federations do not engage in collective bargaining, however, as they are not legally recognised as trade unions.
Employees' councils: Employees councils have been promoted by the Board of Investment (BOI) as a substitute for trade unions in the export processing zones (EPZs).
Employees' councils are structures funded by and functioning under the aegis of the employer and can influence workers' choices much more easily than a union (where the workers make financial contributions).
According to the BOI, their role is to promote "the effective participation of employees in the affairs of the enterprise through consultation".
In reality, the great majority of companies do not have employees' councils, as these councils tend to be created primarily as a barrier against an attempt to set up a trade union.
In some cases, management refuses to recognise an emerging trade union and will "negotiate" directly with the employees' council as if it were the workers' legitimate representative body.
In other cases, it will offer employee council members certain advantages if they don't join a union and threaten them if they do.
In the case of Work Wear Lanka, management went so far as to register the employees' council, with the approval of the authorities.
Pressure linked to US GSP and EU GSP+: The ITUC and the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) have again alerted the European Commission to the Sri Lankan government's failure to meet the commitments it made in 2005 to qualify for the GSP+ scheme, namely implementation of all the ILO's core conventions.
The ITUC and the ETUC drew attention to the government's statements to the effect that it would promote export companies in the North East regions previously caught up in the civil war.
Considering the widespread violations of workers' rights in the export processing zones in the rest of the country, the ITUC and the ETUC believe that after suffering all the atrocities linked to the war, the populations of these regions could soon be exposed to violations of their rights at work.
The US national trade union centre the AFL-CIO has put pressure on the US trade representative to remove Sri Lanka from the list of developing countries eligible to benefit from the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) until the Sri Lanka respects the conditions linked to workers' rights in the System.
Fierce anti-union discrimination at Wheel Work Ltd.: Management at the Wheel Work (Pvt.
) Ltd. factory in the Biyagama export processing zone created an employee's council following the creation of a branch of the Free Trade Zones & General Services Employees Union (FTZ&GSEU).
From the moment the union was created at the end of 2008 its members were victimised (frequent changes to working hours, downgrading to unskilled jobs, refusal of the pay rise recommended by the Board of Investment, etc.).
On 6 May, a trade union official and a union member were suspended, supposedly because of negligence.
The union member was reinstated the next day after resigning from the union.
Faced with management's refusal to meet representatives of the FTZ&GSEU, the assistant labour commissioner intervened.
Management told him that it refused to accept a union in its factory and handed over letters signed by 46 workers stating that they had disaffiliated from the union.
The union official suspended on 6 May had still not been reinstated by the end of 2009.
International Trade Union Confederation, 2009 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Bosnia and Herzegovina, 11 June 2009, available at: http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/4c52cafe28.html [accessed 20 September 2010]
2009 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Bosnia and Herzegovina
The law governing trade union registration has been improved, but numerous problems remain.
The national trade union confederation SSSBiH is still not registered.
Freedom of Association: Freedom of association is included in the constitution and the labour law of both the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (the Federation) and the Republika Srpska (RS).
All workers, including migrant workers, are free to join trade unions, with the exception of the military.
In the Federation and the RS discrimination against trade union members and leaders is prohibited.
Financial penalties are foreseen for anti-union discrimination against individuals, but there are no legal sanctions against employers who obstruct union organising.
The Revised European Social Charter of the Council of Europe was ratified in October.
All provisions governing trade union rights have been accepted.
Law on Associations and Foundations amended: In July, the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina adopted the Law on Amendments to the Law on Associations and Foundations.
The amendments address a number of ILO experts' concerns pertaining to trade union registration, but do not resolve all pending issues.
Previous authorisation: The time limits prescribed in the legislation for the registration of trade unions are very short and, in the view of the ILO, equivalent to a system of prior authorisation.
Exceeding such limitations may lead to disproportionate penalties, such as the dissolution of the organisation in question or cancellation of its registration.
The July amendments to the law slightly extended the deadlines and clarified the appeal procedures.
The law also regulates trade unions' internal procedures in great detail, restricting their freedoms.
The Minister of Justice of Bosnia and Herzegovina has the right to accept or reject trade union registration at the State level, and if no decision is made in 30 days, the registration is considered to be denied tacitly.
The 30-day deadline is rarely respected in practice.
Based on the July amendments, the Ministry of Justice or the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina can effectively dissolve a trade union.
The grounds for administrative dissolution include a situation where the trade union did not convene its assembly for a period twice exceeding what is prescribed by the trade union constitution.
Trade union activities can be prohibited by a court decision if the union's activities are not in line with the goals in its constitution.
In the RS trade unions have to pay court costs in order to be registered.
Restrictions on choosing trade union representatives: Company-level trade unions of the Republika Srpska must be entered into the General Ledger of the Ministry of Labour, War Veteran and Disability Protection.
The Rulebook of this General Ledger stipulates that the authorised trade union representative must provide a certificate of his or her employment at the company.
Should the employer fail to produce the certificate, there are neither sanctions nor alternative ways of proving one's employment.
Strikes limited: In the Federation, an employer must be notified of a strike in writing no later than ten days before the beginning of the strike.
The written notification must list the reasons for the strike, the locality, and the date and time at which the strike is to take place.
"Production maintenance" must be ensured during a strike.
How this is to be done must be worked out in advance with the employer and announced no later than ten days before the strike is due to start.
If no agreement is reached, then a strike will be declared unlawful by the court, trade unions can be fined up to 2,500 KM (EUR 1,250), and workers may be punished.
The ITUC-affiliated Confederation of Trade Unions of Bosnia and Herzegovina (SSSBiH) is campaigning to change this law.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2008
Government refusal to register SSSBiH: The Government has been refusing to register the SSSBiH since 2002, under various pretexts and regardless of the ILO pressure.
This failure to register the SSSBiH has meant that neither its branch unions nor the ITUC-affiliated KSBiH, an umbrella organisation covering the entity-level trade unions, have been able to register, and that the national-level Economic and Social Council has still not been established.
The SSSBiH also reports that employers have attempted to question the validity of the General Collective Agreement (on the grounds that it was signed by an "unregistered" organisation) and the collective agreements signed with SSSBiH affiliates.
Harassment of trade unionists: In the RS, private sector employers resort to harassment, intimidation and pressure against trade union members.
Trade unions are discouraged from bringing such cases to courts since providing evidence is very difficult and court decisions are often not implemented.
2008 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Sri Lanka
Sri Lanka's labour law is not totally in line with the international standards protecting workers' rights and is not always enforced by the authorities.
Anti-union behaviour is still rampant in the EPZs.
The Supreme Court of Sri Lanka called into question ILO principles, and some trade unionists were abducted whilst others received death threats.
On 3 August 2006, the Ordinance and the Emergency Regulations were amended to expand on the number of services defined as essential, adding to a specific schedule of sectors which was already far beyond what the ILO considers as "essential" industries.
Further to protests by Sri Lankan trade unions and their international supporters, in a further amendment to the regulation promulgated on 29 September 2006, the long list of essential services was replaced by a broad, unrestricted definition.
The Regulations allow the president to designate as "essential" any service "which is of public utility or is essential for national security or for the preservation of public order or the life of the community and includes any department of the government or branch thereof".
To make such a declaration, the president only needs to order the restriction to be issued in the government gazette.
Trade union rights in practice and Violations in 2007
Background: Sri Lanka has been experiencing a civil war since the breakdown of dialogue between the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam (LTTE) and the government.
There is general impunity for human rights violations, including violations of trade union rights.
Reports mention hundreds of disappearances, murders of people working for charity organisations, arbitrary arrests and torture.
Supreme Court questioning ILO principles: A complaint was lodged with the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association in September 2006 by the Sri Lankan trade unions, the ITGLWF and the ITF regarding a dispute between workers and the Sri Lankan Port Authority (SLPA), a state enterprise that handles all business in the ports.
Since March 2006, the SLPA had refused to negotiate in good faith with a coalition of 14 trade unions, mainly over wage demands.
The unions decided to carry out a "work to rule" strike on 13 July 2006, only observing the specific terms and conditions in their contracts and refusing to do any additional work requested by the employers.
Shortly afterwards a group of employers from the clothing industry, the Joint Apparel Association Forum, which was not involved in the dispute, filed a petition to the Supreme Court, arguing that their "fundamental right" to conduct their business activities had been breached by the unions' action (since imports and exports of clothes pass through the ports).
On 25 July 2006, the Court issued an interim order banning any action by the unions up to 25 November, partially justifying its decision through the alleged "extensive, ongoing loss suffered by the country as a whole".
The Court ordered the police and armed forces to take immediate measures to ensure that the unions respected this decision.
The union leaders involved in that protest then became victims of a campaign seeking to link them with the terrorist uprising.
Posters branding them as traitors and terrorists and calling for their arrest began to appear in public places across the country.
Those targeted include: Anton Marcus of the Free Trade Zone and General Services Employees' Union (FTZGSEU), Sman Ratnapriya and Ravi Kumudesh of the Health Sector Trade Union Alliance (HSTUA), Sampath Rajitha and Raja Kannangara of the Joint Railway Trade Union Alliance (JRTUA), and Joseph Stalin of the Ceylon Teachers' Union (CTU).
Several of them had been involved in campaigns denouncing the government's role in attacks on the right to strike and arbitrary labour law reforms.
Following this campaign, the targeted trade unionists received several death threats.
On 21 February, the FTZGSEU and the HSTUA made several complaints to the police, hoping to receive protection enabling them to continue their trade union activities.
The authorities neglected their duty; however, the police did not carry out a serious enquiry and also did little to ensure the safety of the union leaders.
Victimisation of union activists: Many serious cases have been reported of anti-union discrimination and non-recognition of trade unions.
Such offences are tried before a Magistrate's Court, and only the Labour Department can submit cases.
However, hitherto no complaints against employers alleged to have engaged in unfair labour practices have been filed.
There is no time limit on bringing cases to court; hence, they can be delayed indefinitely until the union has been weakened or even disbanded.
In 2005 and 2007, the ILO Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations repeated that the unions should have direct access to the courts.
Striking teachers arrested: Following a dispute concerning wages and promotion prospects, teachers belonging to a union decided in August to suspend their marking of examinations taken by students until the dispute was resolved.
On 9 and 13 September, without summoning the unions, the Supreme Court issued an injunction ordering the ending of the trade union action.
On 14 September, five union leaders summoned by the Supreme Court were informed that their action amounted to contempt of court and that they would be released only if they paid a sum of 50,000 rupees each as bail.
The principal of a public school in Colombo paid the 250,000 rupees needed to secure their release.
The police were then sent to the homes of teachers supposed to be marking the exams and forced them to work.
Collective bargaining: There are relatively few bargaining agreements in the private sector compared to the total number of enterprises and unions: only some 44 employers belonging to the main employers' organisation, the Employers' Federation of Ceylon, have signed a collective agreement with their employees.
EPZs – a history of anti-unionism: There are widespread violations of trade union rights in Sri Lanka's Free Trade Zones.
The zones are managed by the Board of Investment (BOI), which sets wages and working conditions and has a history of discouraging union activity.
In many cases, union members or officials are suspended, demoted or dismissed, and many have been assaulted.
New workers are warned not to join unions.
Labour inspection is clearly inadequate in these zones.
The government labour inspectors are not allowed to carry out unannounced visits to factories in the EPZs.
The BOI has its own industrial relations department, but the BOI is always headed by a prominent businessman.
In practice, therefore, the BOI's handling of industrial relations always works against the interests of the workers in the zones (most of whom are women).
Employees' councils: Employees' councils are structures funded by and functioning under the aegis of the employer, without the workers needing to make contributions.
This gives them an advantage over unions, which rely on membership dues.
This consideration inevitably influences the choice of workers.
They have been promoted by the BOI as a substitute for trade unions in the EPZs.
In theory, according to the BOI, their role is to promote "the effective participation of employees in the affairs of the enterprise through consultation".
In reality, the great majority of companies do not have employees' councils, as these councils tend to be created primarily as a barrier against an attempt to set up a trade union.
In these union substitute councils, the selection of members is heavily influenced by the managements.
These employees' councils are at times not mandated to discuss the main issues for the staff such as wages and working conditions.
Unlike registered trade unions, employees' councils have no legal standing before the law.

2007 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Bosnia and Herzegovina
The government continued to refuse to register the national trade union confederation, the SSSBiH, for clearly unjustifiable reasons.
There were at least 51 dismissals for trade union activities in 2006.
The president of the national confederation and his family received physical threats.
Freedom of association is included in the constitution and the labour law of both the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (the Federation) and the Republika Srpska (RS).
All workers, including migrant workers, are free to join trade unions, with the exception of the military.
In the Federation and the Republika discrimination against trade union members and leaders is prohibited.
Financial penalties are foreseen for anti-union discrimination against individuals, but there are no legal sanctions against employers who obstruct union organising.
Previous authorisation: The time limits prescribed in the legislation for the registration of trade unions are very short and, in the view of the ILO, equivalent to a system of prior authorisation.
Exceeding such limitations may lead to disproportionate penalties, such as the dissolution of the organisation in question or cancellation of its registration.
The law also regulates trade unions' internal procedures in great detail, restricting their freedoms.
The Minister of Justice of Bosnia and Herzegovina has the right to accept or reject trade union registration at the State level, and if no decision is made in 30 days, the registration is considered to be denied tacitly.
The 30 day deadline is rarely respected in practice.
In Republika Srpska trade unions have to pay court costs in order to be registered.
Restrictions on choosing trade union representatives: Company-level trade unions of the Republika Srpska must be entered into the Registry of the Ministry of Labour, War Veteran and Disability Protection.
The Registry's Rulebook of this registry stipulates that the authorised trade union representative must provide a certificate of his or her full-time open-ended employment at the company.
Employees on fixed-term contracts or part-timers cannot therefore be elected as trade union representatives.
In the meantime, should the employer fail to produce the certificate, there are neither sanctions nor alternative means to prove one's employment.
Strikes limited: The right to strike is recognised, and strikers are protected from retaliation.
There are some limitations on the right to strike.
In the Federation, a strike must be notified to the employer in writing, no later than ten days before the beginning of the strike.
The written notification must list the reasons for the strike, the locality, and the date and time at which the strike is to take place.
The law requires that "production maintenance" be ensured during a strike.
How this is to be done must be worked out in advance with the employer and announced no later than ten days before the strike is due to start.
If no agreement is reached and the union still launches a strike, then a strike will be declared unlawful by the court, trade unions can be fined up to 2,500 KM (EUR 1250), and workers may be punished.
As a result, quite a few strikes have been declared unlawful simply because the employer avoided reaching the "production maintenance" agreement.
The Confederation of Independent Trade Unions of BiH is campaigning to change this law.
Continued discrimination: Discrimination against union members and leaders still occurs and no sanctions against obstructing trade union activities have been imposed, despite the legal provisions.
Under the current privatisation process, trade unionists throughout BiH have been just as vulnerable to dismissal as other workers.
In some private companies, employees are warned they will be dismissed if they join a trade union.
Republika Srpska – situation gets worse: The Confederation of Independent Trade Unions of Republika Srpska reports that more and more violations of trade union rights take place, particularly in the private sector, and the employers would use any pretext to ban a trade union organisation.
The Confederation decided to declare the year 2007 a year for trade union rights, aiming at better protection.
There have been a few cases where trade unions managed to defend their activists against discrimination effectively using judicial and administrative remedies, but stronger protection is still needed.
Background: National elections took place in October 2006 for a government that would be the first to run the country without international supervision since the end of the 1992-1995 war.
Negotiations on the formation of a coalition government were ongoing at year end.
The country faces a challenge of high unemployment, a large grey economy and a backlogged court system, which has a negative impact on trade union rights.
SSSBiH still denied registration: The government has consistently denied registration at the BiH level to national confederations.
The failure to register the Confederation of Independent Trade Unions of Bonsia and Herzegovina, SSSBiH, on clearly unjustifiable grounds have created a spill-over effect: neither its branch unions nor the umbrella organisation for the national and entity level trade unions, KSBiH, could register.
Under the Law on Associations and Foundations, an association that has not been registered within the 30 day limit can be dissolved.
The SSSBiH believes that the failure to register it is for political reasons, and is an attempt to weaken the largest and strongest national trade union centre in the country.
For as long as the SSSBiH is not registered, it is not able to engage in collective bargaining at the national level.
SSSBiH president threatened: In spring the President of SSSBiH, Edhem Biber, and his family, received physical threats in connection with Mr. Biber's trade union activities.
Mr. Biber, a vocal advocate of the "revision of privatisation" to protect workers rights, had already been attacked in 2003.
As the threats resumed, the ITUC and the European Trade Union Confederation sent an official protest to the BiH Prime Minister Mr. Adnan Terzic on 3 April.
24 strike participants sacked: On 1 April a strike was launched at the "Agrokomerc" company in Velika Kladusa (Federation of BiH) as a protest against unpaid salaries and social contributions.
Although no court declared the strike illegal, on 6 July 24 trade union members were summarily dismissed for "taking part in an illegal strike, causing financial damage to the employer and failure to perform their working obligations".
A trade union leader was given a dismissal notice at the company gate, right after her unpaid leave has elapsed, in spite of the fact that the Ministry of Labour did not sanction her dismissal.
Since her social security contributions had not yet been paid, she was not entitled to medical aid.
The SSSBiH sued the company on 7 November in the name of the dismissed workers, but the trial has not started at the time of writing.
18 trade unionists dismissed: In November 2006 the management of AD "GRADENJE" in Uglevik (Republika Srpska) dismissed 18 workers who had demanded that the company paid outstanding salaries and social contributions; these workers also participated in a strike.
Trade unions asked the labour inspectorate to intervene.
The matter had not been resolved at the time of writing.
Fired for organising: On 2 February a trade union organisation was formed in the "Standard Turbe" company in Turbe (Federation of BiH) as an affiliate to the Independent Trade Union of Forestry and Wood Processing in BiH.
The employer then dismissed the trade union representative Mr. Ganic Vernes together with seven members of the new trade union presidency.
The employer did not ask for the approval of the Federal Ministry of Labour, which is required for the dismissal of a trade union official.
The dispute settlement procedure was still pending at the time of writing.
The trade union intended to file a lawsuit if the employer failed to give the trade unionists their jobs back.
Problems in the city of Zwornik: In February 2006 the management of AD "Inzinjering" in Zwornik (Republika Srpska) deducted trade union dues from members' salaries, but failed to transfer the money to the union's account.
Both the primary level and the municipal level trade union issued a written warning to the employer, but with no result by year end.
In another company, DOO "Aleksandrija", the management banned transfer of the membership fees, and a trade union member was transferred to a different post.
The 2006 Survey reported a case of trade union busting at the Birac factory in the same city.
The employer's campaign included threats, intimidation, manipulating trade union finances and establishing a "yellow" trade union.
Trade union chairman, Mr. Dragan Savic, was dismissed and appealed his dismissal in court in December 2005, although the trial did not begin until 12 December 2006.
The case has been adjourned several times due to the number of witnesses, and no solution was available at the time of writing.
2007 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Central African Republic
Limits on freedom of association: Freedom of association is guaranteed by the Constitution.
The Labour Code allows almost all workers to join trade unions, without prior authorisation.
However, state employees in high-level posts are not allowed to join a union.
A person who has lost the status of worker, either because s/he is unemployed or has retired, cannot in principle belong to a trade union or take part in its leadership or administration.
Trade union officers must belong to the occupation their union represents.
Complicated strike procedures: The right to strike is recognised in both the public and private sectors, but is curtailed by complicated procedures.
In the event of a dispute, there has to be conciliation between labour and management.
If conciliation does not work, an arbitration council must rule that the union and the employer failed to agree on valid demands, and only then may a strike be called.
If a union calls a strike, only its members can join in the action.
The government reserves the right to requisition workers if it is in the "general interest".
The Labour Code does not include sanctions against employers for acting against strikers.
Collective bargaining minimal: In the civil service, the government sets wages after consultation, but no negotiation with the unions.
In the private sector, collective bargaining has played a role in setting wages.
Police intimidation: Police surrounded the Labour Exchange (the national trade union headquarters) on 6 September, the day the Syndicat des Douanes de Centrafrique (SYNDOUCAF), affiliate of the USTC, called for an extraordinary general assembly.
The meeting was held to discuss the possibility of legal action against the government after the decision by President Bozize to dissolve the National Customs Administration.
As a result of the heavy police presence, only 72 customs officers showed up at the meeting.

2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Korea, Republic of
Police violence against strikers continued, resulting in serious injuries in several cases along with mass detentions.
Freedom of association is seriously restricted while the principal of voluntary collective bargaining essential to the respect for collective bargaining is almost totally ignored.
Since the election of the conservative government in early 2008, the Korean trade union movement has noted increasing repression of their activities and worsening treatment of its members.
While basic trade union rights are guaranteed in the Constitution, many excessive restrictions apply.
Numerous categories of public officials, as well as personnel dealing with trade unions or industrial relations, are denied union rights.
Dismissed workers are also prohibited from keeping their union membership, and non-members of unions are not eligible for trade union office.
Despite promises of reform, multiple unions are not allowed at the enterprise level.
Furthermore, public sector unionists are prohibited from engaging in "acts in contravention of their duties" when conducting union activities – a provision that is open to abuse – and may not be involved in any sort of "political activities".
Article 314 of the Criminal Code bars "obstruction of business", and enables employers to counteract union activities.
While the right to collective bargaining is secured, the procedures for involving third parties in negotiations are cumbersome.
Bargaining in the public sector is also limited, and laws and budgets prevail over any collective agreement.
The Minister of Labour has extensive powers to declare a situation of "Emergency Arbitration" in disputes relating to public services, which compels the union to enter mediation and, if mediation fails, binding arbitration.
In addition, all lawful strikes must be related to labour conditions, and all forms of industrial action is prohibited in the public sector.
The list of "essential services" exceeds the ILO definition.
In the second half of the year, tripartite discussions were held on the revision of the Trade Union and Labor Relation Adjustment Act (TULRAA).
Main discussion focused on the status of full-time union officials, union pluralism as well as precarious workers' and public workers' rights.
Mid-December, a debate started at the National Assembly on the revised Bill.
Amongst other issues, with the revision of the TULRAA, the enforcement of Union Pluralism is delayed for one and a half year.
The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) strongly criticised the proposed revised Bill.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
with the trade union movement.
Violations of trade union rights appear to
dismissals and unilateral cuts to wages and working conditions.
Worsening repression of union organising: A February 2009 fact-finding mission of the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC), Global Union Federation representatives and the Trade Union Advisory Committee (TUAC) of the OECD found supporting evidence that precarious workers in Korea continue to be denied the most basic rights, specifically rights to freedom of association, collective bargaining and collective action.
The mission also concluded that the trade union rights situation is deteriorating, and that the government has failed to implement recommendations made by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) to bring its laws into conformity with core ILO standards, including the use of Korea's unique "obstruction of business" clause (section 314 of the penal code) to severely limit legitimate trade union activity.
Repression of migrants union and crackdown on illegal migrants: Migrant workers are subject to serious abuses of labour rights.
While the laws offer them similar protection to local workers in terms of wages and basic conditions, in reality most are paid far less than their Korean counterparts and forced to work long hours.
The government continues to refuse to register the Migrants' Trade Union (MTU), and would not let it engage in trade union representation or bargaining.
The MTU was founded in April 2005 and is a member of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU).
Casualisation: Korea already has very high levels (more than 50%) of labour casualisation but according to unions, recent initiatives to privatise and merge public utilities is leading to increases in this figure, a rapid rise in laid off public employees, increased job instability and lowered working conditions for those remaining in employment with the additional goal of weakening the trade union movement.
The authorities use the violence that takes place in some demonstrations and strikes to justify the detention of trade union leaders however unions insist police action is unnecessarily provocative and disproportionately brutal.
Prosecutors are quick to issue arrest warrants as soon as workers go on strike, or sometimes the moment a strike is announced.
Police or security agencies mount surveillance operations, some of a sophisticated nature, in order to capture the strike leaders.
This surveillance is sometimes carried out on members of the trade unionists' families.
Unions' offices and telecommunications are routinely monitored.
"Paper unions": In a context where trade union pluralism is prohibited by law at the plant level, many employers have resorted to creating management-controlled unions, known as "paper unions".
As they are impossible to democratise from within, owing to management's hostility, and since the law forbids the organisation of alternative unions, workers are left with few, if any, rights and cannot engage in genuine collective bargaining.
The continued ban on union pluralism at the plant level reinforces the negative impact of these "paper unions" in denying workers their collective bargaining rights.
Civil Servant union leaders dismissed after attending rally: Fourteen leading members of the (then) three civil servant unions were dismissed and 37 other employees received demotions, suspensions, reprimands or pay cuts for participating in rallies in July.
A total of 105 union members were referred to disciplinary committee for their participation.
The rally was organised by opposition parties and activists over government plans to revise media laws and over various development plans.
Workers locked out after two day strike: On 11 August, Kumho Tires, the second largest tire manufacturer, imposed lockouts and barred workers access to three of its plants nationwide in response to strikes against the company's downsizing plan.
The unionists started the strike on 9 August over plans to dismiss over 18% of the workforce.
They complained that they had agreed to wage freezes and an effective wage cut two years ago whereas the company insisted on further cuts.
The unionists and management started a 20th session of negotiations, but failed to reach an agreement.
Government interference in union affairs: In September, the Korean Government Employees Union (KGEU) merged with two smaller unions, the Korean Democratic Government Employees Union and the Korean Court Workers Union, after direct ballots in the three unions.
The government was not satisfied with neither the merger nor the decision of the newly merged union to affiliate with the Korean Trade Union Congress (KTUC).
The Ministry of Public Administration and Security, the National Intelligence Service (MOPAS) and other groups attempted to stop the voting through directives banning all union activity during working hours in the days surrounding the ballot.
MOPAS stated that it planned to severely discipline civil servants who 'illegally' took part in the vote and file complaints with the police and prosecutors.
As well, it threatened to punish civil servants en masse if public sector unions joined KCTU collective actions under the Civil Service Law.
An emergency ministerial meeting publicly stated that the government would not permit unionists to use work time to carry out activities related to the vote and that the KCTU was engaged in a political activity and hence joining the union would be seen as a political and hence illegal act.
To note, the Korean Government Employees' Union (KGEU) has faced restrictions on its activities since it started.
Three affiliates of the Korean Federation of Public Services and Transportation Workers' Unions (KPTU), the Korean Railway Workers' Union (KRWU), the Korean Public & Social Service Workers' Union (KPSU)-KoGas Branch, and the Korean Powerplant Workers Union organised a joint response to the government action and other measures promoting privatisation and in non-compliance with current laws on trade union rights.

2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Trinidad and Tobago
Trade unions faced resistance when carrying out legitimate union activities.
Two attempts to decertify unions were made by public sector employers, and a skirmish followed a picketing outside the seat of Parliament.
The term "essential services" was broadly applied to exclude workers from union organising.
The right to strike is restricted.
Although basic trade union rights are guaranteed, a number of excessive restrictions apply.
The 1972 Industrial Relations Act allows workers to form or join unions of their own choosing.
The right to collective bargaining is also guaranteed, but the law only provides for mandatory recognition of a trade union when it represents 51% or more of the workers in a specified bargaining unit.
Furthermore, all collective agreements must be for a maximum of five years and a minimum of three years, which makes it almost impossible for workers on short-term contracts to be covered by such agreements.
While the right to strike is recognised – except for members of the teaching service and employees of the Central Bank – it is coupled with many restrictions.
Strikes can be prohibited where the government considers that the national interest is threatened, or at the request of one party provided that the strike is not declared by a majority union.
Also, lawful strikes can only be called over unresolved "interest" disputes, i.e.
concerning the formulation of terms and conditions of employment.
All strikes are banned in "essential services", the list of which exceeds the ILO definition by including, for example, the public school bus service.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Organising right has limited scope: Although the law states that workers can form and join trade unions, in practice everyone working in so-called "essential services", which include domestic workers, drivers, gardeners and others, are not recognised as workers and so cannot legally join unions.
It is estimated that just 20% of the workforce are union members.
The problems with obtaining union recognition continued owing to the slow handling of cases by the state.
Collective bargaining hampered: Many unions had their collective bargaining blocked by employers' delaying tactics.
The state, too, repeatedly refused to negotiate collective agreements with public sector unions.
Government unwilling to amend labour law: The government has continued to refuse to amend its legislation on essential services and collective bargaining to bring it into line, at least, with ILO conventions.
Police repression, union leader arrested in picket: Trade union leader David Abdullah of the Federation of Independent Trade Unions was arrested and several people were injured in a picket on December 18th.
The around 100 protesters had gathered outside the seat of Parliament to protest against a proposed property tax bill.
The police abruptly ended the picket and beat the protesters with batons, as the leaders refused to "tone it down" and dissolve the picket.
Abdullah was charged with "obstructing free passageway", but was released from jail one hour later on $500 bail.
The Acting Police Commissioner later admitted that the police officers may have used excessive force during the fracas.

2009 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Korea, Republic of
South Korea has still not ratified the core ILO conventions on trade union rights and anti-union repression persists.
Police violence against strikers continued, resulting in serious injuries in several cases.
Two leaders of the Migrants' Trade Union were arrested and deported.
Several KCTU leaders were arrested and its president remains in prison.
Law recognises union rights for some civil servants: According to the law on the Establishment and Operation of Public Officials' Trade Unions that went into effect on 28 January 2006, civil servants are allowed to legally organise within administrative units predefined by the law.
However, there are numerous categories of public officials who are still denied union rights, including managers, human resources personnel, personnel dealing with trade unions or industrial relations and certain public servants including the army, the police, fire-fighters, politically-appointed officials and high level public officials.
A union member can work on a full-time basis for the union but only with the authority of the employer and while taking unpaid leave.
In its June 2007 report, the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association asked the government to ensure that all public servants who are entitled, based on international standards, to form their own associations to defend their interests, are granted that right.
Civil servants have the right to collective bargaining, but the subjects of negotiation are limited to matters concerning trade unions, members' pay and welfare and other working conditions.
Hence, trade unions cannot address other economic and social issues.
Law and budgets prevail over Collective Bargaining Agreements (CBAs), which makes it possible for the government to propose a budget that will nullify them.
Trade unions can file complaints about unfair labour practices, but no sanctions for such practices are foreseen.
The law maintains a ban on industrial action, such as strikes and work slow-downs.
Law on irregular workers erodes protection: In November 2006, the government pushed through Parliament a law that allows expanded use of temporary contracts for workers for up to two years.
Such contracts deprive workers of certain rights under the law and entail less advantageous working conditions and less pay.
Employers are also able to hire these contract workers without significant constraints, increasing flexibility in employment and reducing the leverage of unionised workforces to bargain effectively with their employer.
The unions are afraid that the impact of this new law will be to make temporary contracts the most widespread form of employment and to undermine existing job security.
There are many examples of this trend, including in the Korea Telecom company, the hotel industry, taxi phone services for disabled people in Seoul, and the Hyundai Heavy Industries and Seoul Grand Park companies.
All those companies have a large number of unionised workers, employed without contracts, whom the management has identified as union activists and whose contracts were not renewed when they expired.
Right to strike – denied to too many workers: The 1997 Trade Union and Labour Relations Adjustment Act (TULRAA) and public service legislation ban strikes by people working for the central government or local governments, and by those involved in the production of military goods.
The law sets out a long list of "essential services" where the right to strike can be heavily restricted by the imposition of mandatory mediation and arbitration procedures.
In its June 2007 report, the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association again asked the government to limit any restrictions of the right to strike to public servants exercising authority in the name of the State and essential services in the strict sense of the term.
Under the 1999 law on the establishment and operation of trade unions for teachers, members of this profession do not have the right to strike.
According to the government, this restriction is based on the pretext of protecting students' right to learn.
Emergency powers to impose compulsory arbitration in public services: The TULRAA also gives the Minister of Labour extensive powers to declare a situation of "Emergency Arbitration", which immediately halts all industrial action and compels the union to enter mediation.
If the mediation is unsuccessful, the Labour Relations Committee (LRC) can compel the labour dispute to enter a process of compulsory, binding arbitration.
The only limitations on this power are that the dispute must be related to public services, and the Minister must decide that the nature of the disruption could make the economy worse or disrupt "normal life.
"
Interference in internal trade union affairs: The TULRAA initially prohibited employers from remunerating union leaders from 1 January 2002.
Unionists strongly protested against this restriction, stating that this matter should be left to the discretion of negotiations between the employer and union, and succeeded in delaying implementation of this provision until 2006.
In a tripartite deal signed on 11 September, implementation of this provision was deferred until 2009, but there was no change made in the law to delete this measure.
The ILO Committee on Freedom of Association noted in its 309th report that "the prohibition of the payment of full-time union officials by employers is a matter which should not be subject to legislative interference" and "therefore calls upon the government to repeal section 24(2) of the TULRAA".
The law also bans dismissed workers from remaining members of a union and states that non-union members are not eligible for trade union office.
In June 2007 the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association asked the government to repeal the provisions of the law that allow this interference.
The TULRAA provided for the immediate establishment of trade union pluralism at the industrial and national level from 1997, but implementation of union pluralism at the company level has been repeatedly delayed.
Originally, the formation of competing unions in workplaces was to be allowed by 2002, but then the ban was extended twice until 2009.
In its June 2007 recommendations, the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association asked the government to take rapid steps to legalise trade union pluralism at the enterprise or establishment level.
Criminalising union activity – "Obstruction of business" in penal code: Employers used Article 314 of the Criminal Code, which bars "Obstruction of Business", to systematically harass and seek the incarceration of union leaders and to try to bankrupt unions.
Despite the abusive and discriminatory way in which Article 314 was used against workers, the government did nothing to intervene or clarify the law.
The charge of "obstruction of business" was indiscriminately used by vengeful employers against union leaders who were seeking to bargain collectively, hold meetings, conduct strikes and pickets and carry out other core trade union activities.
Employers also commonly used the government's prosecution of workers under this law to justify disciplinary measures, including dismissals.
Special economic zones: The law on Special Economic Zones (SEZs) of July 2003 contains preferential provisions for foreign companies investing in the SEZs.
It exempts them from many national regulations on the protection of the environment and labour standards.
It is feared that this will result in further violations of workers' rights and make it easy to hire "irregular" workers, who will have little or no protection.
Migrant workers: The Act on Employment of Foreign Labourers, and the Employment Permit System, allow employers to violate migrant workers' trade union rights with impunity.
Migrant workers are permitted only three years' work before they must return to their own country and are strictly forbidden from changing their employer during their stay in South Korea.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2008
Background: The arrival of a conservative government led to a chilling of relations with the trade union movement.
The authorities use the violence that takes place in some demonstrations and strikes to justify the detention of trade union leaders.
Unions insist police action is unnecessarily provocative and disproportionately brutal.
Prosecutors are quick to issue arrest warrants as soon as workers go on strike, or sometimes the moment a strike is announced.
Police or security agencies mount surveillance operations, some of a sophisticated nature, in order to capture the strike leaders.
This surveillance is sometimes carried out on members of the trade unionists' families.
Unions' offices and telecommunications are routinely monitored.
"Paper unions": In a context where trade union pluralism is prohibited by law at the plant level, many employers have resorted to creating management-controlled unions, known as "paper unions".
As they are impossible to democratise from within, owing to management's hostility, and since the law forbids the organisation of alternative unions, workers are left with few, if any, rights and cannot engage in genuine collective bargaining.
The continued ban on union pluralism at the plant level reinforces the negative impact of these "paper unions" in denying workers their collective bargaining rights.
Migrants' Trade Union still battling for recognition: The government continues to refuse to register the Migrants' Trade Union (MTU), which was founded in April 2005 and is a member of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU), and would not let it engage in trade union representation or bargaining.
On 1 February 2007 the Seoul High Court ruled that all migrant workers have the right to form and join unions, no matter what their legal status in South Korea.
The Ministry of Labour appealed the decision, however.
On 19 March 2008, the new President of South Korea, Lee Myeong-bak, stated that a trade union of illegal workers could not be tolerated (his statement was clearly referring to the MTU).
Strikers attacked at Kiryung: The International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF) reports that in October 12 people were arrested, one was hospitalised and many more were injured by police and the thugs hired by Kiryung Electronics (key producer of Sirius Satellite Radios, which has exclusive partnerships with major automakers including BMW, Chrysler, Daimler, Volkswagen, Ford, Volvo, and Toyota) to break a strike by the KMWU.
The protest had begun three years earlier, triggered by the dismissal of women workers recruited by a temporary employment agency.
They had joined the KMWU in July 2005, but the company had quickly threatened them with dismissal.
The violent incidents took place in 2008, just a few months after the ILO's Committee on Freedom of Association had issued a stern recommendation to the Korean government to "take all necessary measures to promote collective bargaining over the terms and conditions of employment of subcontracted workers in the metal sector, in particular at ... Kiryung Electronics.
"
Prison sentences for teachers' union leaders: On 15 July, a court in Seoul sentenced five leaders of the Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union (KTU) to between six and 12 months in prison for trade union action in 2006, in particular a peaceful and legal strike organised in July and November 2006.
The five leaders concerned were the union's then President, Ms. Jan Hye-ok, and Vice-President, Mr. Cha Sang-chil, and three executive members, Mr. Ha Jong-su, Mr. Jang In-kwon and Mr. Jeong Jae-wook.
On appeal, the Seoul High Court reduced the sentences of four of the five leaders to fines.
It upheld the 12-month prison sentenced handed down to former KTU President, Ms. Jang Hye-ok, who lost her job.
A total of 28 KTU members were ordered to pay fines, ranging from about 800 to 7,000 dollars, and were given pay cuts.
Violence against peaceful sit-in: On 11 March a 182-day sit-in by workers at Koskom (which distributes market data for the Korea Stock Exchange) to protest against the use of irregular workers, was violently broken up under the supervision of hundreds of anti-riot police.
Several workers were seriously wounded in the attack and their tents destroyed.
At the end of 2008 management reached an agreement with the union to end the labour dispute, which had lasted 475 days.
Anti-unionism at Allianz Life Korea: 850 employees at Allianz Life Korea (a subsidiary of the German insurance multinational) went on strike in February to protest about the violation of the collective agreement signed in 2006.
Management reacted by imposing a lock-out.
87 sales managers were dismissed for taking part in the strike.
The union's President and one of his colleagues were arrested "for obstructing Allianz's economic activities", just before they were due to go to Germany in the hope of discussing their problems at the Allianz head office.
After a long struggle by the union at Allianz Life Korea and, at the international level, by UNI, a provisional agreement was reached between the union and management in September.
Working overtime is to be avoided.
Whenever it is unavoidable, extra compensation is at stake - minimally the basic hourly wage plus all additional benefits you are entitled to.
Convention 155 (1981) on Occupational Safety and Health.
More Conventions deal with very specific Occupational Safety hazards, such as asbestos and chemicals.
They are not dealt with here.
Whenever you are disabled due to an occupational disease or accident, you ought to receive a somewhat higher benefit than when the cause is not work related.
At workplaces equal pay for men and women for work of equal value is a must, regardless of marital status.
Pay inequality based on religion, race or ethnic background is also forbidden.
A transparent remuneration system and the clear matching of pay and position are in place and help to prevent wage discrimination.
Trade unions are entitled to negotiate with employers on term of employment without hindrance.
The freedom of a trade union to negotiate with employers to try and conclude collective agreements is protected.
(The ILO has a special procedure for handling complaints from unions about violation of this principle).
Freedom to join a union an being active in the trade union outside working hours
Freedom of association means freedom to join a trade union.
This is part of the fundamental human rights.
Employees may not be put at a disadvantage when they are active in the trade union outside working hours.

2009 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Trinidad and Tobago
No changes in labour law.
The restrictions on strikes remained in place and the State occasionally intervened to stop them.
The government continued to refuse to amend the labour legislation.
Freedom of association: The 1972 Industrial Relations Act (IRA) allows workers to form or join unions of their own choosing.
The law also provides for the mandatory recognition of a trade union when it represents 51% or more of the workers in a specified bargaining unit, once this has been verified by the Registration, Recognition and Certification Board (R.R.C.B).
Teachers and public servants are excluded from the scope of the Act but are covered by separate legislation.
Collective bargaining restricted: The IRA establishes the right of collective bargaining.
To obtain bargaining rights, a union must have the support of an absolute majority of workers.
Furthermore, collective agreements must be for a maximum of five years and a minimum of three years, making it almost impossible for workers on short-term contracts to be covered by such agreements.
Heavy limitations on the right to strike: Industrial action is strictly regulated by the IRA, which stipulates that strikes may only be over unresolved "interest" disputes, i.e., concerning the formulation of terms and conditions of employment.
Strikes are banned in essential services, which are too broadly defined by ILO standards, including, for example, the public school bus service.
Strikes can also be prohibited at the request of one party if they are not declared by a majority union or when the government considers that the national interest is threatened.
There is a penalty of up to 18 months' imprisonment.
EPZs: The same labour laws apply in the export processing zones as in the rest of the country.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2008
Organising right has a limited scope: Although the law states that workers can form and join trade unions, in practice everyone working in the so-called "essential services", which include domestic workers, drivers, gardeners and others, are not recognised as workers and so cannot legally join unions.
It is estimated that just 20 percent of the workforce are union members.
The problems with obtaining union recognition continued owing to the slow handling of cases by the state.
Collective bargaining hampered: Many unions had their collective bargaining blocked by employers' delaying tactics.
The state, too, repeatedly refused to negotiate collective agreements with public sector unions.
Government unwilling to amend labour law: The government has continued to refuse to amend its legislation on essential services and collective bargaining to bring it into line, at least, with ILO conventions.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - United Arab Emirates
Migrant workers are frequently the victims of serious exploitation.
The government has taken some measures to combat abuse, but only the creation of independent trade unions would guarantee the respect of workers' rights.
Trade union rights are severely restricted.
There is not much room in the law for trade union activities.
The current Labour Law does not permit trade unions, although workers are allowed to associate for the furtherance of common goals and interests.
Public sector workers, as well as domestic workers and anyone working in the agricultural sector, are not covered by the labour legislation, and the EPZs have their own departments to deal with workers' issues.
The right to collective bargaining is not recognised in law, however workers' representatives have some say in settling disputes.
All wages are fixed in individual contracts that are reviewed by the authorities.
Furthermore, the right to strike is not specifically recognised, and the Labour Minister has the power to intervene to end a strike and force workers to go back to work.
Public sector workers, security guards and migrant workers are not allowed to strike, and migrants who participate in or provoke a strike "without a valid reason" can be banned from working for a year and can even have their work permits cancelled and be deported.
A draft Labour Law released for comments in 2007 does not improve the trade union rights situation in any significant way.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
The government has repeatedly announced that the defence of migrant workers' rights is one of its biggest priorities.
The most simple solution for guaranteeing the respect of these rights would be to allow the creation of trade unions, but the government prefers to act alone, stepping up labour inspections and checks on the payment of salaries.
Migrant workers often risk expulsion if they try to create trade unions.
Little improvement for domestic workers: In 2007, the government introduced a standard contract for foreign domestic workers that abolished commission fees by recruitment agencies and provided for decent living and working conditions.
In practice, however, many migrant domestic workers suffer the same types of serious abuse faced in other countries in the region: confinement in the employers' home, physical and sexual abuse, unpaid salaries, etc.
In August, says Human Rights Watch, the Philippines government paid to fly home 44 Filipinas who had been living for months at a shelter.
The women were among 127 Filipinas, mostly domestic workers, who fled their workplace after complaining of mistreatment, long working hours, insufficient food, and non-payment of salaries.
Human Rights Watch accused labour-supply agencies, construction companies and repressive laws for being responsible for the abuse, which in some cases amounts to forced labour.
The report recognises that the government has moved to improve housing conditions and ensure the timely payment of wages in recent years, but adds that it has not done enough to tackle the root causes of abuse: unlawful recruiting fees, broken promises of wages, and a sponsorship system that gives an employer virtually complete power over their workers.
HRW noted that all the Saadiyat workers it spoke to said they were frightened to complain to the authorities, go on strike or organise trade unions because they thought they would be dismissed and sent home.
2009 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - United Arab Emirates
The new draft labour law does not give the right to join unions or to collective bargaining.
A new law establishes an employment contract for domestic servants, and measures have been announced to improve migrant workers' working conditions.
Thousands of migrant workers in the construction sector were arrested or deported following many strikes.
Freedom of association and right to collective bargaining – Prohibition: The current Labour Law does not permit trade unions, although workers are allowed to associate for the furtherance of common goals and interests.
Draft law falls far short of ILO standards: The draft labour law released for comment on the Internet in March 2007 falls far short of ILO norms.
It does not allow workers to form or join independent trade unions and does not give them the right to bargaining collectively.
It also punishes striking workers.
It fails to protect migrant workers by failing to incorporate a 2001 ruling that prohibited employers from confiscating employees' passports.
Right to strike – banned in the public sector: Public sector workers and national security guards are not allowed to strike.
The law does not provide for the right to strike for other workers but does not forbid it either.
The Labour Minister is allowed to intervene to end a strike and to force workers to go back to work.
Ill-treatment of migrant workers: Migrant workers are banned from going on strike.
Those who do, or provoke one "without a valid reason" can be banned from working for a year, and if they are absent from work for more than seven days without a valid reason, can have their work permits cancelled and be deported.
Employment contracts for foreign domestic workers: The government has established a standard contract for foreign domestic workers that abolishes commission fees by recruitment agencies and provides for decent living and working conditions.
In the case of India housemaids, the government reached a bilateral agreement with the Indian government that maids must be paid a minimum wage and offered a minimum set of working conditions.
Government to improve pay and working conditions: In response to the many construction workers' strikes in 2007, the government created a salary review committee consisting of labour ministry officials and construction company representatives.
Export processing zones (EPZs): Although the EPZs are supposed to comply with the Labour Law, they are not regulated by the Ministry of Labour.
Each zone has its own department to deal with workers' issues.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2008
Background: Migrants, most of whom come from South Asia, account for between 85% and 95% of the workforce.
They include 1.5 million expatriate Indians (42.5% of the total labour force and 65% are in the blue-collar category).
A large number of them work as contract labour in the booming construction industry.
In addition, there are an estimated 300,000 illegal workers.
Strikes and demonstrations are becoming more frequent and violent as thousands of workers in the construction industry are forced to live and work in harsh conditions.
Furthermore, many have to wait months to be paid, and the work is very hazardous.
In the light of these events, government and business representatives met with India officials and trade unions and civil society groups on 18 June to discuss how to ensure these workers were employed under humane conditions.
Goodwill gestures by the authorities: Despite making arrests and deportations, the authorities have established two bodies, the Permanent Committee for Labour Affairs and the police authorities' Human Rights Department.
These apparently receive thousands of complaints and enable employees to receive back pay.
However, government announcements that it intended to bring in reforms such as a special Labour Court and the recruitment of a large number of Labour Inspectors have come to nothing.
Migrant workers exploited: Legal workers are bound by the sponsor system, which puts them at the mercy of their employers and recruitment agencies.
They can be deported if they try to organise trade unions.
Migrant workers jailed and deported: On 14 March, 45 Indian construction workers were sentenced to six month's imprisonment followed by deportation for striking for better working conditions.
They were among 1,000 who were arrested, after 2,400 labourers held a protest outside the Drake and Scull Group about the low level of monthly wages, which stand at US$163.
New Zealand’s employment law includes two types of employment rights: some set the minimum pay and conditions employees must receive, while the others set the way employees should be treated in the work environment.
Written employment agreements have been mandatory in New Zealand since 2000.
These can either be individual or collective agreements.
To help business owners and managers with creating employment agreements, the Department of Labour has created the Employment Agreement Builder .
The law requires that employer and employee both act in good faith towards each other.
Employers must not discourage employees from participating in collective bargaining or being covered by a collective agreement.
As of 1 March, 2009, New Zealand small businesses with fewer than 20 employees have the right to dismiss an employee within his or her first 90 days of employment without the employee having the right to lodge a personal grievance case against the employer for unfair dismissal, as part of the Employment Relations Amendment Act .
If a consensus cannot be reached, the next step is to involve a mediator or a labour inspector.
The service is free of charge.
If mediation or the labour inspection still doesn’t solve the problem, the employer or employee can opt to take the matter to the Employment Relations Authority or the Employment Court.
2009 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - United Kingdom
Restrictions on the right to strike remain in place.
British Airways have been using EU law to prevent a strike.
The retail giant Marks & Spencer sacked a worker after he talked to the press about the company's plan to cap redundancy pay.
Freedom of Association: The Trade Union and Labour Relations Consolidation Act (TULR(C)A 1992) sets out most trade union rights, including the right of workers to form and join trade unions of their choice.
The Employment Relations Act (ERA) 1999 also contains provisions governing trade union rights.
In 2004, a further Employment Relations Act was introduced, which strengthened existing legislation and created new protections.
On 13 November, the TULR(C)A was amended to allow a trade union to exclude a person on the basis of his or her membership, or former membership, of a political party.
This followed the 2007 decision of the European Court of Human Rights arguing that UK law was in breach of Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which upheld the right of the ASLEF trade union to be able to choose its members in accordance with the union's values.
ASLEF's policy has always been to stand for equality and to "expose the obnoxious practices" of nationalistic political movements.
An activist of the British National Party (BNP) who distributed anti-Islamic leaflets was expelled from the union in 2002.
The Trades Union Congress (TUC, the national trade union centre) continues to take the view that the new laws do not fully comply with Article 11 of the ECHR, however.
Statutory recognition: Employers with 21 or more employees must recognise unions that can prove that a majority of employees want a union to represent them.
A trade union may apply to the Central Arbitration Committee (CAC), a statutory body, for formal recognition, and the CAC has the power to compel an employer to recognise a union for the purposes of collective bargaining.
Support for recognition must be shown either by majority membership, or via a workforce ballot, in which 40 per cent of those eligible to vote must vote in favour.
A union has to show at least 10 per cent membership in the bargaining unit to trigger a ballot.
Collective agreements are voluntary agreements and are not legally binding.
Trade unions have traditionally supported the voluntary approach.
The 2004 ERA protects workers against being offered incentives by their employer not to become members of a trade union, not to take part in the activities of their union or make use of its services, and to give up having their terms and conditions of employment determined by a collective agreement negotiated by their union.
Workers are also protected against dismissal or other forms of reprisal for making use of the services of their trade union.
The Act protects the role of unions in grievance and disciplinary hearings by giving the workers the right not only to be accompanied by a union representative but also for the representative to speak on the worker's behalf, a point which had been unclear under the 1999 ERA.
This rule applies even if there is no trade union at the company where the employees work.
Strikes allowed – with limitations: Strikes must be confined to workers and their own employers, the dispute must be wholly or mainly about employment related matters, and the decision must be based on a secret ballot of the workers concerned.
If striking workers are dismissed within 12 weeks of taking part in a legal strike, they can claim unfair dismissal.
In most instances, after the end of a 12 week or longer period, where there has been a lock out, employees can be fired legally for participating in lawful strike action.
However, the 2004 ERA places additional duties on employers to try to resolve the dispute, through conciliation.
Failure to do so can mean that dismissals after the protected period are unlawful.
Trade Union Freedom Bill – greater protection of the right to strike: Further to a resolution adopted at its 2005 Congress, the TUC has been seeking the adoption of a Trade Union Freedom Bill.
The proposals in the bill include improved protection from dismissal for workers taking part in industrial action, simplification of the complex regulations governing strike ballots and notices, strengthening the bar on the use of agency workers to replace striking workers, revising the law on industrial action injunctions and modernisation of the definition of an industrial dispute.
The TUC notes that despite important changes in industrial relations law since 1997, UK trade unions members have fewer rights to take industrial action than in 1906, when the current system was introduced.
Jersey: The Employment Relations (Jersey) Law 2007 has been the subject of much controversy since it was adopted in 2005 and eventually came into force in January 2007.
The Act has formed the basis of a complaint to the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association (CFA) in relation to various provisions concerning registration procedures; possible sanctions and penalties for legitimate trade union activity; definitions of "collective agreement" and "employment dispute" which limit the ability of unions to bargain collectively and take industrial action; and compulsory arbitration.
The CFA has found substance in this complaint and urged the government seek the solution in consultation with the social partners.
The government insists, however, that many restrictions criticised by the CFA, such as the ban on solidarity strikes, are necessary.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2008
Collective bargaining: The most outstanding feature of the statutory trade union recognition scheme has been a significant increase in voluntary agreements, although even today only about one third of the workforce are covered by collective agreements, about half the European average.
Anti-union tactics: Following reports in 2002 and 2006 on difficulties encountered by trade unions to secure recognition from employers, a 2007 survey of 583 human resource professionals and 524 union representatives conducted by the TUC and Personnel Today concluded that according to 92% of the unionists and 36% of the HR professionals, being a union representative could seriously damage one's career prospects.
In July 2008, the government signed a joint statement with trade unions, business and voluntary organisations providing for a set of rights for employees of government contractors, including access to information about trade unions.
Marks & Spencer fires a whistleblower: On 3 September, Tony Goode, a member of the GMB trade union at Marks & Spencer (where he had been working for 25 years) was dismissed for revealing the company's plan to cut redundancy pay.
However, Goode only spoke to the press after he had tried in vain to resolve the issue internally.
GMB suspected that the company had access to Goode's private mobile phone records.
Even though the leaked information was not classified as confidential, Goode was suspended and then sacked.
After an unsuccessful appeal to the company, GMB decided to represent Goode in the industrial tribunal.
Unite wins recognition at Leicester Paper Company: "Unite", the country's largest trade union (affiliated to the TUC and ICEM), has been organising workers at the Leicester Paper Company in very hostile circumstances.
The company tried to avoid recognising the union by constantly including new workers in the proposed bargaining unit and changing various employment contracts.
On 14 July, after two hearings, the Central Arbitration Committee granted Unite recognition and obliged the employer to start negotiations within one month.
Workers forced into self-employment and sacked for turning to a trade union: Six Kosovo construction workers worked on a contract that was transferred to FM Conway Ltd. The new contractor put pressure on the men to work on a self-employed basis.
When they refused to do so and involved the Union of Construction, Allied Trades and Technicians (UCATT), they were dismissed on trumped-up charges.
UCATT planned to represent the Kosovans in this unfair dismissal case in court.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Timor Leste (East Timor)
The enforcement of labour legislation remained weak.
Organising is curtailed by anti-union practices and the lack of knowledge about trade union rights.
In June East Timor ratified four fundamental ILO Conventions, including Conventions 87 and 98.
The right to strike remained limited in law, however.
Although fundamental trade union rights are guaranteed, areas of concern exist in the labour law.
Freedom of association is secured in the Constitution and the Labour Code, and on 16 June 2009 Timor Leste ratified the two ILO core conventions on trade union rights.
However, foreign nationals are not allowed to participate in the "administrative or social organs of a union".
While termination of employment for union activity is explicitly prohibited in law, the protection is partly undermined by another provision which allows for financial compensation in lieu of reinstatement if the employer refuses to reinstate the worker.
Furthermore, trade union activities are hampered by provisions in the Freedom, Assembly and Demonstration Act.
Protests are not allowed within 100 metres of certain buildings, including government offices and diplomatic missions, as well as of infrastructure such as ports and key parts of transportation.
The Minister has an absolute right to prohibit or restrict a strike in "essential services".
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
High unemployment and mainly unstructured economy are barriers to organising: The great majority of East Timor's working age population are self-employed or work in subsistence agriculture.
Given the difficulties workers face in finding a job in the formal economy, few want to risk returning to poverty by challenging an employer's prerogatives on trade union rights, or wages and conditions of work.
The problem is compounded by their very limited knowledge of trade union rights.
Limited enforcement of legislation: Many employers, especially outside the capital city of Dili, do everything they can to prevent workers exercising their right to form and join trade unions and to go on strike, for example through dismissals.
2007 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Timor Leste (East Timor)
East Timor's Constitution and laws support trade union rights, but new laws on assembly and immigration have eroded some of these rights, and there are restrictions on the right to strike.
Enforcement of laws remained a problem, compounded by high levels of poverty and illiteracy, and a huge informal sector which accounts for over 80 per cent of the working population.
Foreign companies operating in East Timor took advantage of weak enforcement and the desperate situation of workers, despite the Timor Lorosa'e Trade Union Confederation's efforts to defend them.
Constitution guarantees right to form unions and right to strike: The right to form unions is guaranteed by Article 52 of the Constitution which unequivocally states: "Every worker has the right to form or join trade unions ... in defence of his or her rights and interests.
" In the same Article, it adds that "trade unions and trade union associations shall be independent of the State and employers.
" The constitution also guarantees (article 51) the right to strike, provided that minimum services are provided to meet essential needs, and prohibits lockouts.
Ten workers are required to form a union, and all trade unions must register with an Office of the Registrar of Trade Unions and Employer Organisations (ORTEU), operating under the Ministry of Labour and Community Reintegration.
Trade unions are allowed to amalgamate freely if more than 50 per cent of each of the unions' membership agree to do so, and that amalgamation is subsequently registered with the registrar.
The law explicitly outlaws termination of employment in retaliation for past or present union activity, although this protection is partly undermined by another provision which explicitly accepts the principle of allowing for financial compensation in lieu of reinstatement when "the employer refuses to reinstate the worker.
"
Restrictions on the right to strike: Before going on strike, a union must provide prior written notice to the employer and to the Governments' Conciliation and Mediation Service at least ten days before taking such action.
The Minister is given an absolute right to prohibit or restrict a strike if it involves an industry or sector classified as "Essential Services.
" The law explicitly includes essential public transport, ambulances and hospitals, electricity and police in this category, but also adds that other sectors can be similarly classified as essential if their interruption causes "massive disruption" or "danger to the public".
The law also opens up a channel for employer interference in this determination by allowing any "party" to apply for a restriction on the right to strike to the tri-partite National Labour Board.
If the board agrees, the case proceeds to arbitration.
High unemployment, limited formal sector serve as barriers: The government's 2004 census found that 88 per cent of East Timor's working population are either in "self-employment or subsistence farming.
" Clearly, given the difficulties workers face in finding a job in the formal sector, few want to risk returning to poverty by challenging an employer's prerogatives on trade union rights, or wages and conditions of work.
The national labour congress, the Timor Lorosa'e Trade Union Confederation (TLTUC/KSTL) informed ILO's Bureau for Workers' Activities that a "lack of understanding from the East Timor workers about unions is one of the major problems that unions are facing.
"
Labour Relations Board established, but not active: The Labour Relations Board was formed in January 2004 under the authority of Article 27 of the Labour Code.
Established to "hear all labour disputes ... with the employment or non-employment, or the terms of employment, or the conditions of work ... ", the Board was largely inactive, and unable to adequately perform the dispute-resolution duties as authorised in the law.
As a result, the TLTUC and its affiliates have played the primary role in representing workers in efforts to resolve disputes.

2008 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Congo, Democratic Republic of
Demands for the payment of wage arrears have repeatedly led to the arrest and detention of trade union officials, sometimes for several weeks.
A trade unionist sustained bullet wounds during an industrial dispute in the mining sector.
The new Constitution of February 2006 guarantees freedom of association and the right to strike.
The legislation grants all categories of workers, except for members of the armed forces, the police and the security services, the right to organise.
No prior authorisation is required to set up a trade union.
The right to strike is recognised, although unions must have prior consent and adhere to lengthy mandatory arbitration and appeal procedures.
The law prohibits employers from retaliating against strikers.
Trade union rights in practice and Violations in 2007
Nine trade unionists dismissed in the press sector ... : In February, nine trade union representatives at the private television channel Raga, in Kinshasa, were dismissed "for serious misconduct" by Raga Director Parag Bhimjihany.
The union had recently organised a strike to demand better working conditions.
A labour inspector authorised the dismissal, without prior notice, of the nine union activists.
During the night of 29 May, a few hours after the journalists at Raga had held another work stoppage to protest against the retaliatory dismissal of their colleagues, a group of armed men fired a shot into the bedroom of Raga union President Fabien Lumbala, one of the nine victimised strikers.
In June, the dismissals were revoked by a decree of the Labour Minister ordering the immediate reinstatement of all the workers except Fabien Lumbala, who was suspended for 15 days "for poor leadership".
Arrest of three activists at Kinshasa International Fair: Jean-Benoît Ntando, General Secretary of the Organisation des travailleurs unis du Congo (OTUC), which is affiliated to ICEM, and two other activists were arrested on 22 May during a demonstration organised by the employees of Kinshasa International Fair (FIKIN).
They were released two days later.
The OTUC's main demand concerned wage arrears which, despite the employers' promises, in some cases dated back 16 months.
The union was also protesting against the unfair dismissal of several workers and management's refusal to consult the union on important decisions, in contravention of the company's articles of association.
Rights not respected in the civil service: The government has always refused to allow union elections in the civil service, though the union centres have many members working in it.
Only public enterprises organise such elections.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Hong Kong SAR (China)
Workers and unions continue to have little opportunity to defend their rights in practice.
Collective bargaining rights are regularly ignored.
Overall, the laws pertaining to trade union rights are lacking.
Although the Basic Law, which is essentially the constitution of Hong Kong, contains provisions guaranteeing freedom of association, the right to organise and the right to strike, no laws have been implemented to secure the effective application of these fundamental rights.
While the law protects workers against dismissal for trade union activities, it does not cover other forms of anti-union discrimination.
A trade union may not use its funds as it wishes, as particularly the use of funds for political ends or for transfer to foreign trade union organisations is restricted in law.
Furthermore, only those currently or previously employed in the trade, industry or occupation of the union concerned are permitted to become union officers.
The right to strike is limited, as the Public Order Ordinance authorises the use of force to break up strike pickets and demonstrations, and employers can seek an injunction order to suppress workers' protests.
There is also little protection for striking workers, as the law only ensures that, were a worker to be dismissed for participating in a strike, s/he would have the right to sue the employer for compensation.
There is no legal entitlement to reinstatement.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Background: The economic crisis has increased lay-offs and pay cuts for many workers, and 2009 saw several high profile strikes.
The struggle for universal suffrage has dominated Hong Kong's political life since the government's failure in 2003 to introduce a new security law.
Legislative Committee elections in 2008 returned more radical pro-democratic legislators in the directly elected seats while those elected through the so-called "functional constituencies" continued to return mainly pro-Beijing representatives.
June 2009 saw the largest vigil for the 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre since 1989 itself, while the annual democracy march on 1 July, the date of the handover to Chinese sovereignty, saw a turnout of around 75,000.
Local labour disputes in the first seven months of 2009 jumped 14% year on year in the wake of the economic crisis, which has seen increased government support for enterprises alongside increased calls for wage cuts, benefit cuts and lower pay by employers.
In 2009, several large scale strikes ended in success and new union formation.
No recognition of collective bargaining rights: Collective bargaining is neither promoted nor encouraged by the authorities, and employers generally refuse to recognise unions.
Although almost 25 % of the workforce is unionised, unions are not strong enough to force management to engage in collective bargaining.
Thus, less than 1% of workers are covered by collective agreements, and those that do exist are not legally binding.
Without legal protection to guarantee these rights, workers are subject to the arbitrary and unilateral actions of employers and as a consequence are denied job and income security.
The Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions (HKCTU) is consistently excluded from the LAB, the tripartite consultative body established by the government, unlike pro-government union federations.
This exclusion means it is denied the right to participate in tripartite negotiations on labour laws and policy and excluded from bodies such as the Committee on the Implementation of International Standards, which reports to the ILO.
Employers often attempt to take advantage of the disparity and political divisions among staff unions including the divide between the pro-democratic Confederation of trade unions HKCTU and the pro-Beijing Federation of trade unions.
Hong Kong is one of the few developed economies without legislation on maximum working hours or minimum wages.
After a long campaign by the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions the government has finally agreed to draft a minimum wage bill but is still seeking to exclude foreign domestic workers.
Consultation rather than bargaining in the public sector: The government has consistently claimed that there is no need for collective bargaining rights in the public sector because the administration "consults" civil servants over their pay and conditions.
However, recent civil service reforms, involving transfers, reductions in wages and benefits, retrenchment and contracting-out to the private sector, have demonstrated very clearly that the government is free to act unilaterally without consulting the affected civil servants.
The introduction of legislation on wage cuts for civil servants is an example.
Lengthy delays in labour tribunals – employers ignore unions: In February, tour guides went on strike over bonuses and wages.
They had originally put a case to the Labour Tribunal in 2004, but the dispute has still not been resolved.
The court recently turned down an appeal by the employers, but it is believed that they will appeal again and the case could continue for a further five years.
The tour guides regard the labour tribunal proceedings as a way for companies simply to delay matters, rather than a means of resolving industrial disputes.
As a result of this, they have decided not to go ahead with further cases.
The unions had instead asked the company to negotiate directly with them, but it had refused to do so.
Self-employment refers to the status of an individual who—rather than accepting a position as an employee of another person or organization—chooses to go into business for him or herself.
Self-employment offers individuals a number of advantages, from the freedom to work without supervision to the ability to deduct the costs of doing business for tax purposes.
But it also has some potential drawbacks, including uncertain levels of income, long working hours, isolation, and the need to fund one's own health insurance and retirement plans.
People choose self-employment for a wide variety of reasons.
Some desire a change in lifestyle, some are unable to find other employment, some want to work at home in order to care for small children, and some are retirees seeking additional income.
Regardless of the under-lying motivation, however, there are ways for self-employed persons to overcome the potential drawbacks and increase their chances for success.
An individual's status as a self-employed, independent contractor can be reinforced by having multiple clients, being paid by the amount of work done rather than by the hour, or obtaining an employer identification number from the IRS.
Working under a business name also helps reinforce this status.
Printing invoices, business cards, and stationery can also help identify someone as a self-employed person.
In general, the person must demonstrate that he or she is in business for the purpose of making a profit.
By 1993, one-fifth of all new jobs in the United States were created by self-employment, and self-employed persons accounted for 7.6 percent of the work force.
In fact, job growth in this category increased almost twice as fast as overall job growth.
The highest growth came in the finance, insurance, property, and business services industries—areas where professionals could expect to earn more by becoming independent.
In the late 1990s, the number of self-employed Americans actually declined slightly as a percentage of the U.S. work force, and according to some studies, only 2 percent of people who go the entrepreneurial route stay self-employed 10 years later.
But despite such sobering statistics, starting one's own business remains a dream that continues to be pursued by millions of individuals every year.
It is difficult to exaggerate the importance of referrals to the typical independent professional.
Since relationships are so vital, one must exercise the utmost delicacy in terminating employment with one's former employer or turning down a job.
One's former employer can even become a good client, besides providing valuable referrals.
When turning down clients, the self-employed person can protect those relationships by making referrals or even subcontracting to other colleagues in their network.
Provided the work done is of quality, this can strengthen one's reputation as a purveyor of talent—whether one's own or an associate's.
When the client calls back with a more appropriate assignment, the contractor has the choice of the business.
The main tax disadvantage for self-employed persons is that they must pay the full amount of Social Security and Medicare taxes themselves and make quarterly estimated tax payments to the federal government.
For those who are organizationally employed, the employer withholds income taxes and pays half of their Social Security and Medicare taxes.
Although the payment of Social Security and Medicare increases the tax burden of self-employed individuals, these amounts are based on net, rather than gross, earnings.
For this reason, it is essential for small business owners to keep an accurate record of expenses.
Self-employed individuals also file quarterly taxes.
Self-employment, whether by choice or necessity, does not include any guarantee of success.
In fact, nearly two out of every three new businesses fail within five years.
But the chances of success can be greatly improved with careful planning, prior savings, and a sound marketing strategy.
It may also be helpful to make the transition to full-time self-employment gradually.
One option is to " moonlight ," or work part-time as a free-lancer while maintaining at least part-time employment on the side.
Although some employers frown on this arrangement, it can provide an individual with time and money to develop a client base and a business plan.
Those planning home-based businesses should also take time to prepare family members for the changes that will take place.
Although one stable client relationship can help establish a new business, it is also important that the self-employed person develop a marketing strategy to find new clients and grow.
Many new business owners become so busy serving their existing clients that they do not devote sufficient time to marketing.
Sending out brochures, networking, and joining professional organizations are a few possible marketing strategies.
Finally, self-employed individuals should take an organized approach to all business activities in order to increase their chances of success.
It may be helpful to draw up a business plan to follow when starting and growing a new business.
This plan can help a self-employed person evaluate strategies, plan expenditures, and motivate him or herself.
It is also important to keep careful records of income and expenses, set aside money for taxes, and insist upon contracts for all work performed.
To be self-employed is not the same as being a business owner : A business owner is not required to be hands-on with the day-to-day operations of his or her company, while a self-employed person has to utilize a very hands-on approach in order to survive.
According the US Beureau of Labor Statistics, only 44% of businesses survive the first 4 years in business.
Self-employed persons report their business income or loss on Schedule C of IRS Form 1040 and calculate the self-employment tax on Schedule SE of IRS Form 1040.
Estimated taxes must be paid quarterly using form 1040-ES if estimated tax liability exceeds $1,000.
A self-employed person in the United Kingdom can operate as a sole trader or as an incorporated limited liability company.
It is also possible for someone to form a business that is run only part-time or concurrently while holding down a full time job.
This form of employment, while popular, does come with several legal responsibilities.
When working from home clearance may sometimes be required from the local authority to use part of the home as business premises.
Should the business hold records of customers or suppliers in any electronic form it is required to register with the Information Commissioner's Office .
Other legal responsibilities include statutory public liability insurance cover, modifying premises to be disabled friendly, and the proper recording and accounting of financial transactions.
Free advice on the range of responsibilities is available from government operated Business Link centres.
A self-employed person may be subject to more taxes than an average employee.
In addition to both the employee and employer National Insurance contributions, there may be VAT , business rates and other taxes payable to central and local governments.
2008 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Algeria
Union activists are often harassed, subjected to legal action or dismissed.
Legal obstacles and a negative attitude among employers make it difficult to set up unions.
Two foreign companies sacked activists who were attempting to organise the workforce.
In the public sector, the authorities have continued to oppose the emergence of an independent trade union movement.
Limited freedom of association: Workers who have held Algerian nationality for at least ten years have the right to form trade unions.
Prior authorisation must be obtained from the government however before a union can operate legally.
The law bans unions from associating with political parties and receiving foreign funding.
To be registered, unions must send the authorities a declaration announcing their establishment and must obtain official recognition within 30 days.
Right to strike restricted: The right to strike is enshrined in the Constitution.
The law requires a secret ballot of the entire workforce to be held in order to call a strike.
A minimum warning of one week is also required.
A minimum service to maintain production must be ensured, together with the continuation of activities essential for preserving the safety of people and goods.
Trade union rights in practice and Violations in 2007
SNAPAP leader suspended and harassed: On 6 June, Sadou Sadek, National Secretary for Trade Union Relations and Rights of the independent union for civil servants, the Syndicat National autonome des Personnels de l'Administration Algérienne (SNAPAP), was suspended from his job at the General Inspectorate, officially because of professional negligence, but in fact because of his trade union activities.
For several weeks he was denied access to the trade union office of his workplace in Bejala.
He was also subjected to legal proceedings for his involvement in a strike organised by his union.
A solidarity action in support of Sadou Sadek was banned by the authorities but nevertheless went ahead.
At year's end, however, Sadou Sadek had not yet been reinstated.
Independent union harassed in education sector: Upon his return from a regional conference of Education International in Cairo, where he had presented a resolution condemning the violation of trade union rights in his country, Abderrazek Salmi, a leader of the independent union of education workers Syndicat Autonome des Travailleurs de l'Education et de la Formation (SATEF), was suspended from his job as a teacher.
He was subsequently reinstated through the intervention and mediation of the General Secretary of the Union Nationale des Personnels de l'Education et de la Formation (UNPEF, National Union of Education Workers).
Compass subsidiary refuses to recognise union.
General secretary dismissed and harassed: In July, Yassine Zaid, General Secretary of the local branch of UGTA at Eurest Support Services (ESS), a subsidiary of the Compass Group, was sacked, allegedly for insulting an executive of the company, which acts as a contractor providing meals and accommodation for workers at the Hassi Messaoud oil fields.
ESS pressed charges and on 2 December Yassine Zaid was sentenced to a fine of 10,000 dinars (€100) on the basis of false evidence, according to the trade unionist.
In December, ESS filed another complaint against him for "libel on the Internet".
Yassine Zaid had in fact created a blog in which he described the poor living conditions, including bad food and inadequate sanitary facilities, endured by ESS workers.
Yassine Zaid's victimisation began towards the end of 2006, when together with some work colleagues he decided to set up a union.
The company's management, which since then has refused all contact with the workers' representatives, insulted two labour inspectors who had been called in by UGTA to apply for recognition of the union.
On 30 November, ESS Chief Executive Officer Bill Joel tore up the union's founding document in front of a group of employees.
Trade union leader dismissed from public enterprise: At the beginning of July, in Annaba, industrial pipe manufacturer Alfapipe sacked a union official who had criticised the management of this public company for its poor performance, including the loss of a major maintenance contract.
Most of the 570 workers of the Annaba production unit went on strike in protest at the dismissal.
The dispute lasted several weeks.
Two other union leaders were arrested.
Weak trade union presence in the private sector and the informal economy: These two sectors, both of which have been expanding considerably, are associated with increasingly poor working conditions, non-compliance with labour legislation, lack of social protection and lack of freedom of association.
In practice, many private companies consider themselves exempt from compliance with labour regulations and are focused on maximising short-term profits.
Employers often do not register most of their workers, thus depriving them of all legally established rights.
Workers have no minimum wage, no social security benefits and no pensions.
In the textile industry, where women account for a large proportion of the workforce, this precariousness makes it very difficult to organise the workers since they are afraid of losing their jobs if they join a union.
In British Columbia over the past almost 10 years, the Campbell coalition has created a province in which it is shamefully possible to work full time and still not be able to house and feed yourself adequately, where the government has given up on any serious attempts to regulate child labor and worker safety, where child poverty is higher than anywhere else in Canada, where foreign workers are brought in by the thousands to flip burgers and harvest crops but denied a right to settle and make a life in Canada, and where it is harder and harder for workers to organize for better conditions via trade unions.
In the USA—its non-military economy destroyed by the corporate globalizers and its struggling taxpayers made to fund military compensation rates more than triple the private sector rate—military recruitment is thriving and military communities are now among the wealthiest in the country.
Will we see the same reshaping of society begin to happen in tag-along little neighbor, Canada?
... So, what conclusions can we draw from these stories and from the reflections of many seasoned labour relations observers?
Here are a few.
The decade has seen the Campbell Liberals radically re-structure the legal and administrative bodies that govern labour relations in B.C., mainly in ways that tilt the regulatory playing field to give employers the home-team advantage on wage rates, employment standards, compensation for injured workers and the creation of new unions and union contracts.
"We are losing union density and that will continue," commented CUPE B.C.
President Barry O'Neill.
"Limits on union growth have been created by changes in the Labour Relations Code.
"
Lucy Luna, who organizes farmworkers in the Fraser Valley for the Agricultural Workers Alliance, says that one ruling by the newly employer friendly Labour Relations Board in 2008, which made temporary workers fear that employers can now get away with punishing them for joining a union by sending them home as soon as they unionize "has made my work almost impossible.
"
Meanwhile, the face of the labour movement is changing, with more and more of its membership concentrated in public-sector bodies, many with predominantly female and visible minority memberships.
In another significant change, the IWA, the logger and mill workers' union that was for many years an iconic presence in B.C.
labour relations, was absorbed by the United Steel Workers this decade, and union density continued to fall.
...
The prospects for Lyn and others like her have been shaped not only by a rough economy but by policies enacted by the B.C.
Liberal government since 2001.
Complex changes to the Employment Standards Act have ushered in overtime averaging rules that cause employers to pressure workers into pulling long shifts over consecutive days.
Call-in periods for employees have been reduced [to] two [from] four hours, giving people less time to rearrange their lives for the sake of a shift.
Posting employment standards and work schedules in the workplace was deemed unnecessary.
Enforcement of the act switched from routine government inspection to a complaint-based system devoid of requirement to investigate complaints.
Fifty per cent of standards offices were closed.
... B.C.
Liberal policy changes also increased both the supply of casual workers and the abundance of casual jobs, making it necessary for people to take nearly any available job, no matter how low paying or volatile.
Access to social assistance was complicated and restricted, along with a 30 per cent cut to the budget of the ministry of housing and social development, according to the CCPA's 2008 report on casual work.
Additional changes to eligibility for single parents with children, waiting periods for social assistance and cuts to benefits furthered the likelihood of job seekers to take on non-standard, precarious work.
The privatization of crown corporations like B.C.
Rail, part of B.C.
Hydro and B.C.
Ferries made well-paying jobs in the public service prone to cost reduction measures and cuts.
Meanwhile, the passing of bill C-29 in 2002 privatized and contracted out 9,000 jobs in B.C.
health support services.
This transformed accessible, dependable full time jobs, worked largely by immigrant workers, into low-wage part-time positions, which many employees now have to work two or three of to get by.
...
Specifically, why doesn’t it apply to Ontario’s public sector workers, who certainly did nothing to provoke the financial crisis, but who are being singled out to play a particularly large role in deficit reduction.
Under Ontario’s two-year public sector pay freeze, for instance, a nursing home worker earning $25,000 a year would give up a hefty $1,000 annually, says Erin Weir, an economist with the United Steelworkers union.
Ontario argues that its huge deficit leaves it no choice but to cut public sector pay.
But that doesn’t explain why, at the same time, it is cutting corporate taxes, making the deficit even bigger.
...
But rather than being asked now to contribute to deficit reduction — along with public sector workers — the financial sector stands to be the single largest beneficiary of the province’s corporate tax cuts, saving roughly $500 million in taxes this year.
In fact, the public sector pay cuts, which might save the province an estimated $1.7 billion annually, won’t really reduce the deficit at all.
They’ll help pay for the corporate tax cuts.
In other words, that $1,000 taken away from the struggling nursing home worker earning $25,000 a year isn’t really going toward deficit reduction.
It’s going into reducing the taxes of some of our richest banks and corporations.
No doubt, there are highly paid economists out there who can explain why this policy is sensible.
2009 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - France
More laws curbing the right to strike and collective bargaining autonomy have been introduced.
Anti-union discrimination takes place, but can be fought effectively in the courts.
Freedom of association, collective bargaining and the right to strike are fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution.
Workers are free to form and joint trade unions, with the only exception being military personnel as well as prefects and sub-prefects, due to their status as representatives of the State.
Migrant workers have the right to be elected to trade union posts if they are at least 18 years old.
Trade unions need to be registered, which only means depositing the union constitutions and list of leaders with the city council.
In theory, public prosecutors can verify compliance of a trade union constitution with the law, but this is a mere formality.
As regards access to workplaces, the employer's agreement is needed if external trade union representatives wish to visit a trade union organisation within the enterprise.
Once a month, trade unions can call a meeting of all members or all employees on the enterprise territory, which has to take place outside working hours.
According to case-law, distribution of trade union leaflets is allowed if it does not interfere with the normal functioning of the enterprise.
In the case of bodies financed primarily from public funds (such as social security agencies), the approval of the supervisory authority is needed for a collective agreement to come into force.
In 2004 the Labour Code was amended to introduce "derogation clauses" at the enterprise level, which significantly altered the relative importance of the bargaining levels.
While enterprise-level agreements cannot be less favourable for workers than higher-level agreements in terms of minimum salaries, social security and some other provisions, a lot of other pay-related issues (such as 13th salary) are not exempt from that possibility.
The broadened scope of enterprise-level agreements in this law also led to more derogation clauses.
An employer can now push for an enterprise-level agreement that would take away workers' rights based on the relevant sectoral-level agreement.
While the government proclaimed that derogation clauses were "an essential landmark in the history of collective bargaining", the ITUC-affiliated CGT Force Ouvrière trade union views it as a regressive measure.
The law of 20 August on renewing social democracy and working time reform introduced further flexibility at the expense of existing workers' rights.
The working time regulations are no longer regarded as compulsory standards, but rather as "rules by default" applicable only where no collective agreement has been concluded.
Companies are allowed to re-negotiate the 35-hour working week, the amount of overtime, rest periods and similar issues.
The "majority agreement" (approved by trade unions that obtained a majority of workplace election votes) overrides higher-level collective agreements, even where the latter are more favourable for the employees.
Right to strike: As a constitutional right, strikes are subject to very little legal regulation.
Certain rules have been developed through jurisprudence, such as the prohibition of go-slows, sit-ins and work-to-rule strikes.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2008
Subtle pressure: Obstacles to trade union activities do exist.
Employers use subtle tactics such as dividing enterprises into smaller units or outsourcing to dilute trade union density and to inhibit the contacts between trade union delegates and workers.
Access to work for external trade union representatives can be a problem.
Various manoeuvres are used to avoid genuine collective bargaining, including negotiations with non-representative trade unions.
Interference: According to the ITUC-affiliated Democratic Confederation of Labour (CFDT), there are cases of employers' intervention in trade union elections.
Another ITUC affiliate, the General Workers' Confederation (CGT), reports that anti-union propaganda is a problem, especially in large enterprises.
Discrimination: The CGT reports that trade union leaders and activists are very frequently discriminated against, but unions bring the cases before courts.
Trade union activists may face discrimination, with disciplinary sanctions applied or their careers being suspended.
Pressure intensifies during collective disputes.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Latvia
The right to bargain collectively is not guaranteed in practice, and multinationals tend to avoid bargaining altogether.
The thresholds for forming trade unions are too high, and the right to strike is restricted.
Certain limitations apply despite basic trade union rights being guaranteed in the Constitution.
Every union must have at least 50 members, or not less than one quarter of the workers employed in the unit, profession or sector.
Collective bargaining is recognised except for special service ranks in the Ministry of the Interior and Prison Administration, however there is little scope to bargain on employment conditions in the public administration.
The right to strike is restricted as the decision to initiate strike action must be taken by a three-quarters' majority at a quorum where Â¾ of the employees or members are present.
Furthermore, solidarity strikes are illegal unless the dispute concerns a sectoral level collective agreement, and political strikes are prohibited.
Some categories of workers are unduly excluded from the right to strike, and the list of "essential services", in which a minimum service must be established, is somewhat too elaborate.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Background: The social turmoil triggered by the financial crisis led to the fall of the government in February.
Anti-crisis measures involving wage and staff cuts in the public service were adopted without a proper dialogue with trade unions, and a number of street protests took place during the year.
Unemployment had soared to 22.3% by the end of the year – the highest jobless rate in the EU.
Collective bargaining hampered: The new law "On the Remuneration of State and Local Government Institutions Officials and Employees" has created problems for collective bargaining agents in the public sector, since it outlaws all monetary benefits under collective agreements unless they are directly provided by law.
Some public employers also refuse to bargain collectively, for example the bus company "Ogres autobuss".
Multinationals shun collective agreements: According to estimations by the Latvian Trade Union Confederation (LBAS), there are fewer collective bargaining agreements in multinationals than in other companies in the private sector.
Foreign companies in general and multinationals in particular are reluctant to apply collective agreements to their Latvian branches.
Commerce, banking and personal services are the most difficult sectors.
On the other hand, LBAS reports that if a multinational does conclude an agreement, compliance is better than in other companies.
New violations at Latvenergo: Latvenergo and the related companies Sadales tikls and Augstsprieguma tikls that were mentioned in the 2009 edition of the Survey for attempting to abolish the check-off system, used the law "On the Remuneration of State and Local Government Institutions Officials and Employees" as an excuse for refusing to implement some provisions of the collective agreement.
As a result, workers' salaries decreased by approximately 15%.
The conflict was later settled through negotiation.

2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Lithuania
Anti-union behaviour remains a problem, and women are especially affected: two big companies noted for their anti-union behaviour have a predominantly female workforce.
At least three trade unionists were fired in connection with their activism.
The authorities unsuccessfully attempted to charge organisers of a union rally with misdemeanour.
The right to strike is subject to many restrictions.
Despite recent amendments to the Labour Code, a number of restrictions to trade union rights still apply.
The law recognises the right to form and join trade unions, but at least 30 members or one-fifth of the total workforce is required to create a union, and workers who are dismissed cannot keep their trade union membership.
The right to collective bargaining is secured in both the private and the public sector, except for certain government employees.
The right to strike is circumscribed by several provisions, and is not extended to some civil servants.
Strikes are only possible if all dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted, and are only permitted at the company level.
Solidarity strikes are also prohibited.
Furthermore, employers have the right to employ other persons to perform the work of striking workers in certain sectors, including public transport and waste disposal.
The authorities can decide on the minimum service to be established during a strike if the parties fail to reach an agreement.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Ineffective legal protection: The judicial system is slow in dealing with unfair dismissal cases.
There are no labour courts or judges specialised in labour disputes.
Furthermore, the trade union organiser has to prove that s/he was dismissed due to trade union activities, which is impossible in most cases.
Charges against organisers of a protest action: The national protest action of 16 January, organised by three national trade union centres – the Lithuanian Trade Union Confederation (LPSK), the Lithuanian Labour Federation (LDF) and the Lithuanian Trade Union 'Solidarity' (LPS 'Solidarumas') – called for responsible anti-crisis measures and social dialogue.
The protest, which involved some 5,000 to 7,000 people, ended in riots and civil unrest.
The trade unions, which had called on the participants to stay calm and respect the rights and freedoms of others, dissociated themselves from the rioters.
Nevertheless, three leaders of the national confederations, Arturas Cerniauskas of LPSK, Vydas Puskepalis of LDF and Aldona Jasinskiene of LPS 'Solidarumas', were charged with misdemeanour for failing to ensure sufficient control of the meeting.
Brewery undermines collective bargaining: In 2008, the Svyturys – Utenos Alus company had signed a collective agreement covering two Carlsberg-controlled breweries (see the 2009 edition of the Survey).
On 16 March, the company asked the trade union to renegotiate the wage indexation provided by the collective agreement.
The union then asked for information pertaining to the company's financial situation.
Management responded by calling a staff assembly on 25 March to select a "staff representative", and then told the union that either it should sign amendments to the collective agreement without any further discussion, or else the agreement would be signed by the staff representative.
The union managed to oppose this manoeuvre, however, and negotiations resumed shortly afterwards.
Union busting in supermarkets: In 2008, a trade union affiliated to the Lithuanian Labour Federation was established at Palink, which owns a number of supermarket chains including IKI, IKIUKAS and CENTO.
Since then, trade union members and leaders at the company, most of them women, have been harassed and intimidated.
The three most active members of the union board have lost their jobs.
Galina Proskurina was sacked and escorted out by company security guards just one day after the union was established.
Oksana Michalevic received an official warning, was threatened with more disciplinary sanctions and was eventually forced to resign due to health problems that were probably caused by work-related stress.
Irina Judina, who faced constant harassment at the workplace after being elected to the trade union board, was fired for gross professional misconduct.
These cases were pending in court at the end of the year.
Unauthorised surveillance: In September Roma Katinene, a criminal investigator and a leader of the Kaunas branch of the pre-trial investigators' trade union, discovered that an audio surveillance device had been placed in her office.
It had not been placed by the internal control services, and an inquiry concluded that no surveillance had been authorised and that it was illegal.
Several trade union leaders publicly commented that the surveillance was an attempt to monitor trade union activities, as the Kaunas branch has been the most active organisation in the region.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Montenegro
Union activities are primarily hampered by restrictive provisions on the right to strike, and workers who organised strikes suffered intimidation by their employers.
Although the Labour Code provides for basic trade union rights, it contains excessive restrictions.
The 2007 Constitution and 2008 Labour Law recognise the right to form and join trade unions, and the Law on Civil Servants and State Employees grants that right to said categories of workers.
Collective bargaining is hampered by the fact that only the most representative unions, that is unions with the largest membership, can be parties to collective agreements.
Furthermore, the law stipulates that the right to strike may be limited for persons employed in state bodies and public service on grounds of protecting the public interest.
A minimum service must also be established in a number of services following consultations with the relevant trade union.
Albeit the 2005 Law on Strikes improved the situation, the employer can still decide on the minimum service unilaterally if negotiations with the union fail.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Anti-union discrimination: Dismissals, demotions and transfers of trade union activists are not uncommon.
The 2008 Labour Law did not help the situation by introducing flexible rules on fixed-term contracts.
Workers are also increasingly offered the possibility of converting their open-ended contracts into temporary jobs.
The resulting job insecurity is hampering organising.
Employers threatened to sue strikers: The Confederation of Trade Unions of Montenegro (SSCG) reports that the right to strike is often not respected.
When the trade union at Mikro, in Bijelo Polje, organised a strike to protest against unpaid salaries and allowances – in full compliance with the national procedures – the employer threatened to sue the union for EUR 100,000 in damages.
A similar situation led to a strike by the local branch of the construction workers' union at Prvoborac – Kamen i Beton, in Herzig Novi.
Following the strike, the management gave the local trade union leader an official warning.
2009 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Portugal
The law protects trade union rights, but in practice collective bargaining and trade union meetings are often hampered.
In March, striking teachers were harassed by the police.
Freedom of association: The Constitution and the 2003 Labour Code recognise freedom of association.
All workers, with the exception of members of the armed forces and some police forces, are allowed to form and join trade unions.
The government has stated the need to encourage trade union participation amongst migrant workers.
In June, the social partners signed a tripartite agreement providing for a new system for industrial relations, employment policy and social protection.
This agreement will influence the draft new Labour Code, prepared in line with the "flexicurity" concept (combining labour flexibility with job security).
Collective bargaining: Trade unions have the right to bargain collectively.
While the 2003 Labour Code did not introduce any rules that would violate ILO standards, a few provisions did affect the balance of collective bargaining.
Namely, according to the Code, collective agreements can supersede legislation, both when the agreement is more favourable for workers and when it is less favourable.
Trade unions hope that this article will be revised during the upcoming Labour Code reform.
The Code also stipulates that if a collective agreement is not renewed, it can cease to have legal effect.
Public service collective bargaining is defined as "appraisal and discussion" between trade unions and public administration with the view to arriving at consensus.
These negotiations do not result in legally binding collective agreements.
The Public Service Collective Bargaining Act restricts the scope of bargaining to pay and pay-related issues such as various welfare benefits.
The law explicitly excludes from collective bargaining issues relating to the structure, assigned tasks and competence of the public administration.
Strikes and arbitration: The right to strike is guaranteed, and procedures for calling a strike are reasonable.
Once a trade union has given notice of a strike, the employer is not allowed to hire additional labour to replace strikers.
Contracting outside companies to do the work of striking workers is also prohibited.
Wildcat strikes are prohibited and can result in workers' facing liability for damages.
Compulsory arbitration is viewed as a mechanism of exceptional nature to be applied under strict conditions.
The number of workers affected, the relevance of the dispute in terms of workers' protection, and the potential social and economic impacts of the conflict are taken into consideration.
Arbitration can also be imposed for determining minimum services.
Trade union meetings: Trade unions have the right to access the work place.
A 48-hours notice is required to organise a trade union meeting on the company premises and a six-hour notice should be given if a trade union representative not working in the company is going to be present.
Trade union meetings during working hours are limited to 15 hours per year, but for workers these hours are considered as working time.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2008
When an employer is considering whether to terminate the employment of someone suffering from an illness or disorder said to be connected with work-related stress, potential areas of liability arise under both statute and common law.
The potential for liability arises, in a statutory context, in respect of: workers' compensation; occupational health and safety; disability discrimination; and under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth).
It follows that employers should establish and maintain systems for ensuring that the risk of hazards in the workplace that could give rise to psychiatric or psychological disorders is controlled, and regularly review those systems and policies.
Psychological injuries should be reported to the relevant WorkCover authority and any complaints or reports or instances of psychological injury should be investigated.
Directors and senior managers need to be aware that their OH&S obligations also extend to risks of psychological or psychiatric injury as potential consequences of stress.
Fulfilling these OH&S duties will also help ensure that, when considering termination of employment of an employee which is associated with an ongoing stress-related condition, an employer has complied with its anti-discrimination obligations, thus reducing the chances of unlawful or unfair dismissal claims.
Therefore, if an employer sought to terminate the employment of a worker suffering from an illness or disorder arising from work-related stress, it may face a claim for discrimination under the DDA on the basis that the termination was unlawfully discriminatory if it was based on a disability constituted by the stress-related condition.
In an unfair dismissal case, Dundovich v P&O Ports (5), a Full Bench of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission dealt with a situation in which new working arrangements had caused an employee to develop anxiety and depression.
The employee's physical and mental health deteriorated and he began taking prescribed medication which, in turn, affected his ability to operate the machinery his new role demanded of him.
This case, among others, illustrates the need for employers to consider not only their obligations under the unfair dismissal and unlawful termination provisions of the Workplace Relations Act but also the interaction of those obligations with the provisions of the accident compensation legislation.
This can be a far from easy task, given the sometimes time-consuming processes which may be involved to determine liability.
Just as systems of work and the condition of equipment may affect an employee's physical health and risk of physical injury, other aspects of the conduct of the employment relationship have the potential to be stressful which in turn, in some situations, may give rise to a recognised illness or disorder being suffered by the employee.
Just as systems of work and the condition of equipment may affect an employee's physical health ... other aspects of the conduct of the employment relationship have the potential to ... give rise to a recognised illness or disorder ...
But that doesn’t mean that the only payment that you are responsible for providing to employees is a salary or hourly wage.
In fact, every business owner who hires employees is required to provide three mandated benefits:
Unemployment insurance is a combined Federal and State program that was started during the Great Depression, and whose legislative origins are found in the Social Security Act of 1935.
New employers in Pennsylvania must register with the Department of Labor & Industry within 30 days of the date in which covered employment is first provided.
In other words, registration should coincide with the hiring and start date of your employee.
Like Social Security and Medicare, unemployment insurance is jointly paid for by both the employer and employee.
Although, the employer pays a significantly higher percentage tax, there is a wage base limit that is not used in calculating the employee’s contribution.
Employee contribution to unemployment insurance is 0.09% in 2006 AND is based on the individual’s total (gross) wages – there is NO wage base limit in effect for the employee’s contribution.
These rates will apply to the employer for the first two or three calendar years in which wages are paid to employees.
A computed or standard rate may be triggered if the company is deemed to have sufficient experience.
For more information on Pennsylvania unemployment insurance, visit www.dli.state.pa.us.
Workers’ compensation provides medical treatment, vocational rehabilitation, wage-loss indemnification and death/burial benefits to victims (or their surviving dependents) of industrial accidents and occupational disease.
In the vast majority of states, employers are solely liable for payment of the workers’ compensation premiums.
Workers compensation must be paid even if you have only one employee AND that employee is a family member.
While percentage rates are readily available for Social Security, Medicare and unemployment insurance, the employer’s annual workers’ compensation premium is based on a complex system of classifications and experience ratings that vary by state.
Therefore, you need to also consider a variety of voluntary benefits that can enhance your recruitment and retention efforts.
Because these are optional benefits, you have greater discretion in deciding what to offer.
Chambers of commerce and other professional organizations often offer reduced group rates for health, vision, dental and life insurance to their members.
Flexible work schedules generally cost little and can greatly contribute to employee retention.
Respecting and recognizing employee contributions, although ‘free,’ are often a deciding factor in whether a job candidate will accept your offer of employment – and whether he or she will stay with your organization.
Just be sure to align your benefits strategy with your overall corporate strategy.

2007 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Spain
As part of a new social dialogue drive over 20 agreements were signed between the government, the employers and trade unions.
A highlight was the tripartite agreement on labour market reforms which aims to promote job stability and to reduce the high proportion of temporary contracts, which have undermined trade union rights.
The Civil Guard protested about their freedom of association.
A union representative was sacked by a hotel chain for speaking out about poor health and safety practices, while the suppliers of one multinational replaced some striking workers.
Volkswagen threatened to relocate if strike action continued.
The Constitution guarantees the right to collective bargaining and protects the binding power of collective agreements.
The law also protects the right to strike.
Temporary contracts affect collective bargaining: Although Spain has a well established system of collective bargaining it is undermined in practice by the high number of temporary contracts.
Various statistics confirm that Spain is the European Union country with the highest percentage of workers on temporary contracts (32.5 per cent in 2004), 63 per cent of whom are immigrants.
This clearly influences the working conditions of these workers.
Taking advantage of these workers' uncertainty about their future employment, employers have made them accept working conditions that are not in line with legal standards.
Whilst in theory temporary workers' contracts are covered by a sectoral agreement fixing their terms of employment, in practice collective bargaining is being replaced by individual agreements between managers and employees, who are obliged in practice to accept what they are offered.
Multinationals: Some big multinationals use their position to undermine trade union rights, such as threatening to relocate if they are affected by trade union action.
Striking workers dismissed: In January 2006 the strike committee representing transport workers in the Vizcaya region, UGT-Transportes de Vizcaya, filed a complaint to the Labour Inspectorate about the companies LIAN S.L.
and PERSONAL DRIVER S.L., which are furniture suppliers for the multinational IKEA, for sacking employees who were on strike and replacing them with new recruits, since this is an illegal practice that violates the right to strike.
Volkswagen threatens strikers with redundancy: The Volkswagen car company threatened on 30 March to move production of the new Polo out of Spain if the long-running strike at its Pamplona factory continued.
The strike was over the failure to finalise negotiations on a new collective agreement after 15 months.
The principal bones of contention were the proposed cost cutting and flexibility measures proposed by management.
The company originally threatened to move production to Bratislava in Slovakia, as it had done previously with its SEAT Ibiza model, although this plan was later rejected.
At the end of the year there was still a risk that production could be moved elsewhere.
Union representative sacked for denouncing unsafe working conditions: On 11 December union representative Antonio Garcia Ramos of the hotel workers' union Federación Estatal de Comercio, Hostelería y Turismo de CC.OO.
(FECOHT-CC.OO) for Iberostar hotels in the Canary Islands, was unfairly dismissed from his job with the Spanish hotel and tourism conglomerate Iberostar.
Management objected to his public statements denouncing unsafe working conditions for hotel staff and the company's refusal to implement recommendations issued by the health and safety authorities.
Iberostar operates hotels in 13 countries.
2008 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Azerbaijan
Freedom of association and collective bargaining: The Constitution provides for freedom of association, including the right to form trade unions.
In 2004, the government ratified the European Social Charter, notably the articles on freedom of association and collective bargaining.
Under the 1994 Act on Trade Unions, seven persons or more may form a trade union and adopt its rules.
Persons performing their military service, and managerial staff, are, however, excluded.
The Act also provides for the right of trade unions to conclude collective agreements and prohibits discrimination against trade unions.
A 1996 law provides for collective bargaining agreements to set wages in state enterprises.
In 2006 the Labour Code and the Act on Trade Unions were amended.
According to the new changes employers cannot dismiss employees without the written consent of the trade union within the enterprise.
By-passing the unions in multinational enterprises: According to national legislation, all labour laws cover all workers and enterprises operating in Azerbaijan.
However, the government can legally conclude with multinational enterprises (MNEs) bilateral agreements that set aside labour laws.
The Parliament must ratify these agreements.
They are not officially published, and neither unions nor even labour inspectorates have access to them.
This anomaly is leading to the violation of labour rights in such enterprises.
However, the government has acknowledged the problem in its report to the ILO.
Public transport strikes still banned: The Constitution provides for the right to strike, but there are exceptions.
In addition to banning strikes in the services deemed essential by international standards, the 1999 Labour Code states that employees of legislative authorities, relevant executive authorities, courts and law enforcement authorities may not go on strike.
Strikes are also prohibited in the railway and air transport sectors.
Article 188-3 of the Penal Code bans collective action aimed at disrupting public transport, and failure to respect the ban carries a penalty of up to three years' imprisonment.
In 2001, the government said it was revising its legislation and promised it would take ILO comments into account, but no new regulation has yet been adopted.
Trade union rights in practice and Violations in 2007
Background: The informal economy has been flourishing.
According to different estimates up to half of the Azeri workforce may be working informally, without social security coverage and often without basic rights.
Trade unions are trying to organise informal workers in spite of a number of technical and practical obstacles.
Directors of many foreign companies working in the oil sector (there are over 50) also prevented their workers from forming trade unions.
A secret ballot taken in British Petroleum showed that the majority of workers wanted a trade union to be formed, but, since the employer openly opposes it, workers are still not unionised.
Collective bargaining not respected: Most industries are still state-owned and are run by government-appointed boards of directors who set wages.
Despite the law, an effective system of collective bargaining between unions and enterprise management has yet to be established.
Unions rarely participate in determining wage levels.
Where collective agreements exist, they are not always respected.
The Azerbaijan Trade Union Confederation (ATUC) reported that although the law allows for workers in foreign companies to establish trade unions, and for non-Azerbaijani nationals to form trade unions, employers do not always respect the law.
Azeri nationals employed by foreign companies, notably oil companies, often face discrimination.
In many cases they are hired on short term contracts for as little as three months and then dismissed from their positions.
They are forced to work overtime, and do not receive annual holiday pay or compensation for occupational injuries or diseases.
Maternity Benefits: Employers are required to grant new mothers up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave with job security under the Family and Medical Leave Act.
Many employers, however, have their own policies on maternity leave and do offer pay for a portion of this time.
The average cost of a hospital stay for childbirth in the United States is $8,800, according to a study conducted by The March of Dimes .
Maternity Benefits: Women in France take 16 weeks of mandatory, paid maternity leave from work, according to the BBC .
This time allotment increases after the woman has had a second child.
Both men and women have the option to take up to three years off from work (unpaid) after having a child, with total job security if he or she decides to return to work.
The French government also offers citizens a host of parental services, including financial supplements for families with three or more children, single parent allowances, low-cost day care and nanny services.
Maternity Benefits: In England, women on maternity leave are entitled to 26 weeks off at full pay (90 percent from the government and the rest by the employer), according to the BBC.
New fathers can take up to two weeks paid paternity leave.
Other benefits to parents in England include tax breaks, the ability to create flexible work schedules and parental leave with job security.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Greece
Investigations into last year's barbaric attack against Konstantina Kuneva have been slow and inefficient, although an attempt to archive the case was countered.
Leaders of the journalists' trade union were targeted in a series of explosions.
The right to strike is subject to ambiguous restrictions.
Basic trade union rights are guaranteed, although with certain limitations.
The law stipulates that workers have the right to form and join trade unions without prior authorisation.
Police have the right to organise and to hold demonstrations, but not to strike.
The right to strike is also limited for public servants, employees of local government agencies and judicial officials, as well as in enterprises of public nature or of public benefit if deemed vital to serving the basic needs of the society.
Furthermore, the criteria for declaring a strike illegal are vague, as the courts issue their rulings after weighing the opposing interests of workers and employers, assessing the broad implications of the strike and applying the proportionality principle.
All strikes must be called by recognised trade unions, and wildcat strikes are prohibited.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Background: The Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement won the general elections in October, inheriting a deep recession, a ballooning public debt, and industrial unrest that included violent clashes between the police and demonstrators.
In December, the prime minister unveiled a programme of stringent spending cuts and a public sector pay freeze.
Banks oppose sectoral collective bargaining: Banks in Greece have in recent years systematically pursued a strategy of avoiding sectoral-level collective bargaining.
The largest banks and the Hellenic Bank Association EET (which does not consider itself an employers' organisation) have refused to negotiate with the Greek Federation of Bank Employee Unions (OTOE), preferring to bargain at the company level and to implement individualised pay schemes.
When the OTOE applied for mediation, the EET requested the Athens Administrative Court of First Instance to stop the mediation procedure.
The court's preliminary ruling rejected the EET claim.
Konstantina Kuneva update – investigation unsatisfactory: Konstantina Kuneva, the leader of the All Attica Union of Cleaners and Domestic Workers (PEKOP) was brutally attacked in December 2008, presumably in connection with her trade union activities.
Kuneva, who had been intimidated to stop defending cleaners' rights, suffered severe injuries, including loss of sight in one eye and the ability to speak (see the 2009 edition of the Survey).
An official investigation into the case was launched, but it was criticised by human rights organisations for being slow and neglectful.
The police only suspected a crime of passion and disregarded Kuneva's trade union activities.
International Trade Union Confederation, 2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Macedonia, the former Yugoslav Republic of, 9 June 2010, available at: http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/4c4fec6ac.html [accessed 20 September 2010]
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Macedonia, the former Yugoslav Republic of
Labour law was amended in September but remains criticized by some trade union organisations.
Overall, the legal climate is not conducive to unions, as strikes are difficult to organise and union activities can easily be terminated.
Anti-union dismissals remain common practice.
A number of excessive restrictions apply despite basic trade union guarantees.
The Labor Relations Act was amended in September.
However some trade union organisations deplored the lack of social dialogue during the process and considered that some new dispositions have negative impact on trade union rights.
The right to strike is circumscribed, as unions must specify the length of a strike in advance, and the participants can be dismissed and sued for damages if a court declares the strike illegal.
The Labour Relations Law gives employers the right to suspend up to 2% of the participants of a strike throughout its duration if they exhibit violent or "non-democratic" behaviour, a provision that can be widely abused.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Lack of social dialogue in the process of the labour law reform: The Federation of Trade Unions of Macedonia (FTUM) criticized the government for not having included them in the process of the labour law since its adoption in 2005.
Anti-union discrimination: The law prohibits anti-union discrimination.
However, anti-union dismissals exist in practice, and dismissal cases usually take two to three years to resolve in court.
Some companies have allegedly tried to interfere in trade union elections.
2008 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Uruguay
A trade unionist who tried to form a trade union was shot at, and teachers and police officers faced anti-union persecution.
Several companies displayed anti-union behaviour.
A company director at Alamtec threatened trade unionists with a gun, in a repeat of a similar incident in 2006 at the Naussa tannery.
In general, the government respects its citizens' rights.
Freedom of Association: The Constitution recognises freedom of association and recognises the right to strike as a trade union right (art.
57). The law promotes the formation of trade unions and protects trade union leaders and negotiators against discrimination at the workplace.
The law leaves it to the judiciary – through mechanisms for the protection of individual rights – to define when an act is discriminatory and should be revoked.
In the event of dismissal, the dismissed worker should be reinstated in their job, as is the case across the region and the world.
It is the responsibility of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to put in place the tripartite consultative and supervisory mechanisms to oversee the application of this law.
Civil servants, employees of state enterprises and workers in private enterprises may affiliate to trade unions.
Trade union membership is higher in the public sector (over 42 per cent) than in the private sector (approximately 10 per cent.
).
Trade union discrimination: The law expressly prohibits anti-union discrimination.
The law demands that employers rehire workers dismissed for their trade union activities and demands that employers pay compensation to those workers.
The Collective Bargaining Department of the Ministry of Labour investigates claims of anti-union discrimination made by trade unionists.
In general, there are effective mechanisms for resolving workers' complaints against employers.
The right to organise and to collective bargaining: The law allows trade unions to carry out their activities without interference, and the government protects this right and the right to collective bargaining.
The Constitution provides for the right to strike.
Collective bargaining in the private sector: Collective bargaining is mainly carried out by branch of activity, regulating the minimum wage and working conditions for each category of workers in the Wage Councils.
It is a tripartite mechanism, as the State intervenes through the Ministry of Labour, which is one of the negotiating parties on the Wage Councils.
A Law on Collective Bargaining in the Public Sector is currently before Parliament, in line with ILO Conventions 151 and 154, establishing it as inherent to the labour relations system in the public sector.
Export Processing Zones: Labour legislation protects workers in the eight export processing zones.
There are no trade unions in the zones, but the government does not prohibit their formation.
Trade union rights in practice and Violations in 2007
Background: Hundreds of workers took part in a four-hour strike in Montevideo on 23 August to demand "essential changes" to the country's economic policies.
The strike, coordinated by Uruguay's principal national trade union centre (PIT-CNT), included a march on the Ministries of Economy and Finance, and Labour and Social Security.
The leader of the PIT-CNT, Luis Puig, accused the government of President Tabaré Vázquez of compromising its left-wing credentials.
Although the law prohibits trade union discrimination, in practice the trade unions do have to fight against discrimination by the employers.
Violence against women and discrimination against some social groups continue, despite the government's nondiscrimination policies.
Illegal dismissals at the Naussa tannery: On 14 February, the Union of Tanning Workers (UOC) organised a demonstration by some 400 workers in the street outside the Naussa de Las Piedras tannery in Canelones to demand the reinstatement of three dismissed workers and to protest at the dismissal of a trade union leader from the company.
The union's president, Ramón Martínez, stated that the company had violated the agreement signed with the Labour Ministry, promising to give priority to the three dismissed employees before hiring new staff.
Workers occupy savings and loans cooperative COPAC following dismissal of trade union leader: In March about 200 members of the Bank Employees Association of Uruguay (AEBU) marched to the savings and loans cooperative COPAC in Montevideo in protest at the dismissal of a trade union leader and occupied the premises.
Shot fired at worker trying to form a union: On 4 May, Iván Bello of the commerce and industry workers' union Federación de Empleados de Comercio e Industria (FUECI) was shot at on his way to work.
The bullet hit the portable television he was carrying in his back pack, which saved his life.
The trade unionist reported that he had also been shot at the week before and had received threats by telephone.
Bello believed the attacks against him were because he was forming a trade union with his colleagues in a cleaning company.
Employer points gun at workers: On 10 September in Montevideo, workers at the Alamtec company – which makes electric cables – held a general assembly at their workplace.
When they tried to go back to their posts, the company director, Daniel Justitz, prevented them.
Later, workers' representatives from the metalworkers' union Unión Nacional de Trabajadores del Metal y Ramas Afines (UNTMRA) had a meeting with the director, who told them "Here you come to work and nothing else".
He then pulled out a revolver, smiled, and put it away again.
UNTMRA issued a statement describing the event as a "death threat" against union leaders.
The union had been negotiating in the Ministry of Labour for three months about a dismissal, the non-respect of working conditions, work in the black, the nonpayment of category rises and sexual harassment against women workers in the company.
Abusive and anti-union behaviour at CONAPROLE: In August the Conaprole workers' union – Conaprole is the Uruguayan dairy company – declared it was on "a state of alert" following unilateral measures by the employer who had sanctioned workers for "applying trade union methods".
Botnia subcontractor dismisses trade union leader: A dispute began on 20 December between the Henderson company, a Botnia subcontractor that delivers wood and supplies the woodchip plant, and its workers who threatened to prevent raw materials from entering the factory.
The employees reported anti-union persecution and physical aggression relating to differences in the workplace, which the employer denied.
The strikers reported that the company threw out a leader of the woodworkers' union Sindicato de Obreros de la Industria de la Madera for his trade union activities.

2 Regulation of 28 February 1991 under sections 75 and 83 of the Labour Code, concerning women and young persons' work conditions (ibid., 25 June 1991, No.
13481, p. 2).
4 Regulation of 2 May 1991 under section 131 of the Labour Code, concerning election of the employers' representatives to the Supreme Social Security Council, the High Occupational Safety and Health Council, the Supreme Labour Council, and the International Labour Conference (ibid., 26 June 1991, No.
13482, pp.
3­4).
Concerning individual labour law, it is stipulated that wages, hours, rest and other working conditions be fixed by law (Art.
27 para.
2).
Japanese labour law is established within this constitutional framework.
It is elaborated by acts, ordinances, collective agreements and work rules.
The Civil Code adopted on 27 April 1896 gives a basic definition of employment contracts.
Labour laws must additionally meet constitutional demands by setting minimum labour standards.
There are three major labour laws, namely:
The LSL regulates firstly working conditions and secondly the workplace safety and hygene.
The TUL guarantees the worker's right to organize and to bargain collectively, whereas labour management adjustments and means of dispute settlement are specified in the LRAL.
The LSL was adopted on 7 April 1947 and last amended 30 September 1998.
The TUL was adopted on 1 June 1949 and last amended 12 November 1993.
The LRAL was adopted on 27 September 1946 and last amended 14 June 1988.
The acts apply to Japanese employees of the private sector, with the exception of seafarers, and may also include foreign workers possessing a visa with a work permit.
Concerning those employees who work in public owned enterprises, only the LSL is applicable.
Labour relations of public employees are governed mainly by special provisions according to the relevant category.
Labour legislation is often supplemented by ordinances, which are issued by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (prior to 6 January 2001, this role had been fulfilled by the Ministry of Labour) and the appropriate Labour Relations Commission.
The latter body consists of representatives coming equally from the workers' and employers' ranks as well as from the general public.
Labour legislation also tends to be rather abstract and therefore often needs to be interpreted by ordinary courts, since there are no special labour courts in Japan, and by the Labour Relations Commission.
The second strongest legal norm is the collective agreement, which, in practice, part is, for the most, enterprise based, because it is mainly the enterprise trade union and the respective employer who draw up agreements.
Collective agreements affect primarily those workers of the firm who are trade union members.
According to custom, they tend to be put in writing only as far as is legally required.
Further provisions of the agreement, which must of course be in line with the law, are often simply agreed to verbally.
The written part of the agreements might therefore be simple or vague.
This fact gives more importance to work rules, which stipulate common working conditions at the enterprise level.
Any employer with more than 10 employees must draw them up in consultation with the trade union.
Work rules must not infringe upon the applying collective agreement.
Then, they fix the elements of the labour contracts within the company, independently of whether the individual worker is trade union member or not.
According to the amended Art.
15 of the LSL and its Enforcement Ordinance, contractual matters like wages, working hours and working conditions must be put in writing, when the labour contract is concluded.
In practice, vague contract provisions are nevertheless preferred by the parties so as to have the contract always in line with the work rules and the collective agreement.
Equal treatment of fixed term and permanent contractors is not legally mandated.
Nevertheless, Art.
2 of the LSL provides for a determination of working conditions by workers and employers on an equal basis.
De facto, such determination is strongly influenced by trade unions through collective agreements and work rules, but most of the fixed term contractors are not trade union members and therefore not necessarily covered.
Thus, also the unlawful prolongation of the fixed term contract by repeated renewals does not establish an indefinite-term contract as of a regular employee.
Part-time work is governed by the Part Time Work Law (PTWL) which came into force 18 June 1993.
In the year 2000, 14.7% of all employees worked part-time.
Most of them (91.8%) were women.
The number is increasing (Source: Ministry of Public Management, Home Affairs, Posts and Telecommunication).Part-time workers are defined as workers whose scheduled working hours per week are shorter than those of regular employees in the same workplace (Art.
2). De facto, also quasi part-time workers exist.
They are part-time workers only in name and in law but work long hours.
Part-time workers are considered to be non regular workers, like the fixed term contractors.
Regular pay hikes, bonus payment and retirement allowances thus actually do not apply to them.
However, a protection of part-time workers is intended by the PTWL.
Part-time workers' abilities, for example, should be used effectively and working conditions should be balanced with those of regular employees (Art.
3 para.1).
This is after all no obligation to the employer who is asked only to endeavour.
The only obligation laid down in the PTWL applies to the state, e.g.
the promotion of the part-timers' welfare by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Art.
5).
Many enterprise based collective agreements and work rules establish suspension periods.
A suspension period is a period, during which the labour contract continues to be in force, but the worker has no duty to work and the employer is partly or even completely released from paying wages.
Termination of a labour contract at the worker's and the employer's initiative is governed by Art.
627 of the Civil Code, under which they are free to terminate the contract.
In order to meet the demand of Art.
27 of the Constitution to promote job security as a public matter, the employer's dismissal is limited predominantly by the LSL, court rulings and collective agreements.
This restriction applies to unlimited labour contracts as well as to those contracts of a definite period which have continued for longer than the period prescribed by law.
trade union activities guaranteed by Art.
28 Constitution (Art.
7 of the TUL)
On the employee's request, the employer shall deliver a certificate stating reasons for dismissal without delay (Art.
22 of the LSL).
In case of an illegal dismissal, the court orders the continuance of the labour contract and the employee is reinstated.
The employee also may claim damages instead.
For further details please refer to Termination of Employment Digest.
The average working time as stipulated in Article 32 of the LSL is 40 hours per week and 8 hours per day.
These limits may be relaxed for a definite period, which is defined by agreement of the employer and the enterprise trade union or, if such union does not exist, a worker representing a majority of workers.
There may be different forms of a flexible working time, which are confined by ordinances.
In any case, the average working time during the agreed period must not exceed 40 hours per week (Art.
32-4 of the LSL).
The employer must also provide at least one rest day per week as well as rest periods during working hours, at least 45 minutes after 6 working hours and one hour after 8 working hours (Arts.
34 and 35 of the LSL).
Night work against increased wages is legally permitted but cannot be ordered to those workers who are raising a child and request to be excepted.
Overtime work may also be stipulated by agreement of the employer and the trade union.
Increased wages must then be paid within a range of no less than 25% and no more than 50% over the normal wage per working hour (Art.
37 of the LSL).
On the numbers of hours worked overtime, there is no statutory limit, except for female workers responsible for the care of children and senior workers who must receive special protection.
The Ministry of Labour, however, is entitled to set a standard limit, by which employers and trade unions shall endeavour to abide.
In fact, the number of hours worked overtime is decreasing.
In 1998, it decreased to 134 per average worker (source: Labour Situation in Japan 2000, The Japan Institute of Labour).
The exceptional case of a discretionary work scheme applies to legally specified professionals including highly qualified white collar workers.
For the application of this scheme, means of accomplishment and allocation of time must be left largely to the discretion of the employee (Art.
38- 4 of the LSL).
No overtime premium is paid and the number of working hours is stipulated by the above mentioned agreement regardless of any legal limitation.
Maternity protection is regulated by the LSL.
During pregnancy and up to one year after childbirth, a ban is put on heavy physical work and on work with dangerous materials (Art.
64-5). Upon request, the expectant or nursing mother has the right to refuse overtime or night time work and may ask for light work as well.
The Constitution puts a ban on child labour (Art.
27 para.3).
This is elaborated in the LSL.
Children under 15 full years must not be employed, except for those working for motion picture production and theatrical performances (Art.
56). Children under age 18 may be employed outside of school hours in light labour that is not be dangerous or harmful.
Underground work is also forbidden.
Discrimination on the basis of race, creed, gender, social status or family origin is banned already by Constitution (Art.
14). This prohibition is elaborated in the LSL (Arts.
3 and 4) and in view of gender also by the Equal Employment Opportunity Act (EEOA).
Female and male employees are subject to the same regulations in terms of overtime, night work and rest days.
With respect to wages, gender discrimination is prohibited by the LSL (Art.
4). Discriminatory recruitment, hiring, assignment and promotion are inhibited on the basis of the EEOA (Arts.
5 and 6).
Any violation may be publicized by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Art.
26 of the EEOA).
The EEOA also prohibits sexual harassment and its observance must be supervised by the employer (Art.
21 para.1).
The freedom of workers' associations is granted in Art.
28 of the Constitution.
Trade unions are ruled in the Trade Union Law (TUL) and defined as those organisations, which are formed autonomously and composed mainly of workers for the main purposes of maintaining and improving working conditions and raising the economic status of workers (Art.
2). Legally covered are all workers, except for those either with a supervisory position or working for welfare or political and social movements (Art.
2 paras.
1, 3 and 4).
De facto, non-regular workers - temporary and part-time employees - are also mostly not unionized.
The trade union's constitution must inter alia include the members' right to participate in all affairs and prohibit the disqualification for union membership on the basis of race, religion, gender, social status or family origin (Art.
5 - 2).Trade unions meeting all conditions are registered by the Labour Relations Commission and then they gain a legal personality as well as legal protection.
This covers protection against unfair labour practices (Art.
7). Any discrimination because of trade union activities is forbidden, and the employer must not have any influence on the trade union's management.
The employer is also not entitled to refuse to bargain collectively without proper reason.
In 1999, 1,1700,000 workers of the private sector were unionized.
The unionization rate has been declining during the last 50 years.
In 1997, it was at 22.6 % (Source: The Japan Institute of Labour, The Labour Situation in Japan 2000).
Over 90% of the unions are formed within the limits of one company.
These enterprise unions engage in activities and issues related to their members within the enterprise.
However, most of the enterprise unions in the same industry are affiliated to industry federations such as the Confederation of Japan Automobile Workers and the Japanese Electronic and Information Union.
Industry federations are generally constituents of the nation-wide Japanese Trade Union Confederation (Rengo).
Rengo, which was founded in 1989, absorbed rival national organisations and embraces now unions of the private as well as from the public sector.
Its competitor of much smaller size and politically more to the left is the National Confederation of Trade Unions (Zenroren).
The industry federations and also the nation-wide confederation are in charge with the discussion and the advice on general policies like wages or working conditions.
Employers' organisations are not covered by the TUL, even though there are a number which impact on the role of employers.
The Japanese Federation of Employers' Associations (Nikkeiren) plays a main role on behalf of employers in industrial relations.
It has no direct part in collective bargaining but sets guidelines to employers and thus actually influences labour issues.
It is also the official voice of Japanese employers in the International Labour Organisation (ILO).
According to Art.
14 of the TUL, parties to collective bargaining must be, on one side, a trade union and, on the other, either the employer or an employers' association.
In practice, collective bargaining is mostly enterprise based.
The employer must bargain with the appropriate trade union in good faith (Art.
7 para.
2 of the TUL).
According to the Supreme Court's decision, this applies also in favour of a trade union representing dispatched workers, if it wants to bargain with the client company regarding dispatched work related working conditions (668 Rodo Hanrei 11; Sup.Ct.
Feb. 28, 1995).
Further regulation of the collective bargaining process may be found in respective enterprise based collective agreements, which often oblige employers to consult the trade union.
In Japan, consultation is regarded as a peaceful attempt to reach convergence, whereas collective bargaining is recognized as a confrontation.
Often, collective bargaining can barely be distinguished from strike actions.
Joint consultation may take place prior to collective bargaining or may replace it in management policies that do not provide for the possibility of bargaining.
In some cases, even formal consultative committees are set up.
Written and signed collective agreements may have different terms of validity, but must not exceed three years (Art.
15 of the TUL).
Only those agreements in which no term of validity is provided for can be terminated at either party's initiative at any time (Art.
15-3 of the TUL).
A collective agreement, which had ended, is basically no longer effective, but the parties may agree that it should remain in force until a new collective agreement is concluded.
All collective agreements apply primarily to those employees who are trade union members.
If in one workplace, three-fourths of comparable workers fall under a collective agreement, this agreement applies to all workers of the same kind within the workplace (Art.
17 of the TUL).
A collective agreement may have general binding power even in a whole locality, which is actually an exception (Art.
18 of the TUL).
This requires that the agreement applies to a particular locality, not only to a firm, and a majority of comparable workers is bound.
Further, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare must upon request of either party and pursuant to a resolution of the Labour Relations Commission declare the agreement as binding to all workers of the same kind.
Collective agreements have a normative effect on work rules and labour contracts.
Work rules must not infringe upon the collective agreement (Art.
92 of the LSL) and any labour contract's provision that contravenes the standards set by the agreement is null and void (Art.
16 of the TUL).
A majority interprets these rules not as the setting of minimum standards but as the establishment of a pattern, which should be followed in every respect.
Collective agreements additionally establish duties and rights to the contractual parties- mostly the employer and the enterprise trade union.
The employer has always the obligation of executing what is to be understood as an obligation to provide conditions according to the collective agreement.
In many cases, further duties are imposed like the employer's obligation to consult the trade union.
Within the enterprise, workers are usually represented by an enterprise trade union organized by a majority of the workers.
Its members are elected out of the own workers' ranks.
The election as well as the term of office is ruled in the trade union's constitution.
If such a trade union does not exist, the interest of the workers' majority must be represented by a single worker.
Workers' representation is of considerable importance in the drawing up of work rules, which the employer is obliged to do as soon as 10 or more workers are continuously employed (Art.
89 of the LSL).
Before drawing up work rules the employer has to consult the trade union or the representing employee (Art.
90-1 of the LSL) .
The given statement then needs to be attached, when the employer submits the work rules to the Labour Standards Inspection Office (Art.
90-2 of the LSL).
Article 28 of the Constitution guarantees the workers' right to act collectively, which includes labour disputes.
Labour disputes are defined in the Labour Relations Adjustment Law (LRAL) as "a disagreement over claims regarding labour relations arising between the parties concerned with labour relations resulting in either the occurrence of acts of dispute or the danger of such occurrence" (Art.
6). For labour disputes, the trade union and its members are liable neither under civil law nor under penal law, as long as they act properly (Arts.
8 and 1 para.
2 of the TUL).
This requires firstly that it is a legally registered trade union that acts and secondly that no violence is used (Art.1 para.
2 of the TUL).
Legally recognized are the acts of dispute mentioned in Art.
7 of the LRAL, such as strikes, slowdowns and other acts hampering the normal course of work, like the order to all workers to take holiday on the same day or the posting of posters on the establishments premises.
Also shutting down the flow of traffic through the gates is a legal form of labour dispute, as long as it is peaceful.
All acts must additionally be for a lawful purpose, which is surely the achievement of better working conditions.
The workers are paid no wages while striking.
Labour disputes can be settled upon request of one or both parties by conciliation, mediation or arbitration.
Each form of settlement is strongly influenced by the Labour Relations Commission, a body representing equally workers, employers and the public.
The Labour Relations Commission exists on a prefectural and on a second, national level.
On this second level, the Central Labour Relations Commission reviews dispositions of the prefectural commissions but also assumes exclusive jurisdiction in cases of national enterprises (Art.
25 paras.
2 and 3 of the TUL).
Members of the prefectural level are appointed as recommended by trade unions and employers' organisations, whereas members of the central commission are appointed by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare.
The most feeble form of settlement is the conciliation by one or more conciliators nominated by the Labour Relations Commission.
A conciliator must be a person with experience in the settlement of labour disputes (Art.
11 of the LRAL).
He/She acts as an intermediaries between the parties (Art.
13 of the LRAL).
In the event of not being able to effect a settlement, the conciliator must withdraw and then report the confidential facts of the case to the Labour Relations Commission (Art.
14 of the LRAL).
Stronger than the conciliation is the mediation, which is carried out by a mediation committee representing workers, employers and the public in equal number.
The committee, which is nominated by the Labour Relations Commission's chairperson, has the power to draft a proposal of the settlement (Art.
26 of the LRAL).
It can also put pressure on the acceptance of the proposal with the help of the press.
Arbitration is the strongest and actually most rarely chosen form of labour dispute settlement.
An arbitration committee from among the members of the Labour Relations Commission is nominated by the commission's chairperson.
The arbitration committee meets and listens to other members of the Labour Relations Commission representing employers and workers (Art.
31-5 of the LRAL).
It finally takes a decision in writing - known as an arbitration award - which has the same effect as a collective agreement (Art.
34 of the LRAL).
Labour disputes are settled as labour related civil cases.
Settlements are regulated by the Civil Procedure Code from 1890, which was reformed in 1996, effective 1 January 1998, in order to shorten procedures.
If the employee complains about unfair labour practices, the Labour Relations Commission has jurisdiction (Art.
27 of the TUL).
The decision of the Prefectural Labour Relations Commission is upon request reviewed by the Central Labour Relations Commission.
Either party then may file an appeal to the court.

Labor, United States Department of, federal executive department established in 1913 and charged with administering and enforcing statutes that promote the welfare of U.S. wage earners, improve their working conditions, and advance their opportunities for profitable employment.
Before gaining separate cabinet status in 1913, labor had been represented by various federal agencies.
The first such agency was established in 1884 as the Bureau of Labor within the Dept.
of the Interior.
In 1888 an independent department was created, but in 1903 labor was placed in the new Dept.
of Commerce and Labor, which was reorganized as two cabinet-level departments in 1913.
The Dept.
of Labor has eight major specialized divisions: the Bureau of International Labor Affairs, the Employment and Training Administration, the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, the Employment Standards Administration, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Mine Safety and Health Administration, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the Veterans' Employment and Training Service.
A ninth division, the Office of the American Workplace, established in 1993, was terminated when congress failed to provide the necessary appropriations.
The Bureau of International Labor Affairs deals with the interaction among U.S. foreign policy, foreign labor developments, and U.S. labor developments.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics, a direct descendant of the 1884 Bureau of Labor, gathers data in the field of labor economics.
The agencies of the Employment Standards Administration administer federal labor legislation and the administration conducts research to support their programs; the agencies (and the legislation they administer) include the Wage and Hour Division (minimum wage and fringe benefits) and the Office of Worker's Compensation Programs (compensation for job-related injuries).
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration is responsible for ensuring the best possible U.S. working conditions in terms of safety and health.
The Women's Bureau promotes the employment, efficiency, and welfare of wage-earning women.
The Department of Labor (DOL) administers federal labor laws for the executive branch of the federal government.
Its mission is "to foster, promote, and develop the welfare of the wage earners of the United States, to improve their working conditions, and to advance their opportunities for profitable employment" (29 U.S.C.A.
§ 551 [1985]).
The DOL was created in 1913 out of four bureaus from the Department of Commerce and Labor: the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Bureau of Immigration, Bureau of Naturalization, and Children's Bureau.
The DOL is headed by the secretary of labor, who serves in the president's cabinet .
The department's numerous responsibilities include administering and enforcing federal labor laws guaranteeing workers' rights to safe and healthful working conditions, a minimum hourly wage and overtime pay, freedom from employment discrimination, unemployment insurance, and workers' compensation.
The department protects workers' pension rights, provides for job training programs, helps workers find jobs, and works to strengthen the collective bargaining process.
It keeps track of changes in employment, prices, and other economic measurements.
The DOL also makes special efforts to address the unique job market problems of minorities, women, children, the elderly, disabled persons, and so on.
Seven major agencies operate within the DOL: the Employment and Training Administration, Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, Employment Standards Administration, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Mine Safety and Health Administration, Bureau of Labor Statistics, and Veterans' Employment and Training Service.
Other organizations, including the Women's Bureau, Office of the American Workplace, and Bureau of International Labor Affairs, also function within the department.
The Employment and Training Administration (ETA) administers five major programs that relate to employment services, job training, and unemployment insurance.
The ETA also administers a federal-state employment security system, funds and oversees programs to provide work experience and training for groups having difficulty entering or returning to the workforce, and formulates and promotes apprenticeship standards and programs.
The Federal Unemployment Insurance Service (FUIS) oversees the Federal-State Unemployment Compensation Program under provisions of the Social Security Act of 1935 (42 U.S.C.A.
§ 1305).
This program provides income support for unemployed workers.
Because unemployment benefits are payable under laws of individual states, the FUIS is primarily an oversight organization providing leadership and policy guidance to the states.
The Employment Standards Administration administers minimum wage and overtime standards through its Wage and Hour Division.
This division seeks to protect low-wage incomes as provided by the minimum wage provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (29 U.S.C.A.
§ 201), and to discourage excessively long hours of work through the enforcement of the overtime provisions of the act.
The division also determines the prevailing wage rates for federal construction contracts and federally assisted programs for construction, alteration, and repair of public works subject to the Davis- Bacon Act (40 U.S.C.A.
§ 276a) and related acts.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has responsibility for occupational safety and health activities.
OSHA was established by the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C.A.
§ 651 et seq.).
It develops and issues occupational safety and health standards for various industries and occupations.
OSHA also formulates and publishes regulations that employers are to follow in maintaining health and safety.
It conducts investigations and inspections to determine compliance with these standards and regulations, and if it finds noncompliance, it may issue citations and propose penalties.
The MSHA develops and promulgates mandatory safety and health standards for the mining industry, inspects mines to ensure compliance, investigates mining accidents, and assesses fines for violations of its regulations.
It helps the states develop effective state mine safety and health programs.
The MSHA also conducts research on mine safety, in the hope of preventing and reducing mine accidents and occupational diseases.
The Women's Bureau formulates standards and policies that promote the welfare of wage earning women, improve their working conditions, increase their efficiency, and advance their opportunities for profitable employment.
The United States Department of Labor is a Cabinet department of the United States government responsible for occupational safety, wage and hour standards, unemployment insurance benefits, re-employment services, and some economic statistics.
Many U.S. states also have such departments.
The department is headed by the United States Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis is the current Secretary of Labor.
Seth Harris is the current Deputy Secretary of Labor .
The purpose of the Department of Labor (DOL) is to foster, promote, and develop the welfare of the wage earners, job seekers, and retirees of the United States; improve working conditions; advance opportunities for profitable employment; and assure work-related benefits and rights.
In carrying out this mission, the Department of Labor administers and enforces more than 180 federal laws.
These mandates and the regulations that implement them cover many workplace activities for about 10 million employers and 125 million workers.
An employer is a person or institution that hires employees or workers.
There are federal rules which determine whether an employee can be classified as exempt or non exempt from over time.
Once an employee has been properly classified as exempt or not exempt, an Employer may offer hourly wages or a salary .
It is important to note that "salary" does not always mean "exempt from overtime requirements.
" A properly classified, as exempt, salaried employee is typically not paid more for more hours worked and employers may not deduct wages for items such as lack of work or because the employee worked less hours due to no fault of their own.
Employees, that are not exempt, must be paid overtime.
They are most often referred to as "hourly employees.
" The federal rule for overtime for all hourly employees is: Hourly employees that work more than 40 hours in a set and predetermined 24 hour and 7 consecutive day period must be paid 1.5 times their regular rate of pay for all hours over 40.
Under no circumstance may either the employer or employee waive the over time requirement.
Additionally, many states have their own individual requirements about when and how over time is to be paid.
In general, when there are both federal and state laws that apply to the same employment issue, such as Over Time, the law that treats the employee the best or with most favor, is the law that governs.
Employees can organize into trade unions or labor unions, who represent most of the available work force in a single organization.
They utilize their representative power to collectively bargain with the management of companies in order to advance concerns and demands of their membership.
In the United States , the standard employment relationship is considered to be at-will meaning that the employer and employee are both free to terminate the employment at any time and for any cause, or for no cause at all.
However, if a termination of employment [3] by the employer is deemed unjust by the employee, there can be legal recourse to challenge such a termination.
Unjust termination may include termination due to discrimination because of an individual's race, national origin, sex or gender, pregnancy, age, physical or mental disability, religion, or military status.
Additional protections apply in some states, for instance in California unjust termination reasons include marital status, ancestry, sexual orientation or medical condition.
Despite whatever agreement an employer makes with an employee for the employee's wages, an employee is entitled to certain minimum wages set by the federal government .
The states may set their own minimum wage that is higher than the federal government's to ensure a higher standard of living or living wage for their residents.
Under the Equal Pay Act of 1963 an employer may not give different wages based on sex alone.
[4]
Employees are often contrasted with independent contractors , especially when there is dispute as to the worker's entitlement to have matching taxes paid, workers compensation , and unemployment insurance benefits.
However, in September 2009, the court case of Brown v. J. Kaz, Inc. ruled that independent contractors are regarded as employees for the purpose of discrimination laws if they work for the employer on a regular basis, and said employer directs the time, place, and manner of employment.
[5]
In unionized work environments in particular, employees who are receiving discipline , up to and including termination of employment can ask for assistance by their shop steward to advocate on behalf of the employee.
If an informal negotiation between the shop steward and the company does not resolve the issue, the shop steward may file a grievance , which can result in a resolution within the company, or mediation or arbitration , which are typically funded equally both by the union and the company.
There are no laws about minimum salary in Sweden.
Instead there are agreements between employer organisations and trade unions about minimum salaries, and other employment conditions.
Capitalism demarcates "work" as something that is supplied by "owners" and demanded by "non owners" to a great degree.
In this viewpoint, the risk associated with owning and operating a business is seen as fairly rewarding the risk-taker with the lion's share of profits, even though in reality the lion's share of the "work" to provide the good or service is provided at the worker level.
Unsafe and unfair work conditions and a lack of profit-share are among the key factors that contributed to the establishment of unions.
Example: Collins, a real estate salesperson, is an independent contractor engaged by Broker Baker.
She has not received any income in the last 3 months but is unable to collect unemployment insurance because she is an independent contractor.
Last year she paid a self-employment tax instead of social security.
Congress and the states have enacted numerous laws geared toward protecting employees.
The National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C.A.
§ 152(3)) protects employees and union members from unfair bargaining practices; title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C.A.
§ 2000 et seq.
) protects employees from discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion, and national origin; the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (20 U.S.C.A.
§ 623) protects employees from age discrimination ; the Fair Labor Standards Act (29 U.S.C.A.
§ 203) establishes minimum wage and overtime standards; the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C.A.
§ 1002) ensures the security of employee retirement funds; and the Occupational Safety and Health Act (29 U.S.C.A.
§ 652) protects employees from environmental work hazards.
Most states also have unemployment and workers' compensation laws, which obligate employers to pay, directly or indirectly, for medical treatment or lost wages, or both, for employees who are injured while at work or who lose their job.
None of these laws protect independent contractors.
And because compliance often comes at great expense, employers can significantly reduce their liability and increase their profit margin by hiring independent contractors rather than employees.
Although not protected by law to the extent of an employee, an independent contractor has far greater control over elements such as work hours and work methods.
Unlike most employees, an independent contractor may opt to work at night or on weekends, leaving weekdays free.
An independent contractor may choose to wear blue jeans or a business suit, take one week of vacation or thirty weeks, or interrupt work to attend a child's school play or to go to the beach.
Moreover, although the other contracting party retains control over the finished work product, an independent contractor has exclusive control over the actual work process.
Decisions such as whether to work for one person or several, whether to work a little or a lot, whether to accept or reject an undesirable work project, and how much money to charge are made by the independent contractor.
If a worker is working substantially full-time for an employer, the worker is presumably not free to do work for other employers and is therefore an employee.
Generally speaking, independent contractors retain control over their schedule and number of hours worked, jobs accepted, and performance of their job.
This contrasts with the situation for regular employees, who usually work at the schedule required by the employer and whose performance is directly supervised by the employer.
However many companies (particularly in the freight transport industry) specify the contractor's schedule, require purchase of vehicles from the company and prohibit work for other companies.
There are several monetary incentives that are guaranteed to employees in the United States , but not independent contractors.
Examples include worker's compensation and unemployment insurance .
The main sources of law for termination of employment in Spain are the Workers’ Charter, [1] Royal Decree 2546/1994 of 29 December on recruitment, and Royal Legislative Decree 2/1995, which adopts the text which is recast in the Labour Procedure Act (LPA).
In addition, art.
35 of the Spanish Constitution states that “all Spaniards have the duty to work and the right to work, to the free selection of their profession or office career, to advancement through work and to sufficient remuneration to satisfy their needs and those of their family, while in no case can there be discrimination for reasons of sex”.
Some collective agreements also deal with this subject.
In 1985, Spain ratified the ILO Termination of Employment Convention, 1982 (No.
158).
resignation by the worker, upon the submission of notice provided for in the applicable collective agreements or by local practice;
Substantial modifications of working conditions, which affect the worker’s vocational training or dignity;
The employment contract may be terminated by the employer through dismissal based on serious and culpable non-performance on the part of the worker (disciplinary dismissal).
The following are considered non-performance of contractual obligations (sec.
54, Workers’ Charter):
Collective dismissal is classified as the termination of employment contracts based on economic, technical, organizational or productive reasons within a period of 90 days, which affects at least (sec.
51, Workers’ Charter):
The termination of employment contracts of the undertaking’s entire workforce of five or more workers is also considered a collective dismissal.
In Spain, the anti-discrimination provisions of the Workers’ Charter prohibit termination of employment on the basis of sex, ethnic origin, marital status, race, social status, religious or political beliefs, membership or non-membership of a trade union, or language (secs.
4(2) and 17(1), Workers’ Charter).
To this is added protection contained in the Act on Social Integration of the Disabled (No.
12/1982 of 31 March 1982), which extends this protection to disability status.
Any termination of employment based on the above-mentioned grounds is considered to be null and void.
In addition, a termination is null in the following cases: pregnant workers during the period of suspension of the contract due to maternity, risk during pregnancy, or breast-feeding leave; adoption or fostering; family leave to care for children or handicapped persons; and in certain circumstances female workers who have been victim of gender violence.
[8] The worker may be reinstated or paid his or her wages indefinitely, including continued coverage by the social security system (sec.
12, LPA), without prejudice to other possible civil liability to which the employer may be subject.
Termination of the employment contract for objective reasons requires the observance of the following criteria (sec.
53(1), Workers’ Charter):
In the case of termination of employment for misconduct, the dismissal must be notified in writing to the worker, stating the facts justifying the dismissal and indicating the date on which the employment relationship will end (sec.
55(1), Workers’ Charter).
If the worker is a workers’ legal representative or a trade union representative, there will be formal adversarial procedures during which the worker concerned, and other members of the union to which he or she belongs, may be heard.
If the worker happens to be a member of a trade union and the employer is aware of this fact, representatives of the corresponding trade union must be heard in advance.
An employer who intends to carry out collective dismissals must request permission from the competent labour authority and at the same time must consult the legal representative of the workers.
The communication to the labour authority and to the legal representatives must be accompanied by all the necessary documentation justifying the reasons for the dismissal and the measures which are to be adopted, in the terms prescribed by regulation.
Once the request has been received by the labour authority, it will ascertain whether the request fulfils the necessary requirements, and if it does not, the employer must rectify the situation within ten days (sec.
51(2) and (3), Workers’ Charter).
Consultation with the legal representatives of the workers should last not less than 30 calendar days, or a fortnight in the case of enterprises employing fewer than 50 workers (sec.
51(4), Workers’ Charter).
At the end of the process of consultation, the employer must communicate to the labour authority the outcome of the deliberations.
If there is an agreement between the parties, the labour authority must hand down a decision within a fortnight.
However, if the labour authority determines, ex officio or at the request of the party concerned, the commission of fraud, damage, coercion or abuse of law in the conclusion of the agreement, it will submit its decision to the judicial authority, with a suspension of the time limit to make the decision (sec.
51(5), Workers’ Charter).
In the event that the period of consultation is concluded without agreement, the labour authority must hand down a decision within a period of 15 calendar days.
The decision of the labour authority must be justified and compatible with the wishes of the enterprise (sec.
51(6), Workers’ Charter).
Collective dismissal leads to severance payments equal to compensation of 20 days’ wages for each year of service, up to a maximum of 12 months’ pay (for periods of under a year, this is prorated by the number of months of service) (sec.
51(8), Workers’ Charter).
In undertakings employing fewer than 25 workers, the Wage Guarantee Fund must pay 40 per cent of the legal compensation due to the workers (sec.
33(8), Workers’ Charter).
If the employer does not fulfil the requirements established under sec.
53(1), the decision to terminate employment will be declared null and void, [12] and the employer will be instructed to pay the worker, according to the provisions applicable in the event of disciplinary dismissal (sec.
53(4), Workers’ Charter).
The wages due during the period of deliberations may not be deducted from the wages corresponding to the notice period (sec.
123(2), LPA).
The judicial body, ex officio or at the request of the party concerned, will declare null and void the agreement taken by the employer to effect collective dismissal for economic, technical, organizational or productive reasons, force majeure or extinction of the legal personality of the employer if prior administrative authorization has not been obtained (sec.
124, LPA).
In such cases the ruling will be determined by sec.
113 of the LPA, namely, reinstatement of the worker with payment of outstanding wages.
[12] Failure to give notice will not annul the termination, but the employer will be obliged to pay wages corresponding to the period in question.
A contract of employment is a category of contract used in labour law to attribute right and responsibilities between parties to a bargain.
On the one end stands an "employee" who is "employed" by an "employer".
It has arisen out of the old master-servant law, used before the 20th century.
Put generally, the contract of employment denotes a relationship of economic dependence and social subordination.
In the words of the influential labour lawyer Sir Otto Kahn-Freund ,
"the relation between an employer and an isolated employee or worker is typically a relation between a bearer of power and one who is not a bearer of power.
In its inception it is an act of submission, in its operation it is a condition of subordination, however much the submission and the subordination may be concealed by the indispensable figment of the legal mind known as the 'contract of employment'.
The main object of labour law has been, and... will always be a countervailing force to counteract the inequality of bargaining power which is inherent and must be inherent in the employment relationship.
" [1]
Normally, such contracts provide for termination of employment, by either party, and include associated matters such as notice period, compensation arrangements and, sometimes, garden leave .
Traditionally, a temporary employee is hired to substitute for an employee who is on leave or vacation or to staff a project for which there are insufficient permanent employees to carry out the task.
A seasonal employee is hired for the limited time because the work is only necessary for a certain season.
The normal practice of temporary employment for an agency is one in which the employees have a close relationship with the agency from which they receive their pay.
Their work may range from day labor to high-priced consulting .
The employee may work for one or several companies, and the working periods may be for days or months at a time, but the working periods come about irregularly.
Temporary agencies may or may not provide benefits , such as subsidized health insurance , to their employees.
However, it is relatively common for such workers to draw higher pay in exchange for not receiving the benefits afforded to the regulars.
The most abusive permatemp employment situation results when a worker classified as temporary works alongside regular employees doing similar work for a long period, usually without comparable benefits, thereby exploiting loopholes in business law.
By claiming the employee as temporary, the employer avoids paying for benefits and possibly pays a lower hourly wage.
The employer also tangentially benefits because it has no direct responsibility to the employee.
Permatemp employees can be fired or laid off at any time, as they have no career service protection or seniority.
In addition, all costs, including the markup from the temp agency, are deductible as Schedule A ( Form 1040 ) purchase of subcontractor services to the client employer.
When a company requires a break in service of its permatemps, the result is often that those employees regularly cycle between two companies instead of having back-to-back assignments.
Other permatemps plan for personal breaks and simply use the time as vacation.
In most cases, they are eligible for unemployment insurance as long as they nominally look for work.
This form of permatemping may be attractive to those not wanting a steady, full-time, or year-round position, or not wanting to be committed to one position or one employer.
Frequently permatemps are highly skilled, excellent workers, particularly in the IT field, but are still not allowed to participate in company events or receive bonuses for work well done.
If they earn over the United States Department of Labor minimum for overtime exemption, they may be asked to put in similar overtime hours to benefitted, salaried employees without overtime compensation.
Depending on the staffing firm and corporation policies, permatemps may discover themselves in one of several positions, all of which require the same level of work from them as from their coworkers:
An arrangement by which employees may set their own work schedules, especially their starting and finishing hours.
Also called flexitime.
flextime, system of assigning hours for work that permits employees to choose, within specified limits, the hours that they will be at their place of employment.
In many companies, there is a "core time" when all employees must be present each workday.
By allowing employees to stagger hours or by changing from five eight-hour days to four ten-hour days (a "compressed work week"), traffic and commuting problems are eased, parents can adjust work schedules to school schedules, and expensive office equipment, such as computers, can be used more efficiently.
In 1997 about 25 million full-time workers (about 15.1% of the U.S. workforce) had flexible schedules.
One variation on flextime is job sharing, in which two employees share the duties of one job by splitting the weekly work hours associated with the job.
Some flextime programs permit employees to work some hours at home; this can include telecommuting , that is, using the telephone and a home personal computer equipped with a modem to conduct business and stay in contact with the office.
Flextime (or flexitime, flexi-time, originally derived from the German word Gleitzeit which literally means 'sliding time') is a variable work schedule , in contrast to traditional[ citation needed ] work arrangements requiring employees to work a standard 9am to 5pm day .
Its invention is usually credited to William Henning.
Under flextime, there is typically a core period (of approximately 50% of total working time/working day) of the day when employees are expected to be at work (for example, between 11 am and 3pm), while the rest of the working day is "flexitime", in which employees can choose when they work, subject to achieving total daily, weekly or monthly hours in the region of what the employer expects, and subject to the necessary work being done.
Shift workers are generally excluded from flexitime schemes as are senior managers.
Other groups of workers for whom flexitime arrangements are rare include those who serve the public during specific opening times.
For employers, flexitime can aid the recruitment and retention of staff.
It has been a particularly popular option in 2009 for employers trying to reduce staff costs without having to make redundancies during the recession.
It can also help provide staff cover outside normal working hours and reduce the need for overtime .
Additionally flexitime can also improve the provision of equal opportunities to staff unable to work standard hours.
In the United States , flextime workers, like salaried workers exempted from overtime regulations, are given broad leeway in setting their own work schedule.
Unlike exempted salaried workers, employers are still required to pay overtime to a flextime worker if they work more than 40 hours per week; some employers avoid this policy by dismissing[ citation needed ] their employees shortly before their scheduled working hours have been completed.
In addition, the employer will usually require that a flextime employee works a minimum number of hours each week.
In recent years, the term "flextime" has acquired a more controversial definition when used to describe proposals to overhaul the nation's overtime regulations.
Under one such proposal by the Bush administration made public on August 5, 2004, employers would not be required to pay non-exempt employees overtime for working more than 40 hours in a week so long as the employee works no more than 80 hours over a two week period.
For example, a worker could be required to work 70 hours one week and receive no overtime compensation as long as they work 10 hours or less the following week.
Such arrangements are opposed by labor organizations such as the AFL-CIO .
Flextime in Australia is usually referred to accumulated overtime hours that an employee can build up and exchange for the equivalent amount of time off.
(Example: Jane works 7am - 3pm Monday to Friday.
Over the past month, Jane has worked 8 hours overtime meaning she is eligible for a paid day off.
) It is implemented formally in the Australian Federal Public Service and is available for staff in most state and territory government departments.
With current changes to industrial relations laws (2006), from State to Federal level there are no new published guidelines (online) for flextime.
Each of Australia's states celebrates the improvements that have been made in working conditions with its own Labor Day .
The Eight-Hour Day holiday is marked with parades and celebrations to commemorate trade union efforts to limit working hours.
In many places, people still chant the unions' slogan: "Eight hours' labor, eight hours' recreation, and eight hours' rest!," which, by happenstance, is the basis of St. Benedict's Rule of Life for religious orders.
The eight-hour day movement or 40-hour week movement, also known as the short-time movement, had its origins in the Industrial Revolution in Britain , where industrial production in large factories transformed working life and imposed long hours and poor working conditions.
With working conditions unregulated, the health, welfare and morale of working people suffered.
The use of child labour was common.
The working day could range from 10 to 16 hours for six days a week.
[1] [2]
Robert Owen had raised the demand for a ten-hour day in 1810, and instituted it in his socialist enterprise at New Lanark .
By 1817 he had formulated the goal of the eight-hour day and coined the slogan Eight hours labour, Eight hours recreation, Eight hours rest.
Women and children in England were granted the ten-hour day in 1847.
French workers won the 12-hour day after the February revolution of 1848.
A shorter working day and improved working conditions were part of the general protests and agitation for Chartist reforms and the early organization of trade unions .
The Australian gold rushes attracted many skilled tradesmen to Australia.
Some of these trades people had been active in the chartism movement, and subsequently became prominent in agitation for better working conditions in the Australian colonies.
It took further campaigning and struggles by trade unions to extend the reduction in hours to all workers in Australia.
In 1916 the New South Wales Eight Hours Act was passed granting the eight-hour day to all workers in the state.
The eight-hour day was not achieved nationally until the 1920s.
The Commonwealth Arbitration Court gave approval of the 40-hour five-day working week nationally beginning on 1 January 1948.
The achievement of the eight-hour day has been described by historian Rowan Cahill as one of the great successes of the Australian working class during the nineteenth century, demonstrating to Australian workers that it was possible to successfully organize, mobilize, agitate, and exercise significant control over working conditions and quality of life.
The Australian trade union movement grew out of eight-hour campaigning and the movement that developed to promote the principle.
In 1884, Tom Mann joined the Social Democratic Federation (SDF) and published a pamphlet calling for the working day to be limited to eight hours.
Mann formed an organization, the Eight Hour League, which successfully pressured the Trades Union Congress to adopt the eight-hour day as a key goal.
In Iran in 1918, the work of reorganizing the trade unions began in earnest in Tehran during the closure of the Iranian constitutional parliament Majles .
The printers' union, established in 1906 by Mohammad Parvaneh as the first trade union, in the Koucheki print shop on Nasserieh Avenue in Tehran , reorganized their union under leadership of Russian-educated Seyed Mohammad Dehgan, a newspaper editor and an avowed Communist.
In 1918, the newly-organized union staged a 14-day strike and succeeded in reaching a collective agreement with employers to institute the eight-hours day, overtime pay, and medical care.
The success of the printers' union encouraged other trades to organize.
In 1919 the bakers and textile-shop clerks formed their own trade unions.
However the eight-hours day only became as code by a limited governor’s decree on 1923 by the governor of Kerman, Sistan and Baluchistan, which controlled the working conditions and working hours for workers of carpet workshops in the province.
In 1946 the council of ministers issued the first labor law for Iran, which recognized the eight-hour day.
Promoted by Samuel Duncan Parnell as early as 1840, when carpenter Samuel Parnell refused to work more than eight hours a day when erecting a store for merchant George Hunter .
He successfully negotiated this working condition and campaigned for its extension in the infant Wellington community.
A meeting of Wellington carpenters in October 1840 pledged "to maintain the eight-hour working day, and that anyone offending should be ducked into the harbour".
New Zealand is reputed to be the first country in the world to have adopted the eight-hour working day.
The leadership of the Knights of Labor , under Terence V. Powderly , rejected appeals to join the movement as a whole, but many local Knights assemblies joined the strike call including Chicago, Cincinnati and Milwaukee.
On May 1, 1886, Albert Parsons, head of the Chicago Knights of Labor , with his wife Lucy Parsons and two children, led 80,000 people down Michigan Avenue, Chicago, in what is regarded as the first modern May Day Parade, in support of the eight-hour day.
In the next few days they were joined nationwide by 350,000 workers who went on strike at 1,200 factories, including 70,000 in Chicago, 45,000 in New York, 32,000 in Cincinnati, and additional thousands in other cities.
Some workers gained shorter hours (eight or nine) with no reduction in pay; others accepted pay cuts with the reduction in hours.
The United States Adamson Act in 1916 established an eight-hour day, with additional pay for overtime, for railroad workers.
This was the first federal law that regulated the hours of workers in private companies.
The United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Act in Wilson v. New, 243 U.S. 332 (1917).
Shift work is an employment practice designed to make use of the 24 hours of the clock, rather than a standard working day .
The term shift work includes both long-term night shifts and work schedules in which employees change or rotate shifts.
[1] [2]
Twelve-hour work shifts are also in use.
In a modern steelworks, four sets of personnel are used, working consecutive days in one twelve hour shift (6:00 a.m.–6:00 p.m. and vice-versa).
Shift A will work days, and shift B nights, over a 48-hour period, before handing over to shifts C and D and taking 48 hours off.
In the offshore petroleum industry, employees may work 14 consecutive days or nights, 6:00 a.m.–6:00 p.m. or 6:00 p.m.–6:00 a.m., followed by three or four weeks free.
The svingskift (literally: swing shift) in the offshore petroleum industry in Norway refers to a two-week tour during which employees work 12-hour days the first seven days and 12-hour nights the second (or vice versa).
Shift work was once characteristic primarily of the manufacturing industry , where it has a clear effect of increasing the use that can be made of capital equipment and allows for up to three times the production compared to just a day shift.
It contrasts with the use of overtime to increase production at the margin.
Both approaches incur higher wage costs.
In general, requiring workers to live on a time-shifted schedule for extended periods is unpopular, and this typically must be paid for at a premium.
It is common in heavy industry, particularly automobile and textile manufacturing and is becoming more common in locations where a shut-down of equipment would incur an extensive restart process.
Food manufacturing plants, in particular, have extensive cleaning programs that are required before any restart.
The use of shift work in manufacturing varies greatly from country to country.
Shift work has been traditional in law enforcement and the armed forces : for example sailors must be available to handle a vessel around the clock, and a system of naval watches organized to ensure enough hands are on duty at any time.
This is shift work by another name.
Service industries now increasingly operate on some shift system; for example a restaurant or convenience store will normally each day be open for much longer than a working day.
Shift work is also the norm in governmental and private employment in fields related to public safety and healthcare , such as police, fire prevention, security, emergency medical transportation and hospitals .
Companies working in the field of meteorology , such as the National Weather Service and private forecasting companies, also utilize shift work, as constant monitoring of the weather is necessary.
Much of the Internet services industry relies on shift work to maintain worldwide operations and uptime .
The "Seven Day Eight Hour Rotating Shift" provides 24/7 coverage using 8 hour shifts with 14 crews.
Consisted of a Morning shift from 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., a swing shift from 3:00 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. and a night shift from 10:30 p.m. to 7:30 a.m. Each shift was worked for Five days straight.
The eight hour shifts allowed vacations and absences to be covered by splitting shifts or working double shifts.
The run of day shifts was 56 hours but the eight hour shift provided time for some socializing after work.
Was once common in the pulp and paper industry in the Western United States but has been largely replaced by a 8 days, 8 swing, 5 nights, 9 off, 8 hour rotation.
In many departments, firefighters work 24-hour shifts.
They are authorized to sleep in the fire station at night but are still subject to calls for service the entire shift.
Departments have many options for scheduling firefighters for coverage.
One option is 24 on/48 off, where a firefighter will work 24 hours and have 48 hours off, regardless of the day of the week or the holidays.
Often they will be scheduled in an A-B-C pattern.
Thus, a firefighter will be assigned to A, B or C shift and work whenever that letter is on the calendar.
Graveyard shift, night shift or third shift (3rd shift) means a shift of work running through the early hours of the morning, especially shifts from midnight until 8:00 a.m. or from 11:00 p.m. until 7:00 a.m. There is no certainty as to the origin of this phrase; according to Michael Quinion it is little more than "an evocative term for the night shift ... when ... your skin is clammy, there's sand behind your eyeballs, and the world is creepily silent, like the graveyard.
" [3]
The February 15, 2005 issue of American Family Physician noted that shift work has been associated with cluster headaches .
Health problems in the short term can also include fatigue, stress and loss of concentration, a higher rate of absence from the job and poor sexual performance, as shown in the majority of 200 variable-shift workers in a recent study in Kuwait.
[6]
In 1978 Cohen et al.
proposed that reduced production of the hormone melatonin might increase the risk of breast cancer, citing "environmental lighting" as a possible causal factor.
[7] Working the night shift first became associated with higher rates of cancer in 1987.
This may be due to alterations in circadian rhythm: melatonin, a known tumor suppressant, is generally produced at night and late shifts may disrupt its production.
Multiple studies have documented a link between night shift work and the increased incidence of breast cancer.
[8] [9] [10] [11]
The health consequences of shift work may depend on whether one is a day person or a night person and what shift one is assigned to.
These practices and policies can be fairly obvious: selecting an appropriate shift schedule or rota , setting the length of shifts, managing overtime, increasing lighting levels, or providing shift worker lifestyle training to help shift workers better handle issues such as understanding basic circadian physiology, sleep and napping, caffeine usage, social life issues, diet and nutrition, etc.
They may also be more indirect: retirement compensation based on salary in the last few years of employment (which can encourage excessive overtime among older workers who may be less able to obtain adequate sleep), or screening and hiring of new shift workers that assesses adaptability to a shift work schedule.

The industrial revolution made it possible for a larger segment of the population to work year-round, since this labor was not tied to the season and artificial lighting made it possible to work longer each day.
Peasants and farm laborers moved from rural areas to the factories , and work times during a year has been significantly higher since then.
[4] Before collective bargaining and worker protection laws , there was a financial incentive for a company to maximize the return on expensive machinery by having long hours.
Records indicate that work schedules as arduous as twelve to sixteen hours per day, six to seven days per week were practiced in some industrial sites.
Over the 20th century, work hours declined by almost half, mostly because of rising wages brought about by a renewed economic growth, with a supporting role from trade unions and collective bargaining , and progressive legislation.
The workweek, in most of the industrialized world, dropped steadily, to about forty hours after World War II .
The decline has continued at a faster pace in Europe: for example, France adopted a 35-hour workweek in 2000 , but North America has not.
In 1995, China adopted a 40-hour week, eliminating half-day work on Saturdays.
Working hours in industrializing economies like South Korea , though still much higher than the leading industrial countries, are also declining steadily.
Work hours in Japan are decreasing, but many Japanese still work long hours.
Recently, Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) has issued a draft report recommending major changes to regulations that govern working hours.
The centerpiece of the proposal is an exemption from overtime pay for white-collar workers.
Law in Mexico provides for a maximum of 48 hours of work a week.
However, due to loopholes in the law, the precariousness of labor rights in Mexico and its underdevelopment in relation to other OECD member nations, this is rarely observed in the private sector, with workers more often than not working overtime without getting any due compensation for it.
Fear of the employees' losing their job or threats by the employer partly explains the reason for these irregularities.
Beginning in 1950, under the Truman Administration, and continuing with all administrations since, the United States became the first known industrialized nation to explicitly (albeit secretly) and permanently forswear a reduction of working time.
Given the military-industrial requirements of the Cold War, the authors of the then secret National Security Council Document 68 [15] proposed the US government undertake a massive permanent national economic expansion that would let it “siphon off” a part of the economic activity produced to support an ongoing military buildup to contain the Soviet Union :
Under most circumstances, wage earners and lower-level employees may be legally required by an employer to work more than forty hours in a week; however, they are paid extra for the additional work.
Many salaried workers and commission-paid sales staff are not covered by overtime laws.
These are generally called "exempt" positions, because they are exempt from federal and state laws that mandate extra pay for extra time worked.
[26] The rules are complex, but generally exempt workers are executives, professionals, or sales staff.
[27] For example, school teachers are not paid extra for working extra hours.
Business owners and independent contractors are considered self-employed, and none of these laws apply to them.
In some states, firms are required to pay double-time, or twice the base rate, for each hour of work past 60, or each hour of work past 12 in one day in California.
[28] This provides an incentive for companies to limit working time, but makes these additional hours more desirable for the worker.
It is not uncommon for overtime hours to be accepted voluntarily by wage-earning workers.
Unions often treat overtime as a desirable commodity when negotiating how these opportunities shall be partitioned among union members.
In India at the managerial level, particularly in smaller Indian companies, a person generally works for 11 hours a day and 6 days a week.
A typical office will open at 09:00 or 09:30 and officially end the work day at about 19:00.
However, many workers and especially managers will stay later in the office due to additional work load.
However, large Indian companies and MNC offices located in India tend to follow a 5-day, 8-9h-hour per day working schedule.
The Government of India in some of its offices also follows a 5-day week schedule.
In the United States, the distinction between periodic salaries (which are normally paid regardless of hours worked) and hourly wages (meeting a minimum wage test and providing for overtime ) was first codified by the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.
At that time, five categories were identified as being "exempt" from minimum wage and overtime protections, and therefore salariable.
In 1991, some computer workers were added as a sixth category but effective August 23, 2004 the categories were revised and reduced back down to five (Executive, Administrative, Professional, Computer, and Outside Sales Employees).
Salary is generally set on a yearly basis.
"The FLSA requires that most employees in the United States be paid at least the federal minimum wage for all hours worked and overtime pay at time and one-half the regular rate of pay for all hours worked over 40 hours in a workweek.
However, Section 13(a)(1) of the FLSA provides an exemption from both minimum wage and overtime pay for employees employed as bona fide executive, administrative, professional and outside sales employees.
Section 13(a)(1) and Section 13(a)(17) also exempt certain computer employees.
To qualify for exemption, employees generally must meet certain tests regarding their job duties and be paid on a salary basis at not less than $455 per week.
" DOL's FairPay Overtime Initiative
Of these five categories only Computer Employees has an hourly wage-based exemption ($27.63 per hour) while Outside Sales Employee is the only main category not to have the minimum salary ($455 per week) test though some sub categories under Professional (like teachers and practitioners of law or medicine) also do not have the minimum salary test.
A general rule for comparing periodic salaries to hourly wages is based on a standard 40 hour work week with 50 weeks per year (minus two weeks for vacation).
(Example: $40,000/year periodic salary divided by 50 weeks equals $800/week.
Divide $800/week by 40 standard hours equals $20/hour).
Real median household income in the United States climbed 1.3 percent between 2006 and 2007, reaching $50,233 according to a report released by the U.S. census bureau.
This is the third annual increase in real median household income.
Unpaid leave for children under 8.
For unpaid leave you have to have worked for an employer for over 1 year.
The government gives all parents that use unpaid parental leave, through tax breaks, 50% of the national minimum wage.
Employers have the possibility to provide a payment on their own discretion.
Payment for parental leave can also be set at the collective labour agreements.
The mother can also take an extra full year of unpaid leave after the paid period ends.
The father can also take an extra full year of unpaid leave after the paid period ends.
In addition, the father is entitled to take two weeks unpaid leave directly before or after birth (many fathers are paid for these weeks by their employers).

The term "occupational disease" refers to those illnesses caused by exposures at the workplace.
They should be separated, conceptually, from injuries that may also may occur at workplaces due to a variety of hazards.
Occupational diseases may occur in varying time frames, from the instantaneous development of illness following exposure to toxic chemicals to decades between onset of exposure and the development of disease, as occurs with many occupationally related cancers.
Many time frames in between these extremes may be seen as well.
Examples of varying time frames include instantaneous reactions to exposure to chemicals such as chlorine or ammonia gas; a delay of some six to twelve hours with fumes of aerosolized zinc, as occurs when welding on galvanized steel; a delay of weeks to months with lead poisoning; a delay of decades with occupational carcinogens; and even the finding of congenital malformations in children whose parents may have been exposed to hazardous materials.
Although not all occupational exposures that cause illness lead to death, considerable numbers of deaths each year are associated with workplace exposures.
While it is relatively easy to count deaths due to occupational injuries, it is much more difficult for delayed illnesses.
For injuries, the most recent available data indicates that more than 6,200 fatal occupational injuries occur in the United States each year, with more than 40 percent associated with transportation, and most of these related to motor-vehicle fatalities.
Homicides are the second leading cause of death in the workplace, accounting for some 14 percent of the total.
The leading causes of death from injuries vary by sex, with motor vehicles accounting for the greatest number of deaths in men, and homicides in women.
Workers older than sixty-five have the highest rates of occupational-injury deaths.
Also, smaller workplaces (those with less than ten workers) have the highest fatality rate.
Many large companies invest in occupational safety and health programs and do ongoing workplace assessments.
Companies with strong programs are known to have lower injury rates.
Among the occupational diseases most commonly reported, those relating to repeated trauma, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, tendonitis, and noise–induced hearing loss, accounted for more than 60 percent.
Carpal tunnel syndrome alone accounted for almost 30,000 cases with days away from work.
For those cases of carpal tunnel syndrome with workplace absence, half needed twenty-five or more days away from work.
Skin diseases represented about 13 percent (58,000 cases) of work related illnesses.
Dermatitis, or inflammation of the skin, resulted in more than 6,500 cases that required time away from work.
There are insufficient numbers of occupational physicians properly trained to care for the hundreds of thousands of cases of occupational disease.
Only about 10,000 of some 800,000 American doctors practice in the field of occupational medicine, and only a small percentage of these have had training leading to certification as specialists in this field.
Most occupational diseases are treated by primary-care physicians, and, unfortunately, many of them have had little or no training in occupational disease.
There are two government agencies that have a special role in evaluating occupational disease.
The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has the responsibility for research and prevention activities with regards to workers' health.
NIOSH advises as to allowable levels of exposure, based upon scientific review.
Within the Department of Labor is the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), which has the responsibility of actually setting and enforcing workplace regulations.
One of the difficulties that OSHA faces is an insufficient number of inspectors to evaluate what actually goes on at most workplaces; given the number of inspectors in the United States at the present time, it would take more than two decades for all workplaces to be inspected even once.
OSHA's resources focus on fatalities.
In addition to government agencies, there are a variety of voluntary groups, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists and the National Safety Foundation, that make recommendations for safe and healthful practices in the workplace.
occupational disease, illness incurred because of the conditions or environment of employment.
Unlike with accidents, some time usually elapses between exposure to the cause and development of symptoms.
In some instances, symptoms may not become evident for 20 years or more.
Among the environmental causes of occupational disease are subjection to extremes of temperature (leading to heatstroke or frostbite), unusual dampness (causing diseases of the respiratory tract, skin, or muscles and joints) or changes in atmospheric pressure (causing decompression sickness , or the bends), excessive noise (see noise pollution ), and exposure to infrared or ultraviolet radiation or to radioactive substances.
The widespread use of X rays, radium, and materials essential to the production of nuclear power has led to an especial awareness of the dangers of radiation sickness ; careful checking of equipment and the proper protection of all personnel are now mandatory.
Recognition of the effects of working under deleterious conditions and with harmful substances has resulted in efforts to protect workers from exposure to them.
Legislation to prevent or limit the occurrence of occupational disease dates from the Factory Act in England in 1802.
Prevention of unhealthy or unsafe working conditions and oversight of healthy and safe workplaces are the responsibility in the United States of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Environmental Protection Agency , as well as many state agencies.
Many occupational abuses have been redressed by litigation and legislation in the United States, and workers' compensation takes care, by a system of insurance, of those who suffer from occupational diseases.
An individual suffering from an occupational disease can seek compensation for his or her condition under workers' compensation statutes or such federal legislation as the Black Lung Benefits Act of 1972, 30 U.S.C.A.
§ 901 et seq.
Worker's compensation statutes typically require that the worker contract the disease during the course of employment ; that the disease be peculiar to the worker's job by virtue of how it is caused and manifested or how job conditions result in a particular hazard, unlike employment in general; and that there be a substantially greater risk of contracting the disease or condition on the job in a different, more serious manner, than in general public experiences.
An occupational disease is any chronic ailment that occurs as a result of work or occupational activity.
It is an aspect of occupational safety and health .
An occupational disease is typically identified when it is shown that it is more prevalent in a given body of workers than in the general population, or in other worker populations.
Occupational hazards that are of a traumatic nature (such as falls by roofers) are not considered to be occupational diseases.
Donald Hunter in his classic history of occupational diseases discusses many example of occupational diseases.

The first written discussions specifically directed toward matters of occupational safety and health were those of Paracelsus, in the fifteenth century.
In the early eighteenth century, Bernadino Ramazzini wrote the first text on occupational medicine, De morbis artificium diatriba, and he is generally regarded as the "father of occupational medicine.
" Ramazzini wrote about the health hazards for dozens of occupations ranging from ditch diggers to tailors, from religious activities to those quite secular.
In the United States, in the early twentieth century, Dr. Alice Hamilton became the first woman physician appointed to a faculty position at Harvard University, where she worked at the School of Public Health promoting safe and healthful work practices in the United States.
She has been recognized as the leader of the occupational medicine movement in the United States, which came relatively late compared with that in Europe.
Until about 1970, there were few federal regulations in the United States with regard to workplace safety and health issues.
Each state had its own set of laws with regards to what were considered fair labor practices for workers, as well as a workers' compensation system for individuals that were injured.
There was state-by-state enforcement of such regulations.
In 1970, laws were passed establishing two government agencies: the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (USDHHS), which was mandated to undertake research and prevention activities related to work; and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) within the Department of Labor, which was mandated to set national standards for workplace safety and health and to enforce such standards.
Workers' compensation, however, has been left on a state-by-state basis, despite efforts toward federal standardization.
Compared with Europe, workers' compensation legislation came much later in America, and is more varied.
The oversight of occupational safety and health is delegated to OSHA, but other agencies regulate what can leave workplaces by way of emissions (the Environmental Protection Agency), or as products (the Food and Drug Administration or the Consumer Product Safety Commission).
NIOSH once maintained a list of the "top ten" issues considered the most serious in the area of occupational safety and health.
Included were occupational cancers, occupational lung disease, skin disorders, and similar problems.
In 1996 a major overhaul of this approach was undertaken, and currently the governing construct for research carried out by NIOSH is the National Occupational Research Agenda, or NORA.
Replacing the traditional top-ten list are twenty-one areas covering basic toxicology, human interactions in the workplace, emerging technologies, and psychological aspects of work in ways that are much more comprehensive than what had existed previously.
It also evaluates combinations of exposures in the workplace, since workers are rarely exposed only to one material at a time, and it includes issues such as workplace organization to see how this impacts on occupational safety and health.
As the term "occupational safety and health" implies, there are two aspects to this field.
One is the area of safety, which seeks to make workplaces safe for workers so that they do not suffer injuries.
Poorly designed or laid-out workplaces or equipment may pose a serious hazard to workers, and more than 400,000 injuries occur at work each year.
Separate from the concept of safety is that of occupational health, where the goal is to prevent the occurrence of illnesses among workers because of exposures at their place of work.
A variety of professionals specialize in issues of occupational safety.
For example, certified industrial hygienists are the most experienced at assessing workplaces and monitoring workers to see what kinds of exposures are actually taking place.
With regard to safety issues, certified safety professionals constitute a group well qualified to assess safety at workplaces and to put in place safety programs for workers.
Other occupational safety professionals include engineers who can make assessments in the workplace.
Along with industrial hygienists, they can address such issues as ventilation or other protective measures.
As noted above, these are specialists in the field of occupational medicine who are best equipped to recognize and deal with the medical aspects of these problems.
The specialty of occupational medicine requires college, medical school, and a minimum three-year period of specialized training.
Among the areas that an occupational disease specialist must study are toxicology, epidemiology, organization of the workplace, regulations that control workplace exposures, as well as the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of occupational problems.
Occupational diseases are illnesses that occur because of workplace exposures.
Each organ system can have its own set of problems due to a wide variety of exposures.

Since 1950, the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have shared a common definition of occupational health.
It was adopted by the Joint ILO/WHO Committee on Occupational Health at its first session in 1950 and revised at its twelfth session in 1995.
The definition reads: "Occupational health should aim at: the promotion and maintenance of the highest degree of physical, mental and social well-being of workers in all occupations; the prevention amongst workers of departures from health caused by their working conditions; the protection of workers in their employment from risks resulting from factors adverse to health; the placing and maintenance of the worker in an occupational environment adapted to his physiological and psychological capabilities; and, to summarize, the adaptation of work to man and of each man to his job.
"
‘The main influence on the Dutch law on the job of the safety professional is through the requirement on each employer to use the services of a certified working conditions service to advise them on health and safety’ (Hale, A et alia.
2004). A ‘certified service’ must employ sufficient numbers of four types of certified experts to cover the risks in the organisations which use the service:
Similar to the findings of the ENHSPO survey conducted in Australia, the Institute of Occupational Medicine found that in the UK, there is a need to put a greater emphasis on work-related illness (Anonymous.
2008. ‘Occupational Health’, Health and Safety News: In Brief, Vol 60, Iss.
3; UK.
pg. 6).
Its been shown that in Australia and the USA that a major responsibility of the OHS professional is to keep company directors and managers aware of the issues that they face in regards to Occupational Health and Safety principles and legislation.
However, in Europe, it has been shown that this is where they are lacking.
“Nearly half of senior managers and company directors do not have an up-to-date understanding of their health and safety-related duties and responsibilities.” (Paton, Nic.
2008. ‘Senior Managers Fail to Show Competence in Health and Safety’ Occupational Health, Vol.
60, Iss.

In the European Union , member states have enforcing authorities to ensure that the basic legal requirements relating to occupational health and safety are met.
In many EU countries, there is strong cooperation between employer and worker organisations (e.g.
Unions) to ensure good OSH performance as it is recognized this has benefits for both the worker (through maintenance of health) and the enterprise (through improved productivity and quality ).
In 1996 the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work was founded.
In the United States , the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 created both the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).
[3] OSHA, in the U.S. Department of Labor, is responsible for developing and enforcing workplace safety and health regulations.
NIOSH, in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is focused on research, information, education, and training in occupational safety and health.
[4]
OSHA have been regulating occupational safety and health since 1971.
Occupational safety and health regulation of a limited number of specifically defined industries was in place for several decades before that, and broad regulations by some individual states was in place for many years prior to the establishment of OSHA.
In Malaysia , the Department of Occupational Safety and Health (DOSH) under the Ministry of Human Resource is responsible to ensure that the safety, health and welfare of workers in both the public and private sector is upheld.
DOSH is responsible to enforce the Factory and Machinery Act 1969 and the Occupational Safety and Health Act 1994 .
In the People's Republic of China , the Ministry of Health is responsible for occupational disease prevention and the State Administration of Work Safety for safety issues at work.
On the provincial and municipal level, there are Health Supervisions for occupational health and local bureaus of Work Safety for safety.
The "Occupational Disease Control Act of PRC" came into force on May 1, 2002.
[5] and Work safety Act of PRC on November 1, 2002.
[6] The Occupational Disease Control Act is under revising.
The prevention of occupational disease is still in its initial stage compared with industried countries such as the US or UK.
Modern occupational safety and health legislation usually demands that a risk assessment be carried out prior to making an intervention.
It should be kept in mind that risk management requires risk to be managed to a level which is as low as is reasonably practical.

Equal Pay Act (1963).
Legislation requiring equal pay for women was first introduced in 1945 in acknowledgment of women's war work.
Business owners and labor organizations succeeded in thwarting the effort, in part because of the perceived need for women to leave the labor force to create vacancies for returning servicemen.
By the end of the 1950s, policymakers were becoming concerned about insufficient use of "womanpower.
" Under the leadership of Esther Peterson, director of the Women's Bureau and an assistant secretary of labor in the administration of President John F. Kennedy, Congress in 1963 passed the Equal Pay Act as an amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to require employers to pay equal wages to men and women doing "equal work on jobs …which[require] equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and are performed under similar working conditions.
" The Equal Pay Act was the first federal effort to bar discrimination by private employers on the basis of gender.
Because the law was part of the Fair Labor Standards Act, wage and hour inspectors routinely reviewed company records and cited employers, rather than depending on complaints to alert them to violations.
During the next decade 171, 000 employees received $84 million in back pay.
In the 1970s, however, President Jimmy Carter's administration transferred enforcement to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which filed few Equal Pay Act cases.
Because women and men seldom possess identical job classifications, the reach of the Equal Pay Act has been limited.
Equal pay for women is an issue regarding pay inequality between men and women.
It is often introduced into domestic politics in many first world countries as an economic problem that needs governmental intervention via regulation .
The report commissioned by the International Trade Union Confederation in 2008 shows clearly that, based on their survey of 63 countries there is a significant gender pay gap; on average 15.6%, which means that `women earn on average 84.8% of men's earnings' [1] Women who are engaged in work in the informal economy have not been included in these figures.
Overall, throughout the world, the figures for the gender pay gap range from 13% to 23%.
This report argues that even when women are highly educated, that `higher education of women does not necessarily lead to a smaller pay gap; however, in some cases the gap actually increases with the level of education obtained' (Chubb, et al., 2008: 10).
The report also argues that this global gender pay gap is not due to lack of training or expertise on the part of women since ` the pay gap in the European Union member states increases with age, years of service and education( ibid).
Legislation passed by the Federal Government of the United States in 1963 made it illegal to pay men and women different wage rates for equal work on jobs that require equal skill , effort, and responsibility and are performed under similar working conditions.
Pay equality, or equal pay for equal work, refers to the requirement that men and women be paid the same if performing the same job in the same organization.
For example, a female electrician must be paid the same as a male electrician in the same organization.
Reasonable differences are permitted if due to seniority or merit.

Layoff (in UK [1] and US English), also called redundancy in the UK, is the temporary suspension or permanent termination of employment of an employee or (more commonly) a group of employees for business reasons, such as when certain positions are no longer necessary or when a business slow-down occurs.
Originally the term "layoff" referred exclusively to a temporary interruption in work, as when factory work cyclically falls off.
The term however nowadays usually means the permanent elimination of a position, requiring the addition of "temporary" to specify the original meaning.
Euphemisms are often used to "soften the blow" in the process of firing and being fired.
[8] The term "layoff" originally meant a temporary interruption in work (and usually pay).
The term became a euphemism for permanent termination of employment and now usually means that, requiring the addition of "temporary" to refer to the original meaning.
Many other euphemisms have been coined for "(permanent) layoff", including "downsizing", "excess reduction", "rightsizing", " delayering ", "smartsizing", "redeployment", "workforce reduction", "workforce optimization", "simplification", "force shaping", "recussion", and "reduction in force" (also called "RIF", especially in the government employment sector).
"Mass layoff" implies laying off a large number of workers.
"Attrition" implies that positions will be eliminated as workers quit or retire.
"Early retirement" means workers may quit now yet still remain eligible for their retirement benefits later.
While "redundancy" is a specific legal term in UK labour law , it may be perceived as obfuscation .
Firings imply misconduct or failure while layoffs imply economic forces beyond the employer's control.
VRIF - Voluntary reduction in force - The employee(s) did play a role in choosing to leave the company, most likely through resignation or retirement.
In some instances, a company may exert pressure on an employee to make this choice, perhaps by implying that a layoff or termination would otherwise be imminent, or by offering an attractive severance or early retirement package.

The question of retirement also affected the federal government.
The interest of Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft led to the creation of a series of commissions to investigate the manner in which a federal retirement policy might be implemented.
Due to opposition from the Woodrow Wilson administration, legislation enacting such a program was not passed by Congress until 1920.
Under this law, civil service employees could retire at age seventy , as long as they had a minimum of fifteen years of service.
Other employees, such as postal workers and clerks, could retire at sixty-five, and railway clerks at age sixty-two.
Retirement benefits were determined by the number of years the retiree had worked.
However, the law did not require mandatory retirement, and a person could work for as many as four years past his or her scheduled retirement date.
The law was amended in 1926 to provide greater benefits, as the original pension was inadequate to meet the needs of those who had retired.
Even with the concerns about financial security, retirement was becoming more of a social occurrence in the 1950s.
Private insurance companies began marketing programs designed to help people prepare for eventual retirement.
Postwar prosperity contributed to the growing idea that retirement could be a time of pleasure and creativity that was society's reward to those who toiled for a lifetime.
The growth of leisure industries, along with mass tourism and entertainment such as movies, television, golf, and many spectator sports, offered activities for the elderly at prices they could afford.
Mandatory retirement became less of an issue; as early as 1956, women could retire at age sixty-two, while men received that opportunity in 1962.
Reduced social security benefits accompanied early retirement in either case.
In general, retired Americans today have become a leisured class.
Continued technological advances have created products designed to satisfy increasingly narrow portions of the retirement market and offer more leisure-time choices.
Retirement communities, particularly in the Sun-belt, focus on the needs and interests of those residing in them.
Recreation and leisure costs have fallen as new and better products have been introduced.
Today's elderly, as a class, are also better able physically to partake of these options, and many leisure-time activities include various forms of exercise and sports.
Travel opportunities have also increased.
The tax-exempt status of retirement savings helps offer an incentive for retirement since it makes retirement income nearly the same as earning a salary, allowing the retired individual the maximum opportunity to take advantage of leisure-time activities that can replace the stimulus work satisfaction may have offered.
Even so, many senior citizens continue to work after retirement.
They do so either to supplement inadequate benefit packages, to help support other family members or to sustain a level of status they held before retiring and that their benefits do not allow them to maintain otherwise.
Retirement has also allowed the elderly to enhance their political power.
Political concerns of the elderly are promoted through senior citizens groups, of which AARP is the most prominent.
Other groups, such as the Alliance for Retired Persons, founded in 2001, also lobby on behalf of the nation's elderly.
Organizations such as these have been able to use their lobbying efforts successfully to protect social security, but have made little progress in regard to getting legislators to enact new programs for their benefit.
The cost of health care in retirement is large, because people tend to be ill more frequently in later life.
Most countries provide universal health insurance coverage for seniors, although in the United States many people retire before they become eligible for Medicare at age 65.
In 2006, Medicare Part D went into effect, expanding benefits to include prescription drug coverage.
Early retirement can be at any age, but is generally before the age (or tenure) needed for eligibility for support and funds from government or employer-provided sources.
Thus, early-retirees rely on their own savings and investments to be initially self-supporting, until they start receiving such external support.
Early retirement is also a euphemistic term for accepting termination of employment before retirement age as part of the employer's labor force rationalization.
In this case, a monetary inducement may be involved.
Those contemplating early retirement will want to know if they have enough to survive possible bear markets such as the one that sent the 1973 retiree back to work after 20 years.
social insurance designed to compensate workers for short-term, involuntary unemployment.
It was created primarily to provide financial assistance to laid-off workers during a period deemed long enough to allow them to find another job or to be rehired at their original job.
In most countries, workers who are permanently disabled or who have been unemployed for a long period of time are covered under other plans.
In countries such as Canada and Britain, workers in any occupation may qualify for unemployment insurance; the U.S. denies coverage to certain workers, such as government employees and the self-employed.
In most countries, benefits are related to earnings and are paid for a limited period of time.
Funding may come out of general government revenues or from specific taxes placed on employers or employees.
unemployment insurance, insurance against loss of wages during the time that an able-bodied worker is involuntarily unemployed.
The goal of such insurance is to provide a minimal livelihood to unemployed workers until they are once again employed.
Compulsory unemployment insurance makes such protection legally obligatory for certain classes of workers under prescribed conditions.
Voluntary unemployment insurance is maintained by private organizations sanctioned, encouraged, or subsidized by the state.
The first attempts to establish unemployment insurance plans began toward the end of the 19th cent.
in Germany, Italy, and Switzerland (see social security ).
Most Western European states adopted such plans in the early part of the 20th cent.
: France, 1905; Great Britain, 1911; the Netherlands, 1916; Italy, 1919; and Germany, 1927.
In the United States an unemployment insurance program, along with other welfare programs, was introduced by the Social Security Act of 1935.
That act, amended many times, provides for a sliding scale of payroll taxes on industry.
For example, employers whose records show that their business experiences little unemployment receive lower rates.
The Employment and Training Administration in the U.S. Dept. of Labor is responsible for administering the law.
Over the years Congress has extended the program to many workers initially not covered.
By 1994 more than 96% of all workers were covered by unemployment insurance.
Each state has its own unemployment insurance law and operates its own program.
See D. Nelson, Unemployment Insurance: The American Experience, 1915-1935 (1969); W. Vroman, Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund Adequacy in the 1990s (1990).
Unemployment compensation for U.S. workers was established by the federal Social Security Act of 1935 (42 U.S.C.A.
§ 301 et seq.).
Unemployment insurance provides workers who have lost their job through no fault of their own with monetary payments for a given period of time or until they find a new job.
This compensation is designed to give an unemployed worker time to find a new job equivalent to the one lost without major financial distress.
Unemployment compensation is also justified as a way to provide the U.S. economy with consumer spending during an economic downturn.
An unemployed worker is not required to submit proof that he needs money or that he has no other means of support.
Anyone who qualifies has a right to collect benefits because payments are designed to replace part of the wages lost during temporary periods of unemployment.
Severance pay does not necessarily preclude payment of benefits, but some state laws treat it as earnings for the amount of time such payments cover and do not allow payment of unemployment compensation until that time has expired.
Accumulated vacation time, vacation pay, or a leave of absence also serve to postpone or prevent the payment of benefits.
In Australia , social security benefits, including unemployment benefits, are funded through the income tax system.
There is no compulsory national unemployment insurance fund, rather, benefits are provided for in the annual Federal Budget by the National Treasury and are administrated and distributed throughout the nation by Centrelink .
Benefit rates are indexed to the Consumer Price Index and are adjusted twice a year according to the amount of underlying inflation or deflation.
In Canada the system now known as Employment Insurance was formerly called Unemployment Insurance until 1996 when it was changed due to perceived negative connotations.
Canadian workers pay premiums of 1.73% of insured earnings in return for benefits if they lose their jobs.
Employers contribute 1.4 times the value of employee premiums.
Since 1990, there is no government contribution to this fund.
The amount a person receives and how long they can stay on EI varies with their previous salary, how long they were working, and the unemployment rate in their area.
The EI system is managed by Service Canada , a service delivery network reporting to the Minister of Human Resources and Social Development Canada .
An unemployment insurance program was first attempted in 1935 during the Great Depression by the government of R.B.
Bennett .
It was, however, ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of Canada as unemployment was judged to be an insurance matter falling under provincial responsibility.
After a constitutional amendment was agreed to by the provinces, a reference to "Unemployment Insurance" was added to the matters falling under federal authority under the Constitution Act, 1867 , and the first Canadian system was adopted in 1940.
Because of these problems Canada was the last major Western country to bring in an employment insurance system.
It was extended dramatically by Pierre Trudeau in 1971 making it much easier to get.
The system was sometimes called the 10/42, because one had to work for 10 weeks to get benefits for the other 42 weeks of the year.
It was also in 1971 that the UI program was first opened up to maternity and sickness benefits, for 15 weeks in each case.
In the Italian unemployment insurance system all the measures are income -related, and they have an average decommodification level.
The basis for entitlement is always employment , with more specific conditions for each case, and the provider is quite always the state.
An interesting feature worthy to be discussed is that the Italian system takes in consideration also the economic situation of the employers, and aims as well at relieving them from the costs of crisis.
Wisconsin originated the idea of unemployment insurance (UI) in the U.S. in 1932.
[17] In the United States , there are 50 state unemployment insurance programs plus one each in the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico .
Through the Social Security Act of 1935, the Federal Government of the United States effectively encouraged the individual states to adopt unemployment insurance plans.
To facilitate this program, the U.S. Congress passed the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), which authorizes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to collect an annual federal employer tax used to fund state workforce agencies.
FUTA covers the costs of administering the Unemployment Insurance and Job Service programs in all states.
In addition, FUTA pays one-half of the cost of extended unemployment benefits (during periods of high unemployment) and provides for a fund from which states may borrow, if necessary, to pay benefits.
As originally established, the states paid the federal government.
[18]
The FUTA tax rate was originally three percent of taxable wages collected from employers who employed at least four employees, [19] and employers could deduct up to 90 percent of the amount due if they paid taxes to a state to support a system of unemployment insurance which met Federal standards, [17] but the rules have changed as follows.
The FUTA tax rate is now 6.2 percent of taxable wages of employees who meet both the above and following criteria, [18] and the taxable wage base is the first $7,000 paid in wages to each employee during a calendar year [18] .
Employers who pay the state unemployment tax on a timely basis receive an offset credit of up to 5.4 percent regardless of the rate of tax they pay their state.
Therefore, the net FUTA tax rate is generally 0.8 percent (6.2 percent - 5.4 percent), for a maximum FUTA tax of $56.00 per employee, per year (.008 X $7,000 = $56.00).
State law determines individual state unemployment insurance tax rates.
[18] In the United States, unemployment insurance tax rates use experience rating .
[20]
The federal government lends money to the states for unemployment insurance when the states run short of funds.
In general, this can happen when the unemployment rate is high.
The need for loans can be exacerbated when a state cuts taxes and increases benefits.
All loans must be repaid with interest.
Because it is a joint federal/state program run by the states, taxing business for the benefit of labor, the politics of unemployment insurance are very complex.
The Unemployment Insurance (UI) program helps counter economic fluctuations.
When the economy grows, UI program revenue rises through increased tax revenues while UI program spending falls as fewer workers are unemployed.
The effect of collecting more taxes than are spent dampens demand in the economy.
[ citation needed ] This also creates a surplus of funds or a "cushion" of available funds for the UI program to draw upon during a recession.
In a recession, UI tax revenue falls and UI program spending rises as more workers lose their jobs and receive UI benefits.
The increased amount of UI payments to unemployed workers puts additional funds into the economy and dampens the effect of earnings losses.
[ citation needed ]
Americans out of work who do not qualify for unemployment insurance include part-time, temporary, and self-employed workers.
[24]
Each Thursday, the Department of Labor issues the Unemployment Insurance Weekly Claims Report.
[28] Its headline number is the seasonally adjusted estimate for the initial claims for unemployment for the previous week in the United States.
This statistic, because of its timeliness, is an important indicator of the health of the labor market, and more broadly, the vigor of the overall economy.
"Overstaffing" or "hidden unemployment", the practice in which businesses or entire economies employ workers who are not fully occupied---for example, workers currently not being used to produce goods or services due to legal or social restrictions or because the work is highly seasonal.
A related kind of underemployment refers to "involuntary part-time" workers.
These are workers who could (and would like to) be working for the standard work-week (typically full-time employment means 40 hours per week in the United States ) who can only find part-time work.
Underemployment is more prevalent during times of economic stagnation (during recessions or depressions ).
Obviously, during the Great Depression of the 1930s, many of those who were not unemployed were underemployed.
These kinds of underemployment arise because labor markets typically do not " clear " using wage adjustment .
Instead, there is non-wage rationing of jobs.
The third definition of "underemployment" describes a polar opposite phenomenon: to some economists , the term refers to "overstaffing" or "hidden unemployment," the practice of businesses or entire economies employing workers who are not fully occupied i.e.
who are currently not being used to produce goods or services (in other words, employees who are not economically productive , or underproductive, or economically inefficient ).
This may be because of legal or social restrictions on firing and lay-offs (e.g.
union rules requiring managers to make a case to fire a worker or spend time and money fighting the union) or because they are overhead workers, or because the work is highly seasonal (which is the case in accounting firms focusing on tax preparation, as well as agriculture ).
This kind of underemployment may exist for structural or cyclical reasons.
In many economies, some firms become insulated from fierce competitive pressures and grow inefficient , because they are awarded a government monopoly (e.g., telephone or electrical utilities) or due to a situation of abuse of market power (e.g., monopoly ).
As such, if they may employ more workers than necessary, they might not be getting the market signals that would pressure them to reduce their labour force, and they may end up carrying the resultant excess costs and depressed profits .
In some countries, labour laws or practices (e.g.
powerful unions ) may force employers to retain excess employees.
Other countries ( e.g.
Japan ) often have significant cultural influences (the relatively great importance attached to worker solidarity as opposed to shareholder rights) that result in a reluctance to shed labour in times of difficulty.
In Japan, there is a long-held tradition that if a worker commits to serve a company with long and loyal service, the company will, in return, keep the worker on the payroll even during economic downturns.
In centrally-planned economies , lay-offs were often not allowed, so that some state-run companies would have periods when they had more workers than they needed to complete their tasks.
In 1917, the Mexican Constitution was the first national constitution that constitutionally guaranteed the right to strike.
Another unconventional tactic is work-to-rule (also known as an Italian strike, in Italian Sciopero bianco), in which workers perform their tasks exactly as they are required to but no better.
For example, workers might follow all safety regulations in such a way that it impedes their productivity or they might refuse to work overtime .
Such strikes may in some cases be a form of "partial strike" or "slowdown".
During the development boom of the 1970s in Australia, the Green ban was developed by certain more socially conscious unions.
This is a form of strike action taken by a trade union or other organised labour group for environmentalist or conservationist purposes.
This developed from the black ban, strike action taken against a particular job or employer in order to protect the economic interests of the strikers.
In some " Marxist-Leninist " regimes, such as the former USSR or the People's Republic of China , striking is illegal and viewed as counter-revolutionary [ citation needed ].
Since the government in such systems claims to represent the working class, it has been argued that unions and strikes were not necessary.
In 1976, China signed the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights , which guaranteed the right to unions and striking, but Chinese officials declared that they had no interest in allowing these liberties.
[7] (In June 2008, however, the municipal government in Shenzhen in southern China introduced draft labour regulations, which labour rights advocacy groups say would, if implemented, virtually restore Chinese workers' right to strike.
[8] ).
Trade unions in the Soviet Union served in part as a means to educate workers about the country's economic system.
Lenin referred to trade unions as "Schools of Communism.
"
This law also makes it easier for the employers to organise the production as it may use its human ressources more effectively, knowing beforehand who is going to be at work and not, thus undermining, albeit not that much, the effects of the strike.
Another counter to a strike is a lockout , the form of work stoppage in which an employer refuses to allow employees to work.
Two of the three employers involved in the Caravan park grocery workers strike of 2003-2004 locked out their employees in response to a strike against the third member of the employer bargaining group.
Lockouts are, with certain exceptions, lawful under United States labor law .
Act enacted in 1938 that applies to workers involved in interstate commerce.
It sets standards with respect to working conditions, including such aspects as minimum wage and working hours.
It has been periodically amended and adjusted to keep the standards relevant to the current working environment.
During the Great Depression, many employees with little bargaining power were subjected to onerous conditions of employment and inadequate pay.
In June 1938, Congress passed a bill designed to limit the maximum number of hours that could be required of employees and the minimum wages they could be paid.
This legislation, known as the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), or the Wages and Hours Act, was the last major piece of New Deal legislation.
In general, the FLSA , administered by the U.S. Department of Labor, set minimum wages and maximum hours for all employees manufacturing products that were shipped in interstate commerce.
It also established requirements for overtime and restricted child labor.
Originally, the act's provisions extended to approximately one-fifth of the working population.
Over the years, Congress amended the FLSA to add categories of employees to its coverage and to raise the level of the minimum wage.
Effective 1 September 1997, the minimum wage became $5.15 an hour.
Congress also passed legislation that covers the federal government as both an employer and a purchaser of goods and services.
The Davis-Bacon Act of 1931 requires that the federal government pay preestablished minimum wages to its employees, and the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act of 1936 requires that parties holding government contracts do the same.
In 1963, Congress passed the Federal Equal Pay Act, which provides that men and women must receive equal pay for equal work in any industry engaged in interstate commerce.
Fair Labor Standards Act or Wages and Hours Act, passed by the U.S. Congress in 1938 to establish minimum living standards for workers engaged directly or indirectly in interstate commerce, including those involved in production of goods bound for such commerce.
A major provision of the act was establishment of a minimum wage , initially $0.25 an hour, along with a maximum workweek of 44 hours; these were to become to become $0.40 an hour and 40 hours after seven years.
Other provisions set standards for overtime compensation and banned products of child labor from interstate commerce.
A Wage and Hour Division was created in the Dept.
of Labor, headed by an administrator empowered to accelerate the raising of standards within an industry if a committee representing the public as well as employers and labor recommended change.
Classes of workers initially exempt from the act included agricultural and seasonal laborers, handlers of perishable foods, and workers in certain industries covered by collective bargaining.
The Fair Labor Standards Act has been amended repeatedly in subsequent decades, with changes expanding the classes of workers covered; raising the minimum wage; redefining regular-time work and raising overtime payments so as to encourage the hiring of new workers, as opposed to the loading of extra work on the lowest-paid; and equalizing pay scales for men and women.
The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C.A.
§ 201 et seq.
), popularly known as the "Wages and Hours Law," was one of a number of statutes making up the New Deal program of the presidential administration of Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
Aside from setting a maximum number of hours that a person could work for the minimum wage, it also established the right of the eligible worker to "time and a half" or one and one-half times the customary pay for those hours worked in excess of the statutory maximum.
Over the years the Fair Labor Standards Act has been amended repeatedly.
Changes have included raising the minimum wage, expanding the classes of workers covered, redefining regular-time work and raising over-time payments so as to encourage the hiring of new workers, and equalizing pay scales for men and women.
Amendments have also provided more effective enforcement.
Amendments in 1966 extended the Act to workers in the retail and service industry, farm workers, government and transit employees, and restaurant, hotel, and domestic workers.
Some job categories had a lower minimum wage, and it was not until 1978 that all employees covered by the act earned the same rate.
In 1997 a sub-minimum wage of $4.25 was established for employees under the age of twenty for their first ninety days of employment.
At the same time the minimum wage was raised to $5.15.
States can set a wage higher than the federal minimum, and upwards of a dozen have.
The Fair Labor Standards Act has been called "the most vital social legislation" in American history because it affects every worker in interstate commerce.
Since its principal goal was to increase the purchasing power of the lowest-paid workers, it has also been called the original anti-poverty law.
Another byproduct has been to help society maintain a healthy balance between work and the rest of life.
The act's impact has eroded somewhat as more Americans have moved into professional and other employment categories, such as executive and administrative, that are exempt from wage regulations.
It does not cover approximately 50 million of the current 150 million workers.
In 2003 strong union opposition in the House of Representatives doomed the passage of the Family Time Flexibility Act, which would have allowed employees the option of receiving overtime pay in the form of time off.
This typifies continual attempts to change aspects of the law, but the Fair Labor Standards Act remains a major part of the American economic landscape.
The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 [1] (abbreviated as FLSA; also referred to as the Wages and Hours Bill [2] ) is a United States federal law .
It applies to employees engaged in interstate commerce or employed by an enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce [3] , unless the employer can claim an exemption from coverage.
The FLSA established a national minimum wage , [4] guaranteed ' time-and-a-half ' for overtime in certain jobs, [5] and prohibited most employment of minors in "oppressive child labor," a term that is defined in the statute.
[6]
The full effect of the FLSA of 1938 was postponed by the wartime inflation of the 1940s, which lowered wage values to below the level specified in the Act.
The October 26, 1949 Fair Labor Standards Amendment (ch.
736, Pub.L.
81-393, 63 Stat.
910, 29 U.S.C.
§ 201 ) included changes to overtime compensation, defined a "regular rate," redefined the term "produced," raised the minimum wage from 40 cents to 75 cents per hour and extended child labor coverage.
It also included a few new exemptions for special worker classes.
The Equal Pay Act of 1963 was passed to amend the FLSA and make it illegal to pay workers lower wages strictly on the basis on their sex.
It is often summed up with the phrase “Equal pay for equal work”.
This was a major step towards closing the wage gap in women's pay.
In the past, it had been generally accepted that women did not deserve to earn as much money as men because they were not heads of households.
However, in many homes, women were in fact the sole breadwinner for various reasons, ranging from death or disability of a spouse to divorce or single parenthood.
Regardless of roles in the family, the Equal Pay Act established a single standard to apply to both sexes.
The Equal Pay Act allows for unequal pay for equal work only when wages are set pursuant to a seniority system, a merit system, a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production, or other factors outside of sex.
The 1977 FLSA Amendment increased the minimum wage in yearly increments through 1981 to $3.35 an hour.
Changes were made involving tipped employees and the tip credit.
Partial overtime exemption was repealed in stages for certain hotel, motel and restaurant employees.
The Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (MSPA), passed in 1983 , was designed to provide migrant and seasonal farm workers with protections concerning pay, working conditions, and work-related conditions, to require farm labor contractors to register with the U.S. Department of Labor, and to assure necessary protections for farm workers, agricultural associations, and agricultural employers.
The Amendment to the FLSA enacted in 1985 permitted state and local government employers to compensate their employees' overtime hours with paid time away from work (compensatory time or “comp time”) in lieu of overtime pay.
It also included modifications to ensure that true volunteer activities were not impeded or discouraged.
The Department of Defense Authorization Act of 1986 repealed the eight-hour daily overtime requirements on all federal contracts.
The 1996 FLSA Amendment increased the minimum wage to $5.15 an hour.
However, the Small Business Job Protection Act (PL 104-188), which provided the minimum-wage increase, also detached tipped employees from future minimum-wage increases [10] .
Prior to 1996, tipped employees received 50% of the prevailing minimum wage.
The tipped employee minimum wage was frozen, under federal law at least, at $2.13 per hour( 29 U.S.C.
§ 203 ).
State laws that grant higher hourly wages remain in force.
On August 23, 2004, controversial changes to the FLSA's overtime regulations went into effect, making substantial modifications to the definition of an "exempt" employee.
Low-level working supervisors throughout American industries were reclassified as “executives” and lost overtime rights.
These changes were sought by business interests and the Bush administration , which claimed that the laws needed clarification and that few workers would be affected.
The Bush administration called the new regulations "FairPay.
" But other organizations, such as the AFL-CIO , claimed the changes would make millions of additional workers ineligible to obtain relief under the FLSA for overtime pay.
Attempts in Congress to overturn the new regulations were unsuccessful.
Conversely, some low-level employees (particularly administrative-support staff) that had previously been classified as exempt were now reclassified as non-exempt.
Although such employees work in positions bearing titles previously used to determine exempt status (such as "executive assistant"), the 2004 amendment to the FLSA now requires that an exemption must be predicated upon actual job function and not job title.
Those employees with job titles that previously allowed exemption but whose job descriptions did not include managerial functions were now reclassified from exempt to non-exempt.
The Fair Labor Standards Act applies to "employees who are engaged in interstate commerce or in the production of goods for commerce, or who are employed by an enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce", [3] unless the employer can claim an exemption from coverage.
Generally, an employer who does at least $500,000 of business or gross sales in a year satisfies the commerce requirements of the FLSA, and therefore that employer's workers will be subject to the FLSA's protections if none of the other exemptions apply.
Several exemptions exist that relieve an employer from having to meet the statutory minimum wage, overtime, and record-keeping requirements.
The largest exceptions apply to the so-called " white collar " exemptions that are applicable to professional, administrative and executive employees.
Exemptions are narrowly construed; an employer must prove that the employees fit "plainly and unmistakeably" within the exemption's terms.
Presuming an employee is not exempt from overtime, there are many instances in which overtime is not paid properly, including when an employee is not paid for travel time between job sites, activities before their shift starts or after it ends, and activities to prepare for work that are central to work activities.
If an employee is entitled to overtime they must be paid one and a half times the employee's "regular rate of pay" for all hours worked over 40 in the same work week.
A. You are entitled to compensation at the rate of 66 2/3 percent of your average weekly wage based on the four quarters prior to your injury, but no more than the maximum average weekly wage determined each year by the South Carolina Employment Security Commission.
If you were working two or more jobs at the time of accident, those wages may be included as part of the average weekly wage and compensation rate.
For example, if we assume that you have an average weekly wage of $450, you will be paid at a weekly compensation rate of $300(66 2/3% x $450 = $300).
Q. Can I receive workers’ compensation benefits if I suffer an occupational disease?
A. In South Carolina, the disability or death of an employee resulting from an occupational disease is treated as an injury by accident, and the employee, or in the case of death, the deceased’s dependents, may be entitled to compensation.
A disease may be recognized as an occupational disease only if it is caused by a hazard recognized as peculiar to a particular trade, process, occupation, or employment as a direct result of continuous exposure to normal working conditions.
In addition to occupational diseases, injury from harmful exposures to ionizing radiation is also defined for particular attention under the Workers’ Compensation Act.
Some examples of occupational diseases are byssinosis suffered by cotton mill workers, silocosis suffered by granite workers, and asbestosis suffered by construction workers in certain fields, maintenance workers, and shipyard workers.
A. It is illegal in South Carolina for your employer to terminate you in retaliation for filing a workers’ compensation claim.
You can be fired, however, if you are injured while violating a specific company policy (i.e., not wearing safety equipment, intoxication, etc.
) or if your doctor releases you to return to work with permanent restrictions that prevent you from meeting established employer work standards necessary to perform your job.
For example, if your job description requires you to be able to lift 70 pounds and your physician places you on permanent restrictions which prevent you from lifting more than 30 pounds, you can be fired for not being to meet established employer work standards.
In order to be eligible to make a claim for unfair dismissal, the employee has to meet certain requirements.
The employee must work part time or full time, although the actual number of hours worked each week is not relevant.
The employment must have been continuous for at least one year, except where the employee has been dismissed over certain issues, including:
a trade union issue, such as refusing to join a union or joining a union;
where the dismissal relates to sex, age, race or disability discrimination (in which case they should consider making a discrimination claim, rather than an unfair dismissal claim);
If you are considering making a claim for unfair dismissal, it is important to take action without delay.
Employees only have three months within which to make a claim.
You should always bear in mind that your solicitor will in most instances need to take some time to prepare the claim, so you shouldn’t wait until the three months is nearly up before seeking legal advice.
Employees who are dismissed when they reach the normal retirement age for their type of job cannot bring a claim for unfair dismissal.
This is always at least 65, but cannot be lower than this.
There are, however, exceptions to this, such as the employee being dismissed for belonging to a trade union despite he or she having reached the age of 65.
If an employee becomes so fed up with their employer’s behaviour that they decide to leave their job, they may have a claim for constructive dismissal.
These situations can be very difficult for an employee, and include making the employee’s working conditions so difficult that they are forced to leave their job.
Typical examples include:
49.1 Seniority.
Layoff seniority is defined as the continuous length of service in calendar days with the University from the most recent date of hire.
Service of less than full time shall be considered full time.
Time spent on leave of absence without pay or on layoff shall not be included in computing seniority except for cyclic year positions, but does not constitute a break in service.
Permanent employees who are veterans or their unmarried widows/widowers shall have added to their seniority the veteran's active military service to a maximum of five (5) years credit.
Probationary employees are not vested with seniority credits until successfully completing the probationary period.
Seniority shall be lost following a break in service including resignation, termination for cause, failure to return from a leave of absence, expiration of rehire rights.
Employees who enter into the bargaining unit from other state agencies and institutions of higher education shall earn layoff seniority from the first day of coverage under this Agreement.
Seniority for leave accrual purposes shall include all time credited to the employee up to the date of entering into the bargaining unit.
Unused sick and vacation leave balances of permanent status employees changing employment between bargaining unit and non-bargaining unit positions shall move with the employee.
(b) Employment Option.
The employee affected by the reduction in force shall be provided the opportunity to replace the most junior employee within the layoff/seniority unit (set forth in Appendix II ) in an FTE status within .2 FTE of the FTE status of the person in the position being abolished (e.g.
.8 FTE position being abolished incumbent eligible to replace individual in a .6-1.0 FTE position) and in the same classification as the individual(s) whose position(s) is being abolished and if the individual whose position is being abolished possesses the essential skills (defined as the minimum qualifications listed in the job description for the classification and any specific position requirements or credentialing requirements) to perform the most junior employee's position.
If there is no opportunity for the person in the position being abolished to replace another employee within .2 FTE and within the layoff/seniority unit, the employee shall have a right to bump the most junior employee in a position with a lower FTE status than their own within the layoff/seniority unit.
In accordance with 49.2.b.
above, if the incumbent in a position to be abolished has an opportunity to replace the most junior employee within the layoff/seniority unit, the incumbent will be given up to three (3) working days to determine if he/she wants to replace the junior employee or be placed on the rehire list.
Vacant positions or those held by probationary employees within the layoff/seniority unit will be considered a more junior position.
The University will refer an employee from the designated rehire list(s) for any open positions in the bargaining unit for which the laid off employee possesses the essential skills.
Employees referred from the rehire list(s) who possess the essential skills needed for a vacant position will be offered the position prior to the University posting for competitive recruitment.
From among these employees, offers will be made in seniority order, most senior person first.
Job requests for positions for which there are employees on rehire list(s) may not be withdrawn solely to avoid hiring laid off employees.
(f) Rehire Trial Period.
Employees placed into vacant positions from the rehire list will serve a six (6) week rehire trial period.
During the rehire trial period either party may, at its sole discretion and without resort to the grievance procedure, initiate return to the rehire list.
Time spent in a rehire trial period will not count toward the twenty-four (24) month rehire list period.
The six (6) week rehire trial period will be adjusted to reflect any paid or unpaid leave taken during the period.
Where it can be shown that the right caliber of staff is not available locally, the government will grant work permits to employ foreign staff.
Semi-skilled labor is available from other countries in the Leeward and Windward Islands, and technical and professional staff may be employed from any country.
Obviously, the costs of retaining foreign staff are higher than those of employing comparable locals and thus it is in the interests of the government and employers to ensure that locals are trained to allow them to fill senior positions, where feasible.
Severance pay is applicable after one year of service and is calculated in accordance with the
Every person who is not a national of Montserrat must have a work, permit before taking up employment in the country.
Normally, a work permit will be issued for a specific period to a nonnational to fill a particular post and only when qualified nationals are unavailable.
New enterprises should include in their applications for concessions the rights to a certain number of work permits.
In other cases posts must be advertised in the local newspaper and radio station prior to the submission of an application for a work permit.
Advertisements should reflect faithfully the duties to be performed and the minimum qualifications and experience required.
This requirement is to ensure that suitable nationals are given an opportunity to fill the vacancy.
Before granting work permits to nonnationals the Immigration authorities consider the number of nonnational employees in the employ of the company at the time of application.
Economists distinguish between various overlapping types of and theories of unemployment, including cyclical or Keynesian unemployment , frictional unemployment , structural unemployment and classical unemployment .
[42] Some additional types of unemployment that are occasionally mentioned are seasonal unemployment, hardcore unemployment, and hidden unemployment.
The U.S. BLS measures six types of unemployment, U1-U6 .
To the extent that hidden unemployment exists, it implies that official unemployment statistics provide a poor guide to what unemployment rate coincides with "full employment".
Hidden, or covered, unemployment is the unemployment of potential workers that is not reflected in official unemployment statistics, due to the way the statistics are collected.
In many countries only those who have no work but are actively looking for work (and/or qualifying for social security benefits) are counted as unemployed.
Those who have given up looking for work (and sometimes those who are on Government "retraining" programmes) are not officially counted among the unemployed, even though they are not employed.
The same applies to those who have taken early retirement to avoid being laid off, but would prefer to be working.
The statistic also does not count the " underemployed " - those with part time or seasonal jobs who would rather have full time jobs.
In addition, those who are of working age but are currently in full-time education are usually not considered unemployed in government statistics.
Because of hidden unemployment, official statistics often underestimate unemployment rates.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics measures employment and unemployment (of those over 15 years of age) using two different labor force surveys [59] conducted by the United States Census Bureau (within the United States Department of Commerce ) and/or the Bureau of Labor Statistics (within the United States Department of Labor ) that gather employment statistics monthly.
The Current Population Survey (CPS), or "Household Survey", conducts a survey based on a sample of 60,000 households.
This Survey measures the unemployment rate based on the ILO definition.
[60] The Current Employment Statistics survey (CES), or "Payroll Survey", conducts a survey based on a sample of 160,000 businesses and government agencies that represent 400,000 individual employers.
[61] This survey measures only nonagricultural, nonsupervisory employment; thus, it does not calculate an unemployment rate, and it differs from the ILO unemployment rate definition.
These two sources have different classification criteria, and usually produce differing results.
Additional data are also available from the government, such as the unemployment insurance weekly claims report available from the Office of Workforce Security, within the U.S. Department of Labor Employment & Training Administration.
[62] The Bureau of Labor Statistics provides up-to-date numbers via a pdf linked here.
[63] The BLS also provides a readable concise current Employment Situation Summary, updated monthly.
[64]
Dr. M. Brenner conducted a study in 1979 on the "Influence of the Social Environment on Psychology.
" Brenner found that for every 10% increase in the number of unemployed there is an increase of 1.2% in total mortality, a 1.7% increase in cardiovascular disease , 1.3% more cirrhosis cases, 1.7% more suicides, 4.0% more arrests, and 0.8% more assaults reported to the police.
[79] A more recent study by Christopher Ruhm [80] on the effect of recessions on health found that several measures of health actually improve during recessions.
As for the impact of an economic downturn on crime, during the Great Depression the crime rate did not decrease.
Because unemployment insurance in the U.S. typically does not replace 50% of the income one received on the job (and one cannot receive it forever), the unemployed often end up tapping welfare programs such as Food Stamps or accumulating debt .
Some hold that many of the low-income jobs are not really a better option than unemployment with a welfare state (with its unemployment insurance benefits).
But since it is difficult or impossible to get unemployment insurance benefits without having worked in the past, these jobs and unemployment are more complementary than they are substitutes.
(These jobs are often held short-term, either by students or by those trying to gain experience; turnover in most low-paying jobs is high.
)
Many countries aid the unemployed through social welfare programs.
These unemployment benefits include unemployment insurance, unemployment compensation , welfare and subsidies to aid in retraining.
The main goal of these programs is to alleviate short-term hardships and, more importantly, to allow workers more time to search for a job.
In the U.S. the unemployment insurance allowance one receives is based solely on previous income (not time worked, family size, etc.
) and usually compensates for one-third of one's previous income.
To qualify, one must reside in their respective state for at least a year and, of course, work.
The system was established by the Social Security Act of 1935 .
While 90% of citizens are covered on paper, only 40% could actually receive benefits.
[ citation needed ] In cases of highly seasonal industries the system provides income to workers during the off seasons, thus encouraging them to stay attached to the industry.
Citizens of France, Germany, Austria, Italy, Spain, Portugal, United Kingdom, Ireland, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Greece, Cyprus, Malta, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein are not restricted as far as work permit quotas are concerned.
Citizens of Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovenia and Slovakia benefit from the agreement on the free movement of person agreement in Switzerland, but work permit quotas apply for the above mentionned nationalities.
Work permit quotas must end in 2011.
To work in Switzerland, a work permit is required.
There are several kinds of work permits: frontier workers, temporary or permanent worker.
The main work permits are the following:
The "L"work permit allows to undertake any paid activity anywhere in Switzerland.
The "L" work permit is valid for 3 months up to one year.
Citizens from Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania are subject to quotas.
The "B"work permit allows to undertake any paid activity anywhere in Switzerland.
The "B"work permit is valid for 5 years and may be extended.
Citizens from Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania are subject to quotas.
The "G"work permit allows to undertake any paid activity anywhere in Switzerland.
The foreign worker under a "G" work permit must be domiciled in an other EU or EEA member state.
The "G" work permit validity is variable in cases of temporary work contract, or of 5 years renewable in case of permanent work contract.
Foreign nationals from outside the EU/EEA are subject to strict quotas.
Requirements are sometimes hard to reach and the most qualified and graduated applicants are likely to get a work permit in Switzerland.
A temporary change in an employee’s work schedule that places the employee in a non-working, non-pay status for one or more complete pay periods and reduces scheduled work hours and pay during one or more other pay periods.
For example, the employee’s schedule may be changed to reflect no work hours from November 25 through January 9, and 32 hours per week from January 10 through March 10.
The maximum total reduction of work time for a full-time employee is 690 hours in a 365-day period.
A temporary change in an employee’s work schedule that places the employee in a non-working, non-pay status for one or more complete pay periods.
The employee’s work schedule is changed so that the (full-time) employee does not work for up to 690 work hours within a 365-day period.
Such non-working status may be scheduled continuously or intermittently within the 365-day period.
A temporary change in an employee’s work schedule so that the employee works fewer than his or her regularly scheduled work hours per pay period.
The employee’s salary is reduced commensu­rately for affected pay periods during the specified duration of the schedule reduction.
A reduction in hours may be scheduled continuously or intermittently.
The maximum reduc­tion is 690 hours in a 365-day period (for full-time employees).
A full-time, 40-hours per week employee’s work schedule may be reduced by no more than 690 hours per 365-day period.
The limit for part-time classified employees must be pro-rated according to their percentage of a 40-hour schedule.
An employee on STD under the Virginia Sickness and Disability Program (see Policy 4.57, Virginia Sickness and Disability Program ) may receive notice that his or her position will be subject to a TWFR.
STD benefits will not be reduced because of the TWFR status except that the employee may not use annual, compensa­tory or overtime leave to restore his or her salary to 100% income replacement.
However, disability credits may be used during TWFR to restore the employee’s salary to 100% income replacement.
An employee on LTD-Working status under the Virginia Sickness and Disability Program may receive notice that his or her position will be subject to a TWFR.
Benefits provided to employees will not be reduced because of TWFR status.
The employee may not use annual, compensatory or overtime leave to restore his or her salary to 100% income replacement but may use disability credits to receive 100% income replacement.
The agency will be responsible for payment for disability credits used.
Annual, compensatory or overtime leave, and family and personal leave may not be used to supplement salary to receive 100% income replacement for non-VSDP or VSDP employees receiving benefits.
Employees receiving VSDP benefits may use Disability Credits to restore their salary to 100%.
Reduced Hours – Employees in TWFR status who are working reduced hours on January 10 will receive the allotment of VSDP leave on January 10 for current part-time employees based on their months of state service.
When they return to a full-time work schedule, their allotment will be increased to the appropriate full-time amount.
(Used leave will not be replaced.
)
Annual, Traditional Sick, Compensatory, and Overtime Leave – Balances are retained.
Leave may be used as appropriate to cover absences from scheduled work time for employees working reduced hours.
1.
Chairman, thank you for this invitation to present the views of the ETUC on these two cases.
We are grateful that you have moved swiftly to deal with them.
They are of massive importance to the European trade union world, and not just to our colleagues directly affected in Sweden/Latvia and Finland/Estonia.
It is deeply ironic that the Swedish and Danish models – the widely respected home of flexicurity - are under particular pressure from these cases.
2.
They are different cases with different implications and the Viking case in particular has not yet finished its legal journey.
The consequences of the Laval case for the Swedish system are the subject of social partner negotiations in Sweden, and talks are also underway in Denmark which shares many similarities with Sweden.
But the cases have huge European importance to which I want to draw your attention.
3.
In effect, in the Laval case, the European Court of Justice, by accident or design, has come close to challenging the European Parliament’s compromise position on the Services Directive by ruling that the free movement of services can impede the exercise of trade union fundamental rights to demand equal treatment.
Collective action by unions to push for equal pay with host country workers could be regarded as an obstacle to free movement (although the ECJ recognised there could be an overriding public interest to avoid social dumping).
4.
In the Viking case, although there are positive features to this case, one worrying point in particular stands out.
The Court stressed that collective action must be “proportionate” to the issue in dispute and has indicated that the action of the International Transport Workers was not proportionate.
(This issue is now referred to a UK court if the case is not otherwise settled between the parties).
We are now left with not knowing what is “proportionate” action and what is not.
Presumably a court will define “proportionality” in the context of each case, so creating intolerable uncertainty for unions involved in virtually any case of industrial action over migration and free movement, a naturally growing area for disputes as Europe integrates its labour and services markets.
In some member states, the right to strike is a first rank constitutional right and this is now at risk.
So, generally, is trade union autonomy.
5.
The Laval case is unclear as to the question of when collective agreements set standards above minimum levels; are these standards recognisable by the ECJ as applicable standards?
A German case – the Rueffert case – will be important on this issue when the judgment is issued in mid March.
6.
So we are being told that the right to strike is a fundamental right but not so fundamental as the EU’s free movement provisions.
This is a licence for social dumping and for unions being prevented from taking action to improve matters.
Any company in a transnational dispute has the opportunity to use this judgement against union actions, alleging “disproportionality”.
9.
Firstly, quickly, we need a “Social Progress Clause” issued in anticipation of the EU Reform Treaty (article 5(a)), which firmly establishes that the Treaty and especially its fundamental freedoms shall be interpreted as respecting the observance of fundamental rights and especially collective action.
It should also establish the rights of workers and their representatives to take collective action to improve their working and living conditions above minimum standards.
(There is a precedent for this procedure with the Amsterdam Treaty to which the Employment Chapter was added at a late stage.
There are also precedents with the Monti clause and the Services Directive).
The sources of labour law are to be found in the Code of Obligations (CO) of 30 March 1911, as amended in July 2006, Part X of which is entitled “Contracts of Employment”, [1] and the federal Labour Act (LA) concerning work in industry, handicrafts and commerce of 13 March 1964, as amended by several ordinances.
In addition, labour law is governed by, among others, collective contracts of employment (CCE), which can be either national or cantonal.
According to Art.
320 of the CO, employment contracts do not require for their validity any special form.
However, when the duration of employment relationship is unlimited or of more than one month, the employer must inform by written the worker on specified work conditions (Art.
330b CO), such as the name of the parties, date of the beginning of the employment relationship, job description, salary conditions and weekly number of work hours.
The Swiss legislation on the termination of employment relationship applies in principle equally to the employer and the worker.
A contract concluded for an indefitite period can be terminated after a period of notice given by one of the parties or at any time, without prior notice, if one of the parties has a just cause to terminate it.
During the probationary period, either of the parties may terminate the employment relationship with a notice period of seven days; the first month of the employment relationship is deemed to be the probation period (Art.
335b(1), CO).
Various provisions can be agreed in writing, by standard contract or collective agreement, though the probationary period may not exceed three months (Art.
335b.2 CO).
In the event that a probation period is interrupted due to sickness, accident or the performance of a legal duty which is not voluntarily assumed, the probation period is prolonged correspondingly (Art.
335b(3), CO).
There is an abuse of rights if one of the parties terminates the employment contract (Art.
336. 1, CO):
Two types of termination of employment relationship are envisaged under Swiss law.
The employer may terminate the contract by ordinary dismissal or by means of dismissal with immediate effect.
Justification is not required in the Swiss legal system for an ordinary dismissal, as dismissal with notice is not linked to the existence of a valid reason.
The employer may at any time terminate the employment relationship without notice for valid reasons.
A valid reason is considered to be any circumstance under which the terminating party can in good faith not be expected to continue the employment relationship (Art.
337(1), (2) and (3), CO).
Upon expiry of the probation period, the employer may not terminate the employment relationship (Art.
336c(1), CO) during:
Collective dismissals are those made by the employer within a period of 30 days for reasons which are not related to the personality of the workers and affecting the following numbers of workers (sec.
335d, CO):
without respecting the consultation procedure prescribed for collective dismissals.
Upon the request of the other party, the party giving notice has to state the reason for terminating the employment contract (Art.
335, CO).
The ordinary period of dismissal notice varies according to length of service.
The notice period is of one month during the first year of service, two months for the employment lasting two to nine years, and three months for the employment whose duration exceeds nine years.
The timeframes envisaged under the law may be changed by written agreement, standard employment contract or collective agreement, but may not be less than one month.
Exceptions to this rule are admitted during the first year and if they have been set by a collective agreement (Art.
335c CO).
In the case of collective redundancies, the employer may terminate the employment contracts with a 30-day notice period (Art.
335d CO).
The employer is also required to consult the workers' representatives before proceeding to redundancies and allow them to formulate proposals on the means of averting collective dismissals or to limit the number of persons affected and minimize the consequences.
The employer must state in writing the reasons for dismissal, the number of workers affected, the number of workers regularly employed and the period in which the dismissals are to take place.
He or she must send a copy of this statement to the Cantonal Labour Office, which will try to find solutions to the problems posed by the collective dismissals.
The workers’ representatives may submit their observations (Art.
335f and g, CO).
Upon termination of the employment relationship of a worker of at least 50 years of age and with 20 or more years of service, the employer has to pay the worker a severance allowance, the amount of which may be fixed by written agreement, standard employment contract or collective employment contract, but it should not be less than an amount equal to the worker’s wages for two months (Arts.
339b and 339c, CO).
If the amount of the severance pay is not fixed, a judge may set it at his or her discretion, but it should not exceed the amount equal to the worker’s wages for eight months.
Severance pay may be reduced or eliminated if the employment relationship was terminated by the employee without a valid reason or by the employer with a valid reason.
Collective employment contracts may contain additional provisions in this regard.
The employer and worker may terminate an employment contract immediately and without notice, if there are good grounds for such immediate termination, especially in circumstances which, in keeping with the rules of good faith, render the continuation of the work relationship intolerable for said people (Art.
337 CO).
If termination with immediate effect is unjustified, it does nonetheless remain valid.
However, the party who terminates the contract with immediate effect without justifiable cause must indemnify the other party.
The party who improperly gives notice of termination of the employment relationship must pay the other party compensation in an amount to be determined by the presiding judge.
However, such compensation must not exceed an amount corresponding to the worker’s wages for six months.
Claims for damages based on other legal grounds are unaffected.
There are no provisions for reinstatement (Arts.
336a(1), (2) and (3), CO).
If the employer dismisses the worker without notice in the absence of a valid reason, the latter will have a claim for compensation of what he or she would have earned if the employment relationship had been terminated by observing the notice period or until the expiry of any applicable fixed-term period.
Offset against this compensation will be any amount the worker saved because of the termination of employment relationship, or any amount he or she earned from other work, or which he or she intentionally failed to earn.
The presiding judge may order the employer to pay an indemnity to the worker which the judge may determine at his or her discretion, taking into account all circumstances.
Such indemnity may not, however, exceed the worker’s wages for six months (Art.
337c, CO).
The employment relationship ends 30 days after the notification of collective dismissal to the Cantonal Labour Office.
Dismissal is considered abusive if the employer has not respected the consultation procedure prescribed for collective dismissals.
If this is the case, compensation corresponding to the employee’s wages for a period of up to two months will be due.
However, an applicable CCE may contain provisions for the payment of additional compensation (Arts.
336c(2) and 336a(3), CO).
There are no nationality restrictions for managers and company directors under Polish law.
As a rule, foreigners need to obtain a work permit to work legally in Poland.
However, citizens of the EU and some other countries, including Switzerland, Norway, Ireland and Lichtenstein, are exempt from this obligation.
Also, foreigners who are management board members do not need work permits as long as they do not stay in Poland for more than six months in any consecutive 12-month period.
To work in Poland foreigners generally need a work permit.
The following categories of foreign nationals are exempt from the obligation to obtain a work permit:
— Other foreigners released from the obligation to obtain a work permit under specific regulations.
Subject to the exceptions (see above, Required permits), before a foreigner can take up employment in Poland the prospective employer must obtain a work permit for that person.
Work permits are issued by the province governor (voivode, or wojewoda) competent for the employer’s registered office.
The province governor issues a work permit for a fixed term of no more than three years.
In the case of managers (management board members), a work permit can be issued for up to five years.
A work permit can be issued by the province governor if both:
A work permit is issued on the employer’s request, and is the basis on which a working visa is obtained by a foreign national intending to work in Poland from the Polish consulate or embassy in his place of residence.
The employment contract with the foreigner must strictly reflect the conditions in the work permit relating to employment duration, place of work and employee’s position.
According to information from the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy and the State Labor Inspectorate (where collective agreements are registered), about 20% of employees in Poland are covered by collective agreements.
There are very few collective agreements governing employment relationships in specific industries.
The minimum wage is set in Poland annually.
In 2010, it is PLN1,317 (about US$430).
It applies to all employees employed on a full-time basis (in the case of part-time employment, the minimum wage is calculated proportionally to the part-time employee’s working time).
However, remuneration in the first year of employment can be 80% of the minimum wage.
As a rule, overtime must not exceed 150 hours per employee in any calendar year.
However, a collective work agreement, work rules or, in the absence of these, an employment contract, can provide for a higher overtime limit.
However in this case, employees’ weekly working hours, including overtime, cannot exceed an average of 48 hours a week.
Childcare (unpaid) leave can be granted for a maximum period of three years until the child is four years old, to employees who have worked for at least six months.
Notice periods can only be shortened in special circumstances provided for in specific regulations (that is, in the event of the employer’s liquidation, bankruptcy, and termination of employment contract for reasons attributable to the employer).
Severance pay only has to be paid in the event of collective redundancies meeting the requirements provided for in the Act of 13 March 2003 on special rules for terminating employment for reasons not attributable to employees (Redundancies Act).
The amount depends on the employee’s employment record at a given employer and is:
The amount of severance pay cannot be more than 15 times the minimum wage.
Consequently, in 2010 severance pay cannot be more than PLN19,775 (about US$6,400).
— The intention to terminate the contract must be discussed with any trade union operating at the employer’s establishment and if the employee to be dismissed is a trade union member or his interests are protected by the trade union.
Employees dismissed for reasons not attributable to them are entitled to severance pay irrespective of the nature of the redundancy (collective or individual).
The Redundancies Act imposes the following obligations (additional to the general rules on terminating employment provided for in the Labor Code) on an employer carrying out collective redundancies:
— Notifying a trade union or, if there is no trade union, other employee representatives of the planned redundancies.
— Consulting the trade union or, if there is no trade union, other employee representatives over the planned redundancies.
— Concluding an agreement with the trade union within 20 days of the notification or, if an agreement cannot be
reached or there is no trade union, adopting redundancy rules.
— Developing a coherent overall policy to prevent accidents at work and occupational illnesses.
This policy should cover technology, work organization, working conditions, social relationships and the influence of factors related to the working environment.
— Ensuring that orders, requests, decisions and regulations of bodies supervising working conditions are executed.
There is no unified form of employee representation.
Employee representation is strongly developed in state enterprises where staff participates in management.
In private undertakings employees can be represented by trade unions, workers councils or employees elected by them to represent their interests.
Trade unions are also entitled to be informed or consulted in cases such as:
Certain consequences of asset deals that result in the automatic transfer of the work establishment or part of it require consultation with trade unions.
In share deals, consultations are generally not obligatory.
An employer’s failure to comply with consultation duties towards trade unions relating to the transfer of an undertaking or part of it exposes the employer to the risk of a fine or imprisonment.
The transfer of an undertaking or part of it cannot be the only or main reason for an employer terminating employment with notice.
However, both the old and the new employer can terminate the employment of employees affected by the transfer for other reasons or by applying employment termination methods in which there is no need to justify the termination (for example, by agreement of the parties).

Unlike the ordinary courts, the Industrial Court of Kenya is not mentioned in the Constitution, but was established in 1964 under the Trade Dispute Act (Cap.
234). The Industrial Court has found its current shape in 1971, when the Trade Dispute Act was amended in the light of the experience gained from 6 years of practical application.
The purpose of the Court is the settlement of trade disputes.
Vide the provisions of section 14, Trade Dispute Act (Cap.
234), the President of the Republic may establish the court, and determine the number of judges (not less than two).
Eight members are appointed by the Minister after consultation with the Central Organisation of Trade Unions (CETU) and the Federation of Kenyan Employers (FKE).
Whenever it appears to be expedient, each judge appoints two assessors, one to represent employees, from a panel of assessors appointed by the Minister, to assist in the determination of any trade dispute before the Court.
The jurisdiction of the Court is exercised by the judge and the two other members.
Only in the case that they are not able to agree, the matter will be decided by the judge “with the full powers of an umpire” (section 14 (8) Trade Dispute Act (Cap.
234)).
Applications for judicial review can be brought to challenge the procedural and substantive validity of the awards and decisions of the Industrial Court.
In effect this transfers the jurisdiction over labour law cases to the High Court.
The Trade Disputes Act does not exclude the right of litigants suing in open court.
On the contrary, section 14 (9) excludes trade disputes arising in the public sector from the jurisdiction of the Industrial court.
In addition access to the Court is limited by the rule of practice that only unions and employers and their organizations have standing before the Industrial Court; and as management staff is excluded from membership in trade unions, the Industrial Court does not deal with white-collar workers’ concerns.
Thus, a significant number of labour cases in the broader sense is being handled by ordinary courts, i.e.
the High Court, either from the first instance onwards, or – in a few cases - in appeal.
Within the ongoing general Labour Law Reform, a taskforce to review the Labour Laws has adopted a draft act on Labour Institutions, introducing a National Labour Court, having the same prerogatives as the High Court, on labour law issues.
(For more details, see the paragraph on the Labour Law Reform) .
Freedom of Association is guaranteed in the Constitution under Art.
80. This constitutional provision under Article 80 (2)(d) already regulates in detail procedures for the registration of trade unions and associations of trade unions.
Under this provision reasonable conditions relating to the requirements for entry on a register of trade unions include conditions as to the minimum number of persons necessary to constitute a trade union qualified for registration, or members necessary to constitute an association of trade unions qualified for registration.
Moreover, the Constitution already names conditions whereby registration may be refused by the registrar: “on the grounds that another trade union already registered or association of trade unions already registered, as the case may be, is sufficiently representative of the whole of a substantial proportion of the interests in respect of which registration of a trade union or association of trade unions is sought”.
The right to strike is not mentioned explicitly, but Art.
80 (1) protects not only the right to organize, but explicitly activities serving the purpose of the union, such as all activities designed to protect the individuals’ interests.
The Draft Constitution contains a Bill of Rights in its Chapter Six.
This Bill lays down the principle of equality (Section 35, 37), the freedom from discrimination (Section 36), the freedom from slavery and forced labour (Section 46) and the freedom of association (Section 52).
Section 59 on Labour relations determines the rights of workers, employers and trade unions, in particular the right to fair remuneration, the right to reasonable working conditions, the right to join a trade union or employer’s organization, the right to strike and the right to engage in collective bargaining.
The Evolution of Labour Law in Kenya
The genesis of labour law and practice can be traced to the 19th century when need arose for the colonial government to pass legislation to ensure adequate supply of cheap labour to service the emerging enterprises in agriculture, industry and in the service sector.
Terms and conditions of employment were regulated by statutes and the common law.
The law of contract in Kenya was originally based on the Contract Act, 1872, of India, which applied on contracts made or entered into before 1st of January 1961.
The Indian Contract Act applied to the three countries Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda .
Since then the Kenyan law of contract has been based on the English common law of contract, under the Kenyan Law of Contract Act (Cap.
23), section 2 (1).
With industrialization, towards the middle of the 20th century, an organized trade union movement was well established.
The first trade union regulation was made in the introduction of Ordinance No.
35 of 1939 that required all crafts organizations to apply for registration which they could be granted or denied depending on whether they had legitimate dealings consistent with government policy.
The Ordinance also permitted any group of seven people to form a trade union and operate as one upon registration.
Cancellation of registration under the Ordinance was not subject to appeal or open to question in a court of law (Aluchio 1998, 3).
In 1948, in order to gain complete hold on the wage earners organizations the government brought in a Trade Union Labour Officer, to be attached to the Labour Department with the duty to foster "responsible" unionism (Ananaba 1979, 3).
In 1952 a more detailed piece of legislation was enacted for Trade Unions but again with significant omissions.
It lacked necessary provisions for effective operation of trade unions.
It did not legalize peaceful picketing or provide immunity against damages as a result of strikes.
On the other hand, the government encouraged creation of staff associations and works committees since they fitted in its interests to confining workers’ organization to economic imperative alone and also lacked strike powers.
This rigid control of trade unions was maintained by the colonial government until the end.
This notwithstanding, the movement was able to grow both in numerical strength and power.
At independence the total number of following was about 155,000, 52 trade unions, with four centres formed and registered, namely, East African Trade Union Congress (EATUC), Kenya Federation of Registered Trade Unions (KFRTU), Kenya Federation of Labour (KFL) and Kenya Africa Workers Congress (KAWC).
Industrial confrontation arose not merely from traditional trade union activities, but also from the movement’s political role in the struggle for freedom from colonial domination, particularly after individual political leaders had been arrested and placed in detention.
On the threshold of independence however, both employers and trade unions, felt that it was vital for the infant nation to make economic process, that capital and labour should work together in harmony: the incidence of strikes and lockouts had to be drastically reduced.
As a result, in October 1962, a landmark was established with the signing of the Industrial Relations Charter by the government of Kenya, the Federation of Kenya Employers and the Kenya Federation of Labour, the forerunner of COTU (K), the Central Organisation Of Trade Unions (Kenya).
The Industrial Relations Charter has been revised twice since then, but remained the basis for social dialogue and labour relations in Kenya throughout the years.
Currently the “Charter” is under review again; the parties have already produced a draft Charter in 2001 that might be signed in the context of the overall Labour Law review.
In May 2001 a Taskforce to review the Labour Laws was appointed by the Attorney General (Gazette Notice No.
3204), within an International Labour Organisation project.
The terms of reference for the Taskforce were:
To examine and review all the labour laws including the Employment Act (Cap.226); the Regulation of Wages and Conditions of Employment Act (Cap.
229); the Trade Unions Act (Cap.
233), the Trade Disputes Act (Cap.
234), the Workmen’s Compensation Act (Cap.
236), the Factories Act (Cap.
514) and make recommendations for appropriate legislation to replace or amend any of the labour law statutes;
To make recommendations on proposals for reform or amendment of labour laws to ensure that they are consistent with the Conventions and Recommendations of the International Labour Organisation to which Kenya is a party; and
Review registration procedures and trade union monopoly based on the Trade Unions Act (Cap.
233) in view of the ratification of the ILO Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No.
87);
Setting up of an administration system which promotes involvement and democratic participation of the social partners (role of the Labour Advisory Board, possible involvement of civil society concerned in specific fields, etc.
);
Review the election procedures for trade union officials, and implement a system of directly elected workers’ representatives;
The tripartite Taskforce, comprising of members from the government, the trade unions (COTU) and the employers organization (FKE), officially handed over five new texts to the Attorney General in April 2004.
The five drafts, when they reach their final version, will replace the existing legislation on Labour Law.
These drafts relate to the following matters:
Draft on the Labour Relations Act: an act to deal with the registration, regulation, management and democratisation of trade unions and employers organizations or federations, to promote sound labour relations through the protection and promotion of freedom of association, the encouragement of effective collective bargaining and promotion of orderly and expeditious dispute settlement, conducive to social justice and economic development and related matters.
Draft on the Work Injury Benefits Act: an act to provide for compensation to employees for injuries suffered and occupational diseases contracted in the course of employment, for insurance of employees and related matters.
These texts do now have to follow the path towards adoption, which will hopefully be completed by the end of 2004.
Employment relations in Kenya are regulated by a number of sources: constitutional rights, as mentioned above; statutory rights, as set out in statutes and regulations; rights set by collective agreements and extension orders of collective agreements; and individual labour contracts.
Acts of Parliament in the realm of civil and criminal law, which have provisions that may have impact on individual and collective labour relations include the Contract Act, Local Government Act, Public Service Commission Act, the Children Act, laws concerning the Armed Forces, and legislation dealing with the establishment of parastatals.
The Employment Act (Cap.
226), and the regulation of Wages and Conditions of Employment Act (Cap.
229) make rules governing wages, housing, leave and rest, health and safety, the special position of juveniles and women and termination of employment.
The latter Act, in addition, sets up a process through which wages and conditions of employment can be regulated by the Minister.
An employment contract, which does not specify a fixed period of duration, is considered to be for an unlimited period of time, but can be terminated by notice of either party.
However, in the organized sector collective agreements which give workers tenure limit the employers’ ability to discharge and end the employment contract.
The draft Employment Act, handed over in April 2004 to the Attorney General by the Taskforce on the review of labour law, introduces significant changes concerning casual employment.
Employers who offer work that should last for at least one month should, if they cannot employ a worker on a permanent basis, engage him on a term contract.
Pursuant to this draft, a casual employee who is engaged for more than a month in a job which otherwise would not reasonably be completed in a period less than three months, shall now be treated as an employee on a fortnightly contract, and on termination should be paid a fortnight salary in lieu of notice.
Furthermore, where casual employees are employed for more than one month, they should, if the draft was adopted, be entitles to one paid rest day in a period of seven days.
Apprenticeship contracts that primarily intend to train young people in a profession are considered contracts of employment.
The apprentice therefore enjoys all the rights and suffers all the obligations of an employee, subject to the terms of the contract.
The only distinction between an apprentice and an employee is that the ‘full’ employment of an apprentice depends on his or her successful completion of the training.
Apprenticeships in the industrial sector are governed by the Industrial Training Act, which provides that the rules and principles governing the must be applied, unless the Act expressly states an exception, or when the application of labour law would not be compatible with the nature and aim of the vocational training being undertaken.
The minimum period of an apprenticeship contract under the Industrial Training Act, section 2, is four years of service.
Kenyan statutes do not relate to trial periods for individual labour contracts.
However, collective agreements generally establish a trial period, after which the worker receives tenure.
Trial periods range between 3 weeks (under the Regulation of Wages (Tailoring Garment Making and Associated Trades) Order) and 3 years (the latter in the civil service).
Government workers receive tenure according to the requirements set out in the Civil Servants Law (Appointments) and the Civil Service Rules, which are determined by the Civil Service Department of the Government.
Under the Trade Disputes Act the labour contract is suspended if a worker participates in a lawful strike or is affected by a lawful locked out.
Therefore, the employee does not violate his or her contractual obligations to his or her employer when he or she participates in a strike.
Likewise, lockouts do not terminate the employment relationship.
When the labour contract is suspended by worker participation in a strike, the employer is not required to pay wages, since no work has been performed.
Industrial Court judgements have held that an employer is not required to pay wages when the labour contract is suspended because of a strike.
This sub-section does not apply in cases when the contract itself, or a given collective agreement, requires a longer period of notice.
If an employer does not give notice, he or she should pay to the employee an amount equal to his or her wages for that period.
Collective agreements normally contain these rules too.
ii.
Rules of the Industrial Court: Unfair Dismissals
It has now been accepted that adherence to all the requirements of the law in giving notice is not enough.
Serious conflicts have been generated when an employee’s services have been terminated by the employer, on the grounds which appear to the general body of the work force to be spurious in order to get rid of the person.
Collective agreements regulate and limit the employers’ ability to discharge workers.
Grievance procedures and special dismissal procedures enable the union to represent the workers’ interest and negotiate the employers’ intent to make an individual or collective dismissal.
When agreement is not reached the dispute is often settled in arbitration.
Some collective agreements grant the employer the prerogative to dismiss a worker after the consultation and negotiation requirements have been met.
There are many rights that an employee may have by virtue of the contract, such as leave (annual, maternity, sick or study), allowances (leave, travelling, acting, duty or any other), medical and overtime payments, bonuses and many others.
They become relevant when the employment ceases.
Their equivalent in money will be calculated and paid to the employee as part of the termination rights.
In the understanding of the Industrial Court the basic principles that would apply in the event of redundancy were already laid down in the first version of the tripartite Industrial Relations Charter.
In addition, “redundancy” is defined under the Trade Disputes Act, section 2, as “loss of employment, occupation, job or career by involuntary means through no fault of an employee involving termination of employment ()”.
Moreover, redundancy and severance pay on redundancy are common features in collective agreements, defining the length of notice to be given to the union, and the notice period in respect of the employees to be declared redundant.
The individual employee is entitled to two basic rights, severance pay and payment in lieu of notice.
The rates of payment may depend on the agreement, but many range from fifteen to thirty days basic wage or salary for every completed year of service.
Following the jurisprudence of the Industrial Court it has been accepted that an employer whose position improves, and wishes to employ after a financial crisis, must give priority to the employees formerly declared redundant.
Under the Employment Act, sections 14 (5) and 16, the conditions for termination by notice by the employer apply here.
Employees who receive monthly payments must inform the employer one month before they intend to stop working.
The contract may provide for a shorter or longer period.
If employees do not give notice, they should pay to the employer the equivalent of the wages for the period of notice.
If, in addition, the workers’ resignation violates a contractual obligation to work for a specified period they may be liable for damages that the resignation caused the employer.
Such cases are few though, and difficult to prove.
Courts will not grant the specific performance remedy to an employer, i.e., they will not compel an employee to work, the employers’ only remedy being damages.
In general, when an employee resigns he or she is not entitled to severance pay.
Under the Regulation of Wages (General) Order, subsidiary to the Regulations of Wages and Conditions of Employment Act, the general working hours are 52 per week, but the normal working hours usually consist of 45 hours of work per week, Monday to Friday 8 hours each, 5 hours on Saturday under the special Orders for different sectors subsidiary to the Regulations of Wages and Conditions of Employment Act.
Collective agreements may modify the working hours, but generally provide for weekly working hours of 40 up to 52 hours per week.
Under these statutory regulations overtime shall be payable at the rates of one and one-half time hourly rate on weekdays, and at the rate of twice the basic hourly rate on Sundays and public holidays.
There are different Regulations of Wages Orders in force, covering different sectors of the economy.
Under section 7 of the Employment Act, every employee shall be entitled to no less than twenty-one working days of annual leave with full pay.
Where the employee works for less than a year, the number of days will be reduced accordingly.
This is a minimum and many contracts and collective agreements provide for annual leave of between thirty to forty-five days.
In average Kenyan employees enjoy annual leave of 24 days.
The draft Employment Act submitted by the Taskforce to the Attorney General in April 2004, within the labour law reform process, contains a provision stipulating that a woman shall no longer forfeit her annual leave entitlements.
If this provision is adopted, a woman may be entitled to two months and three weeks of leave, in a year she delivers a baby.
The same text allows the employer to be reimbursed from the funds held by the National Social Security Fund (NSSF).
In the case of adoption of this provision, the NSSF Act would have to be amended accordingly.
Further protective legislation of women workers during pregnancy and after childbirth does not exist.
The Factories Act that deals with issues of occupational safety and health does not provide any additional protection for pregnant employees in respect to pollution, and hazardous working environments.
Cash benefits and other entitlements during pregnancy, and breaks for breastfeeding are provided in selective collective agreements, without representing a general trend.
Under the Civil Service Code of Regulations public employees are entitled to study leave.
Neither the Employment Act, nor the Regulations of Wages and Conditions of Employment Act provide for an equivalent.
But in practice, many companies and employers grant employees time off to go for courses, or to prepare for examinations.
Leave for trade union purposes or because of the holding of public office
Legally binding entitlements for employees to leave the working place for the period the attendance to a public office requires, or even for trade union purposes do not exist.
But the tripartite Industrial Relation Charter, in the amended version of 30th April 1980, provides under A, section III, Employers’ Responsibilities: “That employers shall not engage in such practices as
(b) Discrimination, restraint or coercion against any employee because of recognised activity for trade unions; ()”.
And even clearer under G, Joint Consultation: “Management shall take appropriate measures to facilitate the proper functioning of joint machinery by making available facilities for meetings and in appropriate cases, the staff essential thereto including allowing representatives of the employees the necessary time, within reason, to attend meetings without loss of pay; ()”.
Children under 16 should not be employed in any industrial undertaking or to attend machinery, unless they are apprentices or learners.
“Industrial undertaking” means any of the following: any activity which relates to surface or underground extraction (like mines and quarries), any factory and any form of construction and installation (like buildings, railways, roads, tunnels, bridges, canals, sewers, drains, gas work, telegraphic, telephonic or electrical installations, or water works), and to transportation and handling of passengers or goods by road, rail or inland waterway.
Section 24 (2) (a)-(d) thereby covers most of the potentially hazardous working conditions.
With the ratification by Kenya on 7 May 2001 of the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (No.
182), and the adoption of the Children Act, 2001, a major step towards improving the protection of children against exploitation and inhuman working conditions has been done, though the system needs to be aligned now.
This will be done if the above-mentioned draft Employment Act is adopted.
This text defines the “worst forms of child labour” and prohibits it.
The Minister is given the power to identify jobs which would constitute worst form of child labour.
As noted above, section 2 of the Children Act defines "child" as any human being under the age of 18 years.
The second part of the Act, entitled "Safeguards for the rights and welfare of the child", addresses the protection of the child against economic exploitation and any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child's education, or to be harmful to the child's health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development (section 10(1)); the protection of the child against recruitment and participation in armed conflicts is addressed in section 10(2), the protection of the child against any other form of exploitation including sale, trafficking or abduction by any person in section 13(1), and the protection of the child against sexual exploitation and use in prostitution in section 15.
Under the terms of section 20 of the Act, any person who wilfully or as a consequence of culpable negligence infringes any of the provisions of sections 5 to 19 shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding 12 months or to a fine of 50,000 shillings, or both.
No protection is provided for children working in family agricultural activities or enterprises, and who are not paid.
Section 10(5) of the Children Act, 2001, defines the term "child labour" as any situation where a child provides labour in exchange for payment.
As according to the 1998/1999 Kenyan Child Labour Report, most of the children who work, or 78.7 per cent, work exactly under these circumstances.
The majority of children who work are therefore excluded from the definition of child labour contained in section 10(5) of the Children Act, 2001.
In the tripartite Industrial Relations Charter (1980) the parties agree on abolishing all discrimination among workers on the grounds of race, colour, sex, belief, tribal association or trade union affiliation including discrimination in respect of: (a) Admission to Public or private employment; (b) Labour legislation and agreements which shall afford equitable economic treatment to all those lawfully resident or working in the country; (c) Conditions of engagement and promotions; (d) Opportunities for vocational training; (e) Conditions of work; (f) Health, safety and welfare measures; (g) Discipline: (h) Participation in the negotiation of collective agreements; (i) Wage rates; which shall be fixed according to the principle of equal pay for work of equal value in the same operation and undertaking.
Workers with disabilities and persons living with HIV/AIDS
Workers with disabilities are mentioned only in the Regulations of Wages and Conditions of Employment Act, section 18 (1), which allows employment below the minimum wage for persons with disabilities.
Further regulations to prevent these groups from suffering discrimination do not exist.
As the Anti-discriminatory clauses in the current Constitution are enumerative (see above 10.1), unlike many other constitutions, not prohibiting discrimination on “any other ground” in Art 82 (3) of the Constitution, these groups are not legally protected against discrimination.
However, the above-mentioned Draft Constitution prohibits discrimination on the grounds of health status and disability (See above).
Furthermore, the above-mentioned draft Employment Act defines discrimination in the following terms: “discrimination includes any distinction, exclusion or preference made on the basis of race, colour, sex, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin, or HIV status (whether such HIV status is actual, perceived or suspected) or disability or any other arbitrary ground which has a detrimental effect on ones treatment in employment or occupation, or preventing an employee from obtaining any benefit under any contract of service.”
Section 14 (10) of the Trade Disputes Act allows the Minister of Finance to set guidelines or other directives relating to wage and salary levels.
A collective agreement that does not comply with these guidelines cannot be registered by the Industrial Court.
These guidelines are seen to be justifiable for the sake of economic stabilisation in the national economic interest.
The institution of the Income Guidelines goes back to the year 1973, when in a difficult period following the Oil Crisis, the Government felt that it had to step in and give guidance to the social partners, and to the Industrial Court in resolving the economic disputes.
However, mandatory guidelines of this type may undermine the autonomy of the parties in collective bargaining, which would not be compatible with international labour standards, specifically ILO Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No.
98).
The formation, structure and organization of trade unions in independent Kenya is clearly provided for in various national instruments, namely, Trade Unions Act, Trade Disputes Act and the Industrial Relations Charter.
The Taskforce on the review of labour law has recently submitted a draft Labour Relations Act, which repeals the two former acts when it is adopted.
The Trade Unions Act provides for the formation of staff associations, employees associations and employees’ organizations for the registration and control of trade unions.
Under the Act, section 2 (1)(a) a trade union is defined as an association or combination, whether temporary or permanent of more than six persons, whose principle objects are to regulate the relations between employees and employers.
Under this arrangement it is presumed that all employees in both the public and private sector have the freedom to join and form associations of their choice.
However, in the Industrial Relations Charter, the parties agreed that the following will be excluded from union representation:
The civil service was banned from unionisation by Presidential Decree for years.
The ILO Committee of Experts on the Application of Standards has repeatedly made requests to the Government to look into the question of the need for allowing establishment of a trade union to cater to the civil service on issues related to collective bargaining, wages, terms and conditions of service.
Similarly the Committee of Freedom of Association has persistently urged that the Government should take necessary steps to insure the right of civil servants, not engaged into the administration of the state, to establish or join organizations of their own choosing.
As a result, only recently a Civil Service Union was registered.
Membership of trade unions is open to minors above the age of 16.
They enjoy all rights of membership but are barred from holding executive posts of the trade unions until the age of 23.
A key provision of the Trade Union Act is the competence of the registrar under section 16(1)(d)(i) of the Act - which traces back to Article 80 (2) of the Constitution, as shown above (2.4.1).
This provision allows the registrar to refuse registration of an application if there already exists a registered trade union whom he or she deems “sufficiently representative of the whole or of a substantial proportion of the interest in respect of which the applicants seek registration.” Hence the government decides, whether the representation by one trade union in any given industrial sector is “sufficient” and does in effect bar registration of would be splinter groups or even new trade unions in sectors.
The Registrar’s actions have been in breach of this rule from time to time, sometimes arising out of High Court Orders to register splinter unions or out of his or her own decision .
The registration provisions – which historically go back to the Industrial Relation Charter, and which are still backed by this tripartite agreement –affect the freedom of association of employees, who should be free to join unions of their own choice.
It is the Government’s policy, under the Industrial Relations Charter, to pursue industrial trade unionism and to work in co-operation with the Federation of Kenyan Employers and the Central Organization of Trade Unions to encourage conditions, which would progressively achieve this.
Section 16(1)(d)(f) of the Trade Unions Act reinforces this position in providing that application for registration may be refused by the Registrar if persons seeking registration for an organization are engaged or work in different trades or calling and if its constitution does not contain suitable provision for protection and promotion of their respective sectional industrial interests.
To this extent, crafts and general trade unions are barred.
Strict adherence to this rule has however not been achieved as there exist trade unions which have generalist orientation, that is catering for more than one industry, such as the Kenya Union of Commercial Food and Allied Workers.
Moreover, there is the tendency of most trade unions including in their name, the term “Allied” thereby giving them way to organize workers engaged in areas which are not strictly in their principal jurisdictions.
The Registrar nonetheless has powers to require alteration of name and also call for additional information when making consideration for registration.
Other restrictions imposed by law are that, an organization may also be refused registration if the objects of its constitution are unlawful, its principal purpose is not in accord with what is set out in the Act, if the secretary or treasurer are deemed not sufficiently literate in English and Swahili language and are unable to carry out their duties adequately.
Additional grounds for refusal and cancellations are unlawful application of trade union funds, improper keeping of funds of the organization and if the trade union is being used for unlawful purpose.
There are also requirements for registration of trade union branches giving details of name, postal address of the office, titles and names of officials, their age, addresses and occupations.
Provision for registration of trade union centres has been made at section 16 (1) (d) (ii) of the Trade Unions Act.
The Registrar has powers to defer registration on any of the grounds stated in the Act and accordingly notify the parties and thereupon the organization becomes a probationary trade union in line with provisions of section 11.
Presently, there exist 37 registered trade unions currently with 35 being affiliates to the Central Organization of Trade Unions (K).
All in all, the Registrar has immense powers in matters of registration.
He or she may defer, refuse and suspend registration of a trade union.
Section 18(1) of the Trade Unions Act grant leave to parties aggrieved by the decisions of the Registrar to appeal to the High Court, whereupon he or she has right to be heard.
Registration of Trade Unions under the draft Labour Relations Act
The draft Labour Relations Act finalized by the Taskforce in April 2004, lays down a new registration procedure.
It defines a trade union as “an association of employees whose principal purpose is to regulate relations between employees and employers, including any employer’s organisation”.
Unlike the definition now in force, this new definition does not require a minimum of members to be defined as a trade union.
For a trade union to be registered under this text, this procedure must be followed: First of all, the persons who wish to recruit members for the purpose of establishing a trade union must obtain a certificate from the Registrar.
The application for such a certificate must be signed by two persons promoting the establishment of the trade union.
Within six months of receiving the certificate, the trade union must apply to the Registrar for registration.
In order to be registered, the trade union must comply with certain requirements laid down in the draft.
One of them is that the decision to register was made at a meeting attended by at least 50 members of the trade union.
Part V of the Trade Unions Act expressly grants immunity to trade unions, its officers and members, without any distinction, from any proceedings or civil suits in respect of any acts done in contemplation or in furtherance of a trade dispute.
They have liability in tort and in contract.
Indeed, probationary trade unions enjoy all rights and privileges accorded registered trade unions, except they have no rights to amalgamation.
Kenyan trade unions are sector based; nevertheless, some are general unions operating beyond individual industries.
An example is the Kenya Union of Commercial, Food and Allied Workers which represents workers in varied sectors like banking, food, retail and financial.
The big Teachers’ union (Kenya National Union of Teachers, KNUT) is not affiliated to COTU (K) – the national Confederation of Trade Unions.
Presently, there exist 37 registered trade unions, with 35 being affiliated to the Central Organization of Trade Unions (K).
According to COTU about 244,000 individual members belong to its affiliated unions today.
There has been remarkable decline in trade union membership since the mid 1990s when retrenchment started.
To revamp the decline, COTU has raised the minimum contribution from the previous 10.

to 50.

per month.
Collective agreement is defined in the Trade Disputes Act as “ an agreement made between a trade union and an employer or organization of employers which relates to terms and conditions of employment, whether or not enforceable in law and whether or not concluded under machinery for negotiation.” A collective bargaining process precedes this.
The process of collective bargaining is not specifically provided for in law, but there are prerequisite conditions, which must be fulfilled before parties may proceed with bargaining process.
Such conditions are contained in the Trade Unions Act, the Trade Disputes Act and the Industrial Relations Charter.
In section 5(2) of the Trade Disputes Act, there is a requirement that the trade union must have legal recognition in law that is duly registered by having a constitutional jurisdiction.
Secondly, it must have a simple majority of 51% of unionisable employees in the undertaking, which it seeks to negotiate with, and thirdly there should not be any rival union.
Appendix A of the Industrial Relations Charter offers a model parties recognition agreement and it marks out collective claims and grievances as part of the negotiation procedure.
The model requires that either the General Secretary or his or her authorized representatives of the trade union may raise such claims with the management in writing three months before expiration of existing agreements.
All agreements must be reduced to writing.
Part III of the Trade Disputes Act, requires that collective agreements be lodged with the Minister fourteen days of its execution and thereafter furnishes it with the Industrial Court for purposes of registration.
The Minister may object to the registration if he or she deems it undesirable for registration.
As discussed above the Registrar and the Industrial Court are bound by guidelines and directives issued by the Minister responsible for finance on matters relating to wages and salaries and other terms and conditions of employment.
In cases where the Minister has made objection to registration, the Industrial Court may summon parties to hear them out.
It is an offence to implement a collective agreement before the Industrial Court registers it.
Once so registered, the collective agreement binds parties to comply with the commitments made under it.
Failure to perform by either party gives rise to a trade dispute which is dealt with in accordance of the provisions of the Act.
In general, collective agreements have a duration span of up to two years before renewal by parties.
Collective agreements modify individual contracts.
Benefits are extended to non-union members serving in enterprises where they are in force.
This arises from the constitutional provisions which protect freedom of association, and the Industrial Relations Charter which prohibits discrimination, but it is contentious issue vividly discussed among union members.
Agreements may be denounced by mutual agreement of the parties with adequate notice being served by the initiating party.
A report must be made in writing to the Minister after twenty-eight days have elapsed since the date on which the dispute was reported and the period of notice specified in recognition or registered collective agreement has expired.
In Part II of the Act, a disputes settlement machinery is established and under section 5 the Minister has alternative actions that he or she may take upon receipt of a report of trade disputes.
He or she may inform the parties that matters on which the dispute has arisen are not suitable to be dealt with under the Act, or refuse to accept the dispute if the reported matter is barred by a parties recognition agreement or collective agreement.
Trade unions generally have relied on their right to strike in order to secure the enforcement of an award in their favour.
As a result of the provision that an award becomes part of any individual contract concerned, the employee may sue an employer for breach of contract if he or she fails to implement the Industrial Courts award.
Both employees and employers have the right to industrial action and this is guaranteed in both the Trade Disputes Act and the Industrial Relations Charter.
In the interest of employees the Trade Disputes Act confers this right to strike which it interprets as “the cessation of work by a body of persons employed in any trade or industry acting in combination, or a concerted refusal under a common understanding of any number of persons who are, or have been so employed, to continue to work or to accept employment and includes any interruption or slowing down of work by any number of persons employed in any trade or industry acting in concert or under a common understanding including any action commonly known as a sit down strike or a go slow.”
In the case of strikes in the Public Sector, the Minister may take such appropriate action that would effect settlement of disputes in line with the specific set regulations (section 27, Trade Disputes Act).
He or she may also order the parties to adhere to their agreements or any Court award.
Section 30 of the Trade Disputes Act outlaws sympathetic strikes and lockouts.
All Ministerial orders on matters concerning strikes and lock outs can be subject to appeal to the Industrial Court.
It may only take cognisance of the matter when the parties have ceased taking part in the strike or lock out.
Persons who declare or instigate or incite others to take part in an unlawful strike or lock out are guilty of offence and are liable to pay a fine.
On the other hand persons who refuse to take part in unlawful strikes or lockouts are protected from expulsion, deprivation of any rights or benefits under section 35 of the Trade Disputes Act.
There is a further seven days strike notice requirement to be served to the Minister in the case of essential services.
Not all categories of workers have the right to seek, initiate and conduct a strike action.
Firstly there are those who are effectively excluded by the Proclamation from its scope of application.
Secondly, there are workers who do not have the right to strike under the provision of the Trade Disputes Act, sections 36, 43, First Schedule, on the ground they are engaged in essential services.
These services are defined in the First Schedule and include:
Numerically, the workers engaged in the province of what the law calls essential services constitute a sizable ratio of the population of trade union membership in the country.
Furthermore, it is in these enterprises that the more qualified (and probably politically conscious) labour force is to be found.
The above-mentioned draft Labour Relations Act provides for alternative means of dispute resolutions, by way of a collective agreement.
It stipulates that a collective agreement may provide for the conciliation or arbitration of any category of trade disputes identified in the collective agreement by an independent and impartial conciliator or arbitrator appointed by agreement between the parties.
In the case of conciliation, there is no requirement to refer the dispute to the Minister.
In the case of arbitration, the award is final and binding.
It may not be subject to appeal to any court, but it may be reviewed by the National Labour Court and enforced by it.
But this text remains a draft for the time being and must still be adopted to have any legal effect.
A fully-fledged system of labour courts does not exist in Kenya.
As mentioned earlier, individual labour disputes are dealt with by the ordinary courts.
Under the Constitution of Kenya, the Magistrates’ Courts Act and the Civil Procedure Act such cases may be filed in the High Court, or in any of the Magristrates’ Courts.
Nevertheless, there is another alternative open to an individual with a labour dispute under the Employment Act, section 40.
The entry to the ordinary court system is simplified and modified according to the special needs of the labour sector: under section 40, disputes arising from employment can be forwarded to either the labour officer, or a magistrate.
The Labour Officer is expected to try all he or she can do to settle the dispute.
Where he or she fails or feels unable to solve it, he or she may refer it to the magistrate.
The magistrate then has the power to hear the dispute, even though it may be outside his or her normal powers.
In effect, employees who may be unable to act through trade unions are in disadvantage.
Indeed, the access to the Industrial Court is limited by the rule of practice and only trade union disputes can be heard by the Industrial Court.
Not only do they suffer from stiffer formality and rigidity of procedure in the ordinary courts, but they will not be entitled to reinstatement.
However, as mentioned above, the Taskforce on the review of labour law has written a draft Labour Institutions Act, which was submitted to the Attorney General in April 2004 to go through the adoption procedure.
This text introduces a system of labour law courts, at two levels (Subordinate Labour Courts and the National Labour Court), which will have exclusive jurisdiction over labour law disputes.
The procedure before these courts will be open for individuals.

Europe's new charter of citizens rights has been toughened to enshrine the explicit right to strike and union consultation "at all levels", on key decisions affecting workers.
Europe's new charter of citizens rights has been toughened to enshrine the explicit right to strike and union consultation "at all levels", on key decisions affecting workers.
The latest version of the Charter of Fundamental Rights was welcomed by trade unions, but its emphasis on workers' entitlements flies in the face of opposition from the British Government, which has sought to minimise social and economic rights.
A spokesman for the European Trade Union Confederation said the draft was "moving in the right direction".
Giampiero Alhadeff, secretary general of Solidar, an umbrella group of unions and non-governmental organisations, said the charter had been "pulled back from the brink".
In a statement, the CBI said the rights to strike "would raise the possibility of cross-border industrial action when secondary strike action has been illegal in the UK since the 80s".
(2) if such employee is a home worker in Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands, not less than the minimum piece rate prescribed by regulation or order; or, if no such minimum piece rate is in effect, any piece rate adopted by such employer which shall yield, to the proportion or class of employees prescribed by regulation or order, not less than the applicable minimum hourly wage rate.
Such minimum piece rates or employer piece rates shall be commensurate with, and shall be paid in lieu of, the minimum hourly wage rate applicable under the provisions of this section.
The Administrator, or his authorized representative, shall have power to make such regulations or orders as are necessary or appropriate to carry out any of the provisions of this paragraph, including the power without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to define any operation or occupation which is performed by such home work employees in Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands; to establish minimum piece rates for any operation or occupation so defined; to prescribe the method and procedure for ascertaining and promulgating minimum piece rates; to prescribe standards for employer piece rates, including the proportion or class of employees who shall receive not less than the minimum hourly wage rate; to define the term “home worker”; and to prescribe the conditions under which employers, agents, contractors, and subcontractors shall cause goods to be produced by home workers;
(1) No employer having employees subject to any provisions of this section shall discriminate, within any establishment in which such employees are employed, between employees on the basis of sex by paying wages to employees in such establishment at a rate less than the rate at which he pays wages to employees of the opposite sex in such establishment for equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions, except where such payment is made pursuant to
(3) For purposes of administration and enforcement, any amounts owing to any employee which have been withheld in violation of this subsection shall be deemed to be unpaid minimum wages or unpaid overtime compensation under this chapter.
A shorter working week is set to become the new norm, according to a report out this week from nef (the new economics foundation), the UK’s leading independent think tank.
According to nef, there are several forces pushing us towards a shorter working week: lasting damage to the economy caused by the banking crisis, an increasingly divided society with too much over-work alongside too much unemployment, and an urgent need for deep cuts in environmentally damaging over-consumption.
These combine with a growing interest in people spending more time producing and delivering a share of their own goods and services – from co-produced care and neighbourhood-based activities, to food, clothing and other necessities.
Today, nearly 2.5 million people can’t find jobs.
Cutting labour to save money without changing working hours means some are burdened with overwork while others lose their livelihoods.
The authors of 21 hours argue that a much shorter working week could help to tackle a range of urgent and closely related problems: overwork, unemployment, over-consumption, high carbon emissions, low well-being, entrenched inequalities, and the lack of time to live sustainably, to care for each other, and simply to enjoy life.
It would enable many more people to join the workforce and allow for measures to reduce damaging levels of inequality.
Andrew Simms, co-author of the report and Policy Director at nef said: “The last two years revealed many to be consuming well beyond our economic means and beyond the limits of the natural environment, yet in ways that also fail to improve our well-being.
Meanwhile many others suffer poverty and hunger.
Our research shows that moving to a shorter working week could be the only way left untried to square this seemingly impossible circle.
A cultural shift will throw up real challenges, but there could also be massive benefits for our economy, our quality of life and our planet.
After all, hands up who wouldn’t like a four day weekend?”
The basis of the employee’s claim was that an adverse finding in the disciplinary proceedings would expose him to statutory procedures that would prevent him from working with children.
The Court of Appeal summarised the relevant procedures, by reference to three phases in the employment vetting regime: (i) the “list 99” procedure, under section 142 of the Education Act 2002, prohibiting certain individuals from working in education; (ii) the transitional regime, under the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 (”the 2006 Act”), whereby after 20th January 2009 certain cases under section 142 were referred to the new Independent Safeguarding Authority (ISA); and (iii) the substantive regime under the 2006 Act, whereby list 99 was replaced with effect from 12th October 2009 by the “children’s barred list”, established under section 2(1)(a) of the 2006 Act.
The Court of Appeal considered whether the school disciplinary proceedings were a determinant of the employee’s civil right to practise his profession as a teaching assistant, so as to engage article 6 of the ECHR.
Dismissal by the governors would not itself preclude the employee from practising his profession.
A decision to include the employee on a statutory barring list would, however, have that effect.
The question was whether the disciplinary proceedings had a substantial influence or effect on the barring proceedings, and therefore on the determination of the employee’s civil right to practise his profession.
The answer was yes: therefore, the disciplinary proceedings engaged article 6.
The Court went on to consider whether article 6 required that the employee should be entitled to legal representation in the disciplinary proceedings.
Article 6 did not entail a right to legal representation in every case: but in this case there was such a right, given the seriousness of what was at stake for the employee, and given the potential for legal representation to make a difference to the outcome.
The governors were a public authority under the Human Rights Act 1998, and therefore subject to the duty under section 6(1) of that Act, not to act incompatibly with Convention rights.
The implications of the Court of Appeal’s decisions for private sector employers are uncertain.
Such employers are not subject to the section 6(1) duty, and are not susceptible to judicial review.
But in an unfair dismissal claim against a private sector employer, the employee might well rely on Governors of X School in order to argue that a failure to permit legal representation would render any dismissal unfair.
In March this year the Information Commissioner took enforcement action against the Consulting Association, which had been operating a secret blacklist of employees in the construction industry, including details of trade union activity.
We posted about this story here , earlier this year.
The trade union UCATT commissioned a report from the Institute of Employment Rights about the proposed regulations.
The report , by Professor Keith Ewing, was published on 15th September 2009: it is entitled “Ruined Lives”, and deals specifically with blacklisting in the construction industry.
It includes sample material from Consulting Association files.
The report gives a fascinating history of the practice of blacklisting, going back to the late 19th century.
It suggests a number of changes to the draft Regulations, including: that keeping or using a blacklist, or supplying information to it, should be a criminal offence; and that there should be a right to compensation for the fact of being included on a blacklist, even if the inclusion does not lead to any loss.
In March this year the Information Commissioner took enforcement action against the Consulting Association, which had been operating a secret blacklist of employees in the construction industry, including details of trade union activity.
Today the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform has announced that new regulations will be introduced to outlaw the use of blacklists in this way.
There is a power to regulate under section 3 of the Employment Relations Act 1999, but so far it has never been used.
A consultation exercise is promised for early summer.
Draft regulations were previously prepared in 2003, and there was full consultation; so this time round the consultation will be shorter than the normal 12 week period.
Another subject raised in discussion was the recent decision of the Administrative Court in R(G) v Governors of X School and Y City Council .
A music assistant employed at a primary school was dismissed; the allegation was that he had formed an inappropriate relationship with a 15 year old boy who was on work experience at the school.
The school’s disciplinary committee told the employee that they would be reporting the case to the Secretary of State for potential inclusion in “list 99″ (i.e.
the statutory list of those banned from working in schools).
The Court quashed the decision because the school had refused to allow legal representation at the dismissal hearing or at a forthcoming appeal.
The disciplinary proceedings, and the referral to the Secretary of State for a potential banning direction, formed part of one and the same proceedings.
Those proceedings were not criminal in nature for the purpose of article 6 of the Convention.
However, their potential consequences were grave; and procedural fairness required the claimant to be allowed legal representation, before both the school’s disciplinary committee and its appeal committee.
The wages, conditions and livelihoods of airport workers in Britain are being systematically destroyed in a combined offensive by management and the trade unions.
Airline workers are being picked off section by section, with ground crew staff, security, firefighters and cabin crew facing drastic attacks on their living standards.
Last week the Unite union agreed a below inflation pay deal with management of BAA, which owns six British Airports including Heathrow and London Stansted.
Under the deal 8,400 employees, including security, firefighting and ground handling staff, will receive a 2 percent pay rise, a one-off bonus payment and other bonus payments linked to a productivity increase.
The 2 percent deal is a de facto pay cut as inflation now stands at 5 percent.
The stitch-up of the BAA workers came only a week after Unite, the GMB union and BA management agreed that 3,000 BA ground crew workers will face pay cuts and up to 500 “voluntary” job losses.
‘Some 200 workers have already been forced to leave.
A pay freeze until October 2010 has been implemented and flexibility arrangements will be introduced.
This is also being put to a ballot, with the unions recommending acceptance.
Unite and Unison, the two largest unions in Britain, with a combined membership of more than 3.3 million, have been instrumental in blocking calls for a token protest march to coincide with the announcement of Chancellor George Osborne’s spending review in October.
This position was endorsed by the majority of the Trades Union Congress in July.
In the trade unions, workers face an organised conspiracy to suppress the class struggle.
Unite cited comments from the CC OO, which said it had “been monitoring the situation at BA very closely and is extremely concerned with the way senior BA management have instigated a conflict-based approach to industrial relations in the current dispute with Cabin Crew.
Originally, nearly 200 of the workers were charged with sedition under an anti-terror law passed during Franco’s fascist dictatorship.
The 23 were eventually charged and convicted under public order offences.
The CC OO is affiliated to the Stalinist Communist Party of Spain and, despite declaring the sentencing “unjust”, did nothing to defend the workers, as was the case with the General Workers Union (UGT) trade union.
Following the case the CC OO said it would analyse “more deeply the facts”—as if they have not had four years to do so already.
The trade union bureaucracy has been ably assisted by the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) and Socialist Party (SP).
An SWP article published August 17 acknowledged that Unite had negotiated a pay cut, but then meekly complained that Unite should have held a new strike ballot in July to “enable BA workers to strike officially.”
The fake-left tendencies function as a PR department for the trade union bureaucracy.
Their defence of what can only be termed “yellow” company unions is a deliberate act of political betrayal.
Unite et al differ from earlier yellow unions only in that they have far greater resources to employ in imposing the dictates of management.
A pre-condition for any successful struggle is for workers to break with the trade unions and set up their own popular rank-and-file organisations, from which all representatives of the bureaucracy must be excluded as a fifth column of management.

An occupational physician is a general medical practitioner who has completed a specialization/residency period in occupational medicine and health, and is certified to work in this field.
Occupational physicians are engaged in prevention (pre-employment medical examinations), diagnosis (biological monitoring and periodical examinations) as well as in taking care and rehabilitating workers who have been either injured in work accidents or have become ill due to various occupational diseases.
Hazard of being violently attacked by victims of work-related injuries and/or by patients who contracted occupational diseases and are unhappy with the treatment they have received, with the limitations set upon them, with the workers' compensation settlement
A Doctor of Occupational Medicine (occupational physician) is a general medical practitioner certified as an “occupational health expert” (Note 1), who works in “occupational medicine”.
Occupational physicians should understand relative place of occupational medicine within the national health system; he should have good knowledge of occupational medicine, including epidemiology (Note 2), and be familiar with work methodology and with the specific “work areas” within “occupational-medicine (Note 3).
Duties may include: doing occupational anamnesis; organizing occupational clinics within the industrial plant; dealing with occupational legislation issues; determining presence of an occupational disease and the ability of the employee to continue doing his work; analysis of an industrial plant from the occupational hazard point of view; job analysis; occupational rehabilitation; occupational safety and hygiene; primary and occupational medicine; ergonomics; issue of permits and of worker limitations at work.
2.
The methodology of occupational medicine includes: early recognition of risk factors; prevention of occupational diseases; promotion of health and occupational health education; occupational medicine records and administration.
The specific areas of interest include the following: Pre-employment evaluation of worker’s health, as well as periodical evaluations; Medical supervision of workers influenced by risk-factors; Evaluation of worker’s work-potential; Rehabilitation of workers that contracted occupational disease or injury; Environmental health; Evaluation of the work environment.

ACAS has set up a flexible working arbitration scheme to deal with this type of dispute.
You can find out more on the ACAS website at
the right of all pregnant women to claim unfair dismissal if dismissed because of pregnancy (see under heading Dismissal or unfair treatment because of pregnancy )
altering your working conditions or hours of work so you are not put at risk, for example, a shop assistant could be given a chair so she does not have to stand for long periods.
Other examples are, a person working at a computer could be given a more comfortable chair or more breaks and a woman whose job entails some lifting could have someone else do the lifting for her
if altering your working conditions or hours is not possible, the employer must consider offering you different work, at the same pay
If you are dismissed because of pregnancy, you can make a claim for unfair dismissal and sex discrimination to an employment tribunal (Industrial Tribunal in Northern Ireland).
It does not matter how long you have worked for your employer or whether you work full or part-time.
This is because the law says that it is automatically unfair to dismiss a woman because she is pregnant.
The second, most voluminous part of the ILO report is titled, "Mapping Economic Security.
" In fact, it deals with aspects of the political economy of insecurity in the early 21st-century world.
The chapter headings here give an idea of the scope of ILO’s approach.
They include income security, labor market security, employment security, job security, voice representation security, and several others.
While ILO does not identify those interests, it details some of the curtailments, or proposed curtailments, of State-sponsored programs that would sustain income security.
Regarding publicly financed pensions, for example, the World Bank, in its influential 1994 report, Averting the Old Age Crisis, recommends that the retirement age be raised; the "rewards" of early retirement be eliminated; and that benefit levels be downsized.
It would also "launch the private pillar" as the "public pillar" is being reformed.
These proposals are in the process of being widely adopted.
Unemployment benefits and insurance systems underpinning them have long been another State-sponsored income maintenance program, particularly in the industrial countries.
Most of the entitlement features of the programs have become more restrictive.
For example, the qualifying period for benefit eligibility has been increased; the duration of benefit entitlement has been cut; and so forth.
In developing countries, unemployment insurance systems are "rareand when they do exist few unemployed are covered by them.
"
Basic to economic and income security are conditions in labor markets, employment, and work places.
ILO defines labor market security as availability of adequate income-earning opportunities, or where the supply of workers approximates the demand for them.
However, labor markets in the early 21st century are pervaded by insecurity, says ILO.
It arises from a combination of unemployment, contingent employment, and the resort to informal work by otherwise redundant jobseekers.
While worldwide unemployment is estimated at 6.2 percent of a global labor force of about 3 billion, relevant data from China and the Russian Federation remain inconclusive because many workers are on extended layoffs or unpaid leave.
There are millions of such workers, and they are not officially considered to be unemployed.
But in fact they are, owing largely to closure or restructuring of State-owned enterprises and the inability of private-sector businesses to absorb them.
In its chapter on voice representation security, ILO stresses that 141 countries had ratified its convention relating to workers’ freedom to organize, and 152 had granted workers’ right to bargain collectively.
Yet, "in the era of globalization, the capacity for voice mechanisms to influence policies and outcomes has been eroded in countries where it was relatively strong and has been weakenedin many places where it was already weak.
" Trade unions have lost members; have found it increasingly difficult to organize, especially part-time and casual workers; have been unable to make headway in countries with large informal sectors; and have been inhibited by international competition in pushing aggressively for wage and benefit hikes.
ILO surveys in various countries found that workers did not generally think trade unions were very effective in resolving their problems.
A significant exception was China.
Notwithstanding repression of worker demands "often with violence," attitudes toward trade unions were found to be generally positive.
"Over one-half of Chinese workers said they had reasonable opportunities to bring grievances to their trade union representatives.
" Only a minority lodge complaints with a Government agency.
Overall, it is a refrain of the ILO report that workers are indifferent and passive concerning trade unions.
Exceptions, such as the role South African workers played in bringing about the end of apartheid or that of the Polish workers in compelling the end of military dictatorship, show that great political objectives and democratic ideals inspire unity and activism among working people.
ILO believes that forms of workers’ voice representation in the 21st century will "look very different from the trade unions of the 19th and 20th centuries.
" The tripartism that characterized labor relations in Western Europe has seen its day.
Hence, ILO approaches voice representation as an issue to be viewed in global terms.
Thus, it endorses the idea of an Economic Security Council as part of the United Nations.
It urges that ministries of labor and welfare partake in the work of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
It notes that while the linking of labor standards to trade has been rejected by the WTO, it insists on some form of institutional regulation that helps workers and others to be protected against "the race to the bottom," caused by competition for investment and low-cost labor.
It would seek to formulate internationally agreed upon rules of competition.

'i LSI SENIORITY AND JOB SECURITY It has only recently been widely realized that security of job tenure is at least as important to the worker as wages, hours, or other conditions of employment.
The depression of the early thirties and the severe unemployment that accompanied it have led most people to value job security more highly, in comparison with individual opportunity, than they had in the past.
Seniority, as defined by the United States Department of Labor, is: .
. .
the principle granting preference to employees in certain phases of em- ployment in accordance with length of service.
The principal aim of a sen- iority program is to afford the maximum security and reward to those who have rendered longest service.
* With a strict seniority system, decisions on lay-offs, re-hiring, and (sometimes) promotion are not left solely to the discretion of foremen or other representatives of management.
Instead, a straight and clear-cut formula serves as a guide.
The first seniority provisions appeared on the railroads about fifty years ago.
Numerous sales and consolidation of lines gave fre- quent opportunity for discrimination in the discharge or reassign- ment of employees.
Among the first demands of the railroad unions were those for the application of strict seniority rights in case of lay-off, re-hire, prornotion, transfer, and assignment to various runs.
The seasonal nature of many industries — and the resulting frequency of lay-off and re-hiring — caused a special desire of the regular employees for job protection.
With the rise of mass-produc- tion industries and the development of industrial unionism, the desire for seniority protection became even greater.
There was the case of older workers, who, in semi-skilled jobs in mass-production industries w^ere especially likely to be displaced by younger, more vigorous and rapid workers.
In addition, it was difficult for man- agement in huge factories, employing thousands of w^orkers in skilled, semi-skilled, and unskilled classifications, to determine w^ho merited promotions.
The desire, too, of the new industrial unions to demonstrate their strength in job protection undoubtedly was a large factor in their insistence on seniority systems.

The principle of seniority helps, no doubt, to clear up many problems resulting from discrimination and favoritism (or the suspicion that they are present, which has an ecjually bad effect on morale, and consecjuently on the efficiency of the workers).
It is, however, a rather complicated standard, with many administrative problems that must be carefully considered if it is to function smoothly.
There is no one standard which can be used to cover all seniority provisions.
The variations in types of provisions are tremendous, and each industry, each company, each plant or shop, has to work out its own system — one that is adapted to the particular situation.
Seniority plans differ in many respects, such as the scope of the seniority list, the calculation of length of service, the kinds of deci- sions that are determined by seniority, the extent to which facts other than length of service may be considered, and the conditions under which seniority is earned and lost.
Generally speaking, most seniority provisions follow a pattern within a particular industry, with variations depending on the plant.
Some of the different types of seniority will be considered below.
Quotations from labor agree- ments are given to illustrate many of these types.
Differences in the Scope of the Seniority List Plant-wide Seniority.
Plant seniority is probably the simplest form of seniority to establish, and under some conditions is the most difficult to operate.
There is but one seniority list for the entire plant.
The position of each employee on the list depends on his length of service, regardless of the jobs he has held in the plant.
The following is an example of such a provision in a typical agree- ment in the chemical industry: The Company and the Union recognize and accept the principle of seniority and agree to apply it according to the following provisions: a. Plant seniority of an employee is measured by the years, months and days from the start of his continuous service.
This type of seniority provision works most satisfactorily when there is not too sharp a difference in the kind of skill required for the various jobs.
If the work were diversified, too much time might be spent in testing ability and re-training employees for new, un- SENIORITY AND JOB SECURITY J familiar jobs whenever there is an expansion or contraction of the work force.
Plant-wide seniority usually permits one employee to ''bump" another with less seniority, if he has the ability to perform the job.
"Bumping" means that an employee displaced from one job can retain his employment by replacing a worker with less seniority on any job that he can perform.
This process of displacement may be carried all the way down the line through the whole plant.
Several employees may change jobs as a result of one lay-off.
This can be a very disruptive practice within a plant if the employees are not easily interchangeable because of job similarity.
This type of seniority provision gives the high-service employee maximum job security by giving him the greatest opportunity of replacing an- other employee.
For the same reason, it places those recently hired in the most vulnerable position.
Departmental Seniority.
Under departmental seniority there is a separate seniority list for each department.
An employee on a discontinued job can replace someone in his own department, but not in other departments.
For this type of seniority, length of service may be calculated by any one of several methods.
Seniority may be computed for each department in which the employee had worked.
He retains his seniority in each department.
If he is forced out of the department in which he is working, he can exercise his seniority in any of the departments in which he has previously worked, displacing any employee with less seniority there.
Another type of provision permits seniority only for the de- partment in which the employee is currently working and computes it from the time he started to work in the department.
Such a pro- vision does not recognize the employee's right to seniority in de- partments in which he has previously worked.
In another type of provision seniority is good only for the department in which the employee has worked longest.
The pro- vision given below is from a typical agreement in the machine-tool industry: Departmental seniority will be established .
. .
and all employees who have worked the majority of their time in any given department will be con- sidered employees of only that department.
Combinations of Plant and Departmental Seniority.
Since neither plant nor departmental seniority has proved full\' satis- 6 SENIORITY AND JOB SECURITY factory, there has been an attempt to combine the two.
The com- binations have generally produced better results.
The following provision in a labor agreement illustrates a simple type of combination : When conditions warrant an increase or decrease in the number of em- ployees in the plant, the principle of plant-wide seniority shall apply.
When conditions warrant an increase or decrease in the number of employees in a particular group or department, then the principle of department seniority shall apply.
Some contracts provide for lay-offs to be based on plant seniority, and for promotions to be based on departmental seniority.
A provision that is often favored by both unions and manage- ment is one by which seniority is calculated on the basis of the employee's total service with the company, but can be exercised only within his present department.
In case of a lay-off, the employee cannot displace any other em- ployee with shorter service in any other department, iTor can he apply for a promotion in any other department.
In the event of a re-hire after a lay-off, he can be re-hired only in the department in which he was last working.
He is laid off, however, after any employees who have worked in the department a longer time than he, but whose total plant service is less than his.
Management prefers a combination system such as this, be- cause it makes employees more willing to transfer than they would be if they did not carry their accumulated seniority with them.
Likewise, it is more feasible than a straight plant-wide seniority sys- tem where "bumping" would prevail aiid where extensive re-train- ing of displaced employees would be necessary.
Although it is true that no seniority gives an employee a claim to a job unless he has the ability to perform it, still some time may be lost in testing the presence of that ability; and even if the ability is unquestioned, it takes some time for an employee shifting to another job to attain normal efficiency.
Many unions prefer this plan also because the employees can better afford to accept promotions, and because fewer employees are adversely affected by the elimination of one job.
Another combination is found in some labor agreements ; one that provides for departmental seniority in skilled and semi-skilled jobs, and plant-wide seniority for unskilled jobs.
This means that a skilled or semi-skilled worker may, in the event of a lav-off', dis- SENIORITY AND JOB SECURITY / place an employee with less seniority in his own department.
In the event, however, that there is no such opportunity, he may join the unskilled labor pool of the plant and receive whatever work there is available according to this total length of service in the plant.
An instance of this type of provision occurs in the following agree- ment in the automotive industry: Employees having one year's seniority or more who have exhausted their seniority .
. .
(in their department and division) .
. .
shall be placed in the plant in line with seniority by the Employment Department on any job they have worked or on any job for which they are qualified.
Craft or Occupational Seniority.
Under this type of seniority there is a separate list for each craft or occupation regardless of the department in which it is located.
It is well suited to plants where the same skill is used in more than one department.
It has in general the advantages of departmental seniority and avoids the disad- vantages of plant-wide seniority.
The same variations are possible here as under departmental seniority.
Application of Seniority The question of the application of seniority is very important and is often not adequately specified in collective agreements.
Does seniority apply only in lay-off and re-hire?
Is it to be considered also in promotions and transfers ?
Where seniority provisions exist they always apply to lay-off and re-hiring.
Sometimes they apply also to promotion and transfer.
^Management generally is more opposed to seniority for promo- tions than to seniority for lay-ofif and re-hiring.
Seniority may pre- vent the promotion of the best qualified employee, and may thus reduce the incentive for good work.
Moreover, the best employees mav quit and seek employment where their ability will receive quicker recognition.
Management therefore usually seeks to limit seniority to the problem of job security.
The union, on the other hand, may fear that the management might discriminate against union members in making promotions.
Deviations from Straight Seniority Straight seniority exists where length of service is the only fact that determines the decision.
Other facts are often considered.
8 SENIORITY AND JOB SECURITY Sometimes they are carefully listed.
In other cases there is a general provision to permit exceptions to straight seniority.
An example of this provision occurs in the following typical agreement in the food processing industry: When it becomes necessary to disregard strict seniority, each case will be considered by the Joint Relations Committee, and full consideration will be given to their recommendations.
Ability. In most cases seniority applies only if the employee has the ability to do the job.
In some cases skill and ability are the first considerations, and seniority governs only between employees whose skill and ability are approximately equal.
Skill is often given more consideration in promotion than in lay-off.
Seniority is qualified most often by skill and ability in cases of transfers and promotions and by "ability to do the job" in cases of lay-off and re-hire.
One type of contract states that promotions will be based on length of service, skill, and ability, and may include any of the following qualifications: knowledge, experience, physical fitness, character, attendance and safety record, family status, and place of residence.
When other qualifications are equal, length of service will govern.
An example of this type of provision is found in a chemical industry agreement, as follows: In promotions, transfers, or the filling of new jobs or vacancies, ability, skill and seniority shall be the determining factors, but where ability and skill are approximately equal, seniority shall govern.
The second type of contract states that a vacant or new job will be posted, and senior employees will have first chance to try for the job.
If the senior employee can do the job to the satisfaction of management, he is to have the job.
If he cannot do the job, he will be returned to his old one, with no loss of seniority.
The following example is taken from a typical agreement in the public utilities industry: The parties hereto agree ... to the system of posting and bidding" for the filling of vacancies .... A. Where there is an opportunity for advancement, the employee having the longest continuous service record with the Company shall be the first considered for employment.
Promotion shall depend on the employee's length of service and qualifications as to skill, knowledge, experience, character, physical fitness, attendance, safety record and performance on other jobs.
SENIORITY AND JOB SECURITY V The award of jobs under the posting and bidding system will be dis- cussed by the Company and the Union before any award is made permanent.
For this purpose the Union will appoint a subcommittee of the General Labor Relations Committee.
B. If, after a promotion, an employee is found to be unsuited for the duties of the new position, he shall return to his former job with- out loss of seniority.
The determination of ability has always been a controversial question.
The right of management to determine ability has been challenged bv unions which state that this right would lead to the same arbitrary decisions that seniority provisions are designed to eliminate.
As a general rule the unions can challenge a manage- ment decision on ability through the use of the grievance procedure.
In order that there may be some objective measurement of ability, many plants have evolved tests to rate ability.
Unions have usuallv not been receptive to such tests, except in cases in which thev participate in their formulation and administration.
In this connection, it should be remembered that when the union insists on an inflexible seniority system, it is an indication of a feeling of insecuritv and a fear that management is not prepared to deal fairly with the union.
When a union is convinced that management will bargain in good faith and respect the union, more flexible interpre- tations of seniority provisions and other provisions within the con- tract generally result.
"Exceptional" Employees.
Many contracts contain clauses giving management the right, in the event of a lay-off, to exempt from seniority provisions certain "exceptional" employees.
These exceptional employees are generally recognized as being men who are necessary to maintain efficiency in the plant when production is low.
or whose skills are especially needed during a retooling period.
An example from an agreement in the food processing industrv is an illustration of such clauses: Lay-off and re-hiring shall be by plant seniority, and where a part only of the employees are to be laid off or re-hired, employees shall be retained or re-hired ... in order of their seniority, except so far as insuring efficient and continuous operation of the plant may.
in the Company's judgment re- quire retaining or re-hiring, out of their seniority order, employees having special skill, experience, and/or ability.
10 SENIORITY AND JOB SECURITY Some limit, such as 10 per cent of the working force, is often placed on the number of employees that mav be designated by management as "exceptional.
" Acquiring Seniority New employees are generally hired on probation.
For a certain length of time (usually between 30 and 90 days) they may be dis- charged for any reason that management deems sufficient.
During this time these employees hold no seniority rights whatsoever and generally are laid off before any work-sharing plan goes into effect.
After their probational period is over, they receive full seniority rights, and their seniority dates from the time of their hiring.
The following is an example from a typical agreement in the petroleum industry: All employees for their first thirty (30) day period of their employment are on probation and their services may be terminated durino- that time at the employer's discretion, provided, however, this section shall not abrogate such employee's rights of promotion and demotion.
Special Questions Loss of Seniority.
The most frequent reasons for loss of sen- iority are: (1) discharge for cause, (2) voluntary quitting, (3) pro- longed lay-off, and (4) failure to report promptly when called back to work.
Occasionally additional causes for loss of seniority are included in contracts.
In a few cases the seniority grade of an employee may be lowered as a penalty for breach of discipline.
Leaves of Absence.
Leaves of absence are usually granted for specified periods of time in case of military service, maternity, union business, or for any other reason regarded as valid.
During such leaves of absence seniority is retained, and usually continues to accumulate.
Seniority is lost if the employee does not return to work when his leave expires or obtain an extension of leave.
The illustration given below is taken from a typical agreement found in the textile industry: All Leaves of Absence for 2 weeks or more shall be applied for in writing.
... If an extension of leave is desired, application for the extension shall be made in advance of expiration date.
Extensions of Leaves of Absence shall be for periods of not more than thirty days.
All employees on Leave SENIORITY AND JOB SECURITY 11 of Absence shall report for work on the date of expiration or sooner if the reason for Leave no longer exists.
... In maternity cases the Leave of Absence shall be for not more than nine months, snbject to extension for good cause shown.
. .
. Long-service Employees.
ATany contracts contain provisions granting special protection to long-service employees.
The general provision in such contracts is that the company will make a special efifort, in the event of a lay-off, to find work for employees who have been with the company for a certain lerigth of time.
See the follow- ing provision from an agreement in the automotive industry: Employees having ten years' seniority or more shall have plant-wide sen- iority.
They shall be placed in line with seniority by the Employment De- partment on any job for which they are qualified.
Sometimes long-service employees will retain their seniority during a longer period of lay-off than in the case of other employees.
The following provision is also taken from an agreement in the auto- motive industry: Employees who have been laid off for more than twelve (12) months will lose their seniority excepting those who had five (5) or more years' sen- iority on August 22, 1945.
The latter will lose their seniority when they have been laid off for a period of twenty- four (24) months.
Foremen. Provisions in collective bargaining agreements re- lating to the seniority status of foremen usually state that a fore- man who has been promoted from the position of worker retains his seniority for use in case of demotion.
He may or may not accumulate seniority for the time he has spent as a supervisor.
Absence of such protection makes promotion unattractive to the workers.
An illustration of this provision is found in an agreement in the liquor distillers' industry: If an employee is promoted to a supervisory position outside the bargaining unit but within the plant, he shall be excluded from the coverage of this agreement but shall continue to accumulate departmental, divisional and plant seniority for a period of one year.
In the event he is, within such one year period, returned to his non-supervisory position, he will be credited with all such seniority.
After such one year period he shall accumulate only divisional or plant seniority while working" as a supervisor or outside the bargaining unity.
Unions often try to include a provision that a foreman who has not been promoted from the ranks shall have no seniority.
Manage- ment, on the other hand, argues that it needs to provide work for 12 SENIORITY AND JOB SECURITY Its foremen in slack times so that there will be competent super- visors on hand when more men are needed.
Union Representatives.
In general those w^orkers who are elected to full-time union office keep, and sometimes accumulate, seniority during the time they are serving in that office.
Agree- ments generally provide that shop stewards or committeemen shall have top seniority.
This applies only in the case of lay-offs.
The rea- son for such a provision is that there should be an experienced repre- sentative of the workers in each operating department no matter how much the force may be reduced.
Some unions do not request this clause because it might be resented by the other employees.
Other unions feel it is necessary as a sort of compensation for the often thankless job of shop steward.
This special seniority some- times applies also to certain union officers.
An instance of this provision is seen in a typical agreement in the automotive industry : Xotwithstanding their position on the seniority list, the Plant Shop Com- mittee and the President, \^ice-President, Financial Secretary, Recording Secretary, and Treasurer of the Local Union shall in the event of a lay-off and re-hire be continued at work at all times when one or more departments or fractions thereof are at work, provided that they are able and do the work being done at the time.
Share-the-work Plans.
Most contracts contain provisions for work-sharing even when a seniority system is in effect.
Typically, such clauses provide that probationary and temporary employees shall be dropped before hours are reduced below forty.
Any further curtailment shall be accomplished by reduction of hours until a certain level is reached.
This level varies from 24 to 40 hours.
When this level has been attained there shall be lay-ofTs so that the level of hours may be maintained for the remaining workers.
A typical agreement in the machine manufacturing industry contains such a provision: Should it become necessary to reduce expense because of a depression in business or other causes, the general principle of sharing the work shall be adhered to till the hours fall to forty.
Too much work-sharing has resulted at times in "sharing the misery," and in keeping men tied to part-time jobs when they might be working elsewhere, or receiving unemployment compen- sation.
This is entirely contrary to the principle of work-sharing, which is designed to maintain as many people as possible in slack times.
SENIORITY AND JOB SECURITY 13 It is also apparent that older workers prefer adhering to a seniority plan rather than a work-sharing plan during slack times, while younger workers, with little accumulated seniority, prefer work-sharing.
It is not unusual to find different locals within the same international union having entirely different provisions for distributing the work during slack times, depending on the compo- sition of the membership.
In several industries, notably the building trades and the garment industries, there are no seniority plans in operation.
In the con- struction industry most jobs are too temporary to use a seniority system.
Some system of job rotation is therefore applied as an alternative by most unions in this industry.
In the clothing and garment industries there are at least two sharp seasonal slumps each year.
Under a seniority system there would be continual "bumping" and shifting of jobs.
In these industries, when there is a curtailment of production, all work is shared (through reduction of hours) by all regular employees, regardless of seniority.
This is done so that what income there is can be distributed among all the workers.
A seniority system would leave all but a few out of work entirely for weeks or even months each year.
In other industries, such a drastic work-sharing program might not be expedient, because it woidd prevent workers from securing other employment.
In the clothing and garment industries, where work in all shops is curtailed at al)out the same time, there is little chance to find other work.
Consequences of Seniority Provisions Productive Efficiency.
Management's main objection to sen- iority systems has been that these systems tend to destroy the work- er's incentive to efficient production.
One of the greatest incentives to efficient production before seniority plans were introduced was that the least efficient workers were the first ones to be laid off, while the most efficient workers were retained for as long a time as possible.
It is doubtful, however, that the fear of lay-off provides a good incentive to productive efficiency.
Worry over the possible loss of a job may often reduce efficiency.
Beaumont, in The Psy- chology of Personnel, has pointed out that: It has sometimes been assumed that threatened loss of security -would serve as a strong motivating force, and occasionally employers have thought it advisable to hold over the workers the threat of being fired if their work was 14 SENIORITY AND JOB SECURITY not satisfactory.
Experience has shown, however, that few people operate efficiently under such conditions.
The positive prospect of the reward of security is more powerful than the negative prospect of insecurity as pun- ishment; and workers who can look forward toward regular employment at a satisfactory wage level tend to perform better than those who merely know that they will be discharged if their work does not suit.
The prospect of promotion is likely to be a much better incen- tive than the threat of lay-off.
The application of straight seniority to promotion is, therefore, more likely to have a bad effect on labor efficiency than its application to lay-off.
Sumner Slichter has pointed out ( Union Policies and Industrial Management) that there are some ways in which seniority may improve the productivity of the working force as a whole.
Seniority tends to preserve the efficiency of some of the poor workers by pre- venting the concentration of unemployment among them.
Without seniority, they would be out of work much of the time ; unemploy- ment and turnover would tend to discourage and demoralize them, thus further reducing their efficiency.
The same holds true for older men.
While seniority often keeps them working at jobs that could be done more efficiently by younger men, it is undoubtedly more productive, from the standpoint of the community as a whole, for them to work at the jobs they know best than for them to work at other jobs or to be unemployed.
Lack of Mobility.
Seniority has certain disadvantages to the employees.
A worker usually will prefer staying at a job where he has accumulated seniority and is relatively secure to transferring to a new job.
By transferring he would be low on the seniority list, and the chance of his being laid off would be that much greater.
This possibility may result in a worker's continuing at a job to which he is unsuited, and may also lead to a reluctance on the part of a worker to transfer to a new company or even a new industry.
In such a situation, it is possible also for a company to hold its workers on terms that are relatively unattractive.
Because they have seniority the workers will not want to leave their jobs.
For this reason seniority may be of benefit to management by reducing voluntary quits.
There is a further possible effect of seniority which may be unfortunate for the employee during a lay-off.
Knowing that he is subject to recall by his old company, the worker may hesitate to look for work elsewhere.
He may be unemployed for a long time SENIORITY AND JOB SECURITY 15 without looking for work, because he underestimated the duration of his lay-off.
Moreover, if he does seek another job, other em- ployers may refuse to hire him because he will probably quit as soon as his old job opens up again.
It would be ideal for an individual employee if seniority pro- tection applied in his plant, but not elsewhere.
He would have protection on his present job, but would have no particular difficulty in finding other work if necessary.
The widespread adoption of seniority means that the employee with some length of service has less danger of losing his job, but the consequences of job loss are more serious.
Thus the total gain in security is less than it would appear if considered only in terms of the present job.
Inter-union Friction.
Seniority is sometimes a source of friction between unions.
This is especially true on the railroads, where work is pretty well specialized.
The workers are divided into several unions, all of which have seniority provisions generally similar, but, for the most part, inflexible.
The two unions which are most often in conflict are the Brother- hood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers.
The line of promotion on the railroads runs from fireman to engineer.
Upon promotion a fireman goes on the extra list, and he is likely to alternate between engineer's jobs and fireman's jobs for several years.
He keeps his fireman's seniority while he is accumulating seniority as an engineer.
In the event of a lay-off he can go back to his job as a fireman, and a fireman with less seniority has to make way for him.
This in itself is the cause of conflict between the two unions.
In addition, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and En- ginemen provides several forms of insurance for its members.
The insurance equity increases as long as the member retains his affilia- tion with the Brotherhood.
By the time a worker is promoted from fireman to engineman he probably has a good deal of equity accumu- lated, which he is, of course, reluctant to give up.
* * "Upon promotion, he may, of course, keep his membership in the fireman's organization, and also join the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers.
Many fire- men do that.
Or he may go along with only membership in the fireman's organi- zation, relying on it to handle his grievances and to look after his interests generally, except in the making of agreements which is the prerogative of the engineer brotherhood.
The latter organization, however, may feel justified in bringing pres- sure on him to join, particularly during a time of acute unemployment and declining membership.

16 SENIORITY AND JOB SECURITY Friction within Unions.
Seniority is also a source of friction within the unions.
This is especially true where there are great diversities of age and experience among the members.
Older mem- bers will tend to favor straight seniority provisions ; because they have been working longer, they will naturally receive the greater protection.
Younger workers, on the other hand, will favor plans for sharing the work, at least until the hours are reduced to a certain level.
Otherwise, they will bear the brunt of all the produc- tion curtailment.
Almost every detail of a seniority plan that would be better for some of the members would be worse for others.
Thus there is likely to be more disagreement among the members on the type of seniority than on any other contract provision.
CONCLUSION From the foregoing analysis it is clear that seniority has both advantages and disadvantages to employees, to management, and to the public.
It seems probable that most of the advantages are ob- tained and most of the disadvantages are avoided when some devia- tion from straight seniority is permitted.
Under modified seniority, the employees and unions can obtain protection against discrimina- tion and each employee can know his approximate order of lay-off.
The maintenance of employee efficiency is, of course, to the interest of all concerned — employees, management, and the public ; effi- ciency is unlikely to suffer if an equitable seniority plan is ob- jectively administered.
The very sense of individual security which a sound seniority plan induces among employees may well be a significant factor in promoting increased employee efficiency.
/ I
This policy provides guidelines to agencies for granting paid and/or unpaid leave time to employees who are performing certain civic duties, and to employees who are participating in the formal resolution of workplace conflicts and certain other work-related activities.
Civil and Work-Related Leave is a non-accruing leave type for use under the specific circumstances explained in this policy.
There are two broad categories; paid and unpaid leave related to the employee’s civic duty, and; paid leave related to workplace issues.
Although hourly/wage employees are not covered by this policy and are not eligible to receive paid leave time, agencies are reminded that such employees may be called to jury duty and other civic responsibilities and should be released from work to fulfill those obligations.
Paid Civil Leave shall apply when the employee’s presence at legal proceedings is compelled by subpoena or summons.
Employees may use existing annual, overtime, and/or compensatory leave balances for court proceedings that do not qualify for paid leave, however agencies must provide unpaid leave if requested.
Agencies may limit the paid or unpaid leave provided under this section if the employee's absence creates an undue hardship for the agency.
Annual and Traditional Sick Leave will not accrue in any semi-monthly pay period in which an employee takes unpaid Civil Leave.
To charge absences from work to Civil and Work-Related Leave, employees must submit to their agencies any payments for services rendered.
Failure to submit such payments within a reasonable period of time as determined by the agency will result in the absence being charged to annual, family and personal, compensatory, or overtime leave or, if no leave balances are available, to leave without pay.
they work a portion of the work shift and charge the remainder to annual, family and personal, compensatory, or overtime leave, or to leave without pay.
Employees serving on boards or committees as a required or approved part of their employment with the Commonwealth do not charge the work time to either Civil and Work-Related Leave or accrued leave but treat it as work time.
Such work hours count toward the 40-hour threshold for overtime payment for FLSA non-exempt employees.
The Labour Law of the People’s Republic of China (“Labour Law”) is applicable to all employment relationships between individuals and enterprises in China.
However, local governments of provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities may, and most of them do, issue detailed measures and rules for the implementation of the Labour Law.
Such detailed measures are promulgated based on the Labour Law, with changes and specific details made in light of the local conditions.
Thus, when dealing with China labour or employment matters, reference should always be made to the local regulations (in addition to the Labour Law), particularly as regards social insurance benefits and welfare benefits.
The Labour Law requires the establishment of an employment or labour contract (“Contract”) between the employer and employee for the purposes of recording an employer-employee relationship.
The Contract is required to be made in writing and must necessarily be based on the principles of equality, voluntariness and mutual consent.
If the Contract is not concluded based on such principles or is otherwise in violation of any PRC laws, administrative rules or regulations, the Contract may be treated as invalid in its entirety, or as regards the affected parts only, depending on the seriousness and nature of the violations.
Any dispute over the validity of the Contract or otherwise should in the first instance be referred to the relevant labour dispute arbitration committee (being part of the labour tribunal) for determination, and if the employer or employee concerned does not find the arbitration outcome acceptable, either side may refer the matter to the relevant People’s Court for a judgement to be made.
2. job description or the scope of work to be performed;
Approximately 80% of Finns are members of a trade union.
The International Labour Organisation (ILO) has ranked Finnish unions as amongst the most effective in the world.
In Finland an important function of trade unions is to run unemployment funds and to provide earnings-related unemployment benefits.
These are typically much higher than the basic unemployment allowance provided by KELA (see Social Security ).
Many would argue that this is the primary reason for joining a union, and you should certainly enquire about joining an unemployment fund as soon as you start a new job.
Finnish unions are occupation-based.
There are three main levels: Local trade unions, national federations of member local unions, and confederations which are the peak organisations made up of affiliated federations.
Collective agreements covering the whole of Finland are concluded between the federations.
If you are a member of a union you will almost certainly be working under a collective agreement detailing certain terms and conditions of your employment.
If disagreements arise at the workplace regarding a collective agreement or its interpretation, or if it appears that the agreement may have been broken, dispute resolution usually begins with negotiations at the workplace.
Most collective agreements provide a grievance procedure for the settlement of disputes concerning the application of the agreement in question.
If the matter cannot be solved between the employees and employer, negotiations will then continue between the employer and the shop steward representing the trade union.
Legal labour disputes that do not concern collective agreements can be taken to public courts.
SAK is the oldest employee confederation in Finland, founded in 1907.
It represents more than one million members in 21 affiliated trade unions.
Members are from industry, the public sector, transport and private services.
You cannot really define a "typical" member; local authority childminders, flight attendants, bus drivers, waiters, builders and paper mill employees are all working in sectors organised under the broad SAK umbrella.
Trade union confederation formed by 20 affiliated unions representing approximately 640 000 professional employees.
Members are from the public sector, private industry and the private service sector.
Nearly 70 % of members are women.
Typical member groups include nurses, technical engineers, police officers and secretaries.
Trade union confederation for those with university, professional or other high-level education.
Akava is formed by 34 affiliates, and has about 548 000 members, with 70% unionisation rate.
Members work as experts and educators, for example, and Akava affiliates are also open to all university students and most Polytechnic students.
In Finland it is common to negotiate terms and conditions to be included in the contract, but any such terms must never be below the standard of the terms and conditions already set in the collective agreement negotiated by your union.. If you discover you have accepted terms and conditions worse than those in the collective agreement you can claim compensation.

The three labour confederations in Finland, STTK, FFC and AKAVA have jointly published the introductory guide to the Finnish Trade Union Movement, What Every Employee Should Know.
It contains general information on the Finnish labour union movement as well as the benefits and rights which workers have in Finland.
In Lithuania, with the assistance of socialist intellectuals, the first trade union of shoe makers (sabots) was founded in 1892, much earlier than in other parts of the Russian empire.
It should be noted that the workers' movement in Lithuania was more conscious and more organized than in Russia at that time.
The Jewish workers actively united in the Bund (founded in 1895), a socialist party as well as a union.
In 1896 in Vilnius 21 strikes took place, involving about 500 labour union members.
During May 15 – June 3, 1895 a big shoemakers strike was held.
Three workers were arrested, but were later released as a crowd of 2,000 workers gathered near the place where they were held in custody.
The strikers ran out of money to continue the strike, so they appealed for help to the German shoemakers trade union, which organized a solidarity campaign and collected money to help the Vilnius strikers.
The strike was successful.
The common feature of the trade unions of Lithuania at the beginning of the 20th century was the principle of territorial unification (Vilnius, Klaipeda regional trade unions), according to the national identity (Jewish, Polish, Lithuanian Unions of Workers – Sv.
Juozapo (St. Józef) Workers Union, Sv.
Zitos (St. Zita) maid/servant union), as well as according to the political and religious identity – Social Democratic and Christian Workers Organizations.
In 1908-1909 the tannery workers struck for five months in Vilnius, with demands that are relevant even today.
It was directed against the employers' intention to extend the working day from 8 to 10 hours, reduce wages by 30 percent and to abolish the union's right to monitor workers' hiring and dismissal.
All tanning workers' unions supported the Vilnius trade union from their mutual aid funds.
The outcome of the strike was that the working day was still increased, wages were cut by 20 percent, but the union's rights were not restricted, it continued to monitor recruitment and dismissal.
The union also saved the jobs for the workers.
The employers were trying to bring in strikebreakers (scabs) from Moscow, but the Russian workers who had become aware of this stopped it.
Money for strikers was collected by the Austrian, French and German trade unions.
In 1912 a workers' insurance law passed.
This was also influenced by a petition introduced by the Social-Democratic fraction on behalf of the workers in the Duma (Parliament), signed by 296 people.
In 1912, there were altogether about 700 trade union members in Vilnius.
In 1913 unions of industrial and commercial workers were established with 400 members; and in 1914 a metal workers' local union with 250 members was founded.
After World War I, workers actively joined trade unions in the independent Lithuanian State.
They operated legally until 1931.
Trade union density reached 17% of wage-earners in Lithuania (today: about 11%).
Labour issues were under the responsibility of the Labour and Social Welfare Ministry.
In the first government of independent Lithuania of Mykolas Slezevicius, the labour minister Juozas Paknys (1883 – 1948), was an active trade unionist and a social-democratic leader.
During the years 1919-1929 May Day was an official holiday.
After the declaration of independence a Labour Inspectorate was established, the eight-hours workday introduced in industry (elsewhere, i.e.
in the service sector, the ten-hour day still applied); an employment office was established, a Health Insurance Fund was established by law, and a strict law regulating employment contracts was passed.
In addition, the State protected a number of trade union functions.
Labour law violations were threatened with substantial fines.
A number of employers' organizations were active - the Society of Catholic Businessmen, the Jewish Employers' Union, and others.
Lithuania, as a member of the League of Nations, also joined the International Labour Organisation (ILO), on the basis of its tripartite principle, with employer, trade union and government representatives.
At the annual International Labour Conference the delegation sent by the government was tripartite.
For example, in 1929, the delegation included Telsiai labour inspector Barkauskas representing the government, employers' representative Soloveichik; and worker Kaukorius representing the Lithuanian Labour Federation.
Two main national trade union centers existed in Lithuania between the World Wars: the social-democratic oriented workers and public service trade union center bureau (LPS), and Lithuanian Labour Federation influenced by the Christian-Democrats.
LPS was founded in 1919.
During 1926-27 the LPS union center bureau was led by the prominent Lithuanian labour movement activist Juozas Paplauskas (1896-1946).
Leaders of the Lithuanian Social-Democratic Party (LSDP) actively participated in the trade union movement – LSDP Chairman Steponas Kairys, who signed the Independence Act of February 16, 1918, LSDP members of parliament - V. Pozela, J. Pakalka, K. Venclauskis, A. Purenas, Siauliai city mayor J. Sonda-Sondeckis, also K. Bielinis, J. Paknys.
In 1920 the first congress of Lithuania's trade unions in Independent Lithuania was held, which represented 40,000 organized members (at the time Latvia had 30,000 and Poland - 403,000 union members).
From 1921 onwards, the social-democratic unions began to lose members, as many workers started joining the Lithuanian Labour Federation, which was supported by the Christian-Democratic ruling party.
In 1923 the LPS adopted the principle of branch organization and the communist-oriented wing was expelled.
The Trade Union Center Bureau headquarters were in Kaunas, Kęstučio g. 40 (at the LSDP office premises).
The LPS affiliated to the International Federation of Trade Unions (Amsterdam International) in 1927.
The same year membership was suspended under the regime of Antanas Smetona, who had seized power unconstitutionally in 1926 and established a dictatorship.
Also in 1927 Albert Thomas, Director-General of the International Labour Office, visited Lithuania to investigate the infringement of trade union rights in the country.
He met with the leadership of the pro-regime Lithuanian Labour Federation and the social-democratic LPS leaders, and raised the concern why the activity of the socialist trade unions had been suspended.
However, in 1929 Smetona forbid all LPS activity.
The LPS headquarters also harboured other workers' organizations, all part of the social-democratic labour movement: the workers' sports club "Viltis” (Hope) and the workers self-education society “Kultura” (Culture).
In addition, the LPS cooperated with the social-democratic Workers' Youth “Ziezirba” (Spark) and the Students' Corporation.
“Zaizdras” (Forge).
It also ran a trade union training school and published newspapers: “Profesines Zinios” (Union News) and “Darbininku Zodis” (Workers Word).
The daily “Lietuvos Žinios” (Lithuanian News) was representing trade unions positions.
After the December 1926 coup d’etat, right-wing nationalists came to power, and all trade unions activities were repressed.
In October 1927, the civil servants' union was closed.
Some branches continued to operate until 1932.
In 1927 the Latvian Trade Unions organized massive solidarity protest actions in Riga where they condemned the Lithuanian authorities and an attack on workers rights in Kaunas .
The Lithuanian embassy in Riga was blocked, and its windows broken.
The Lithuanian Foreign Ministry sent a protest note to Latvian Government.
During the right-wing dictatorship, the oppression of workers in Lithuania became general.
On May 15, 1936 in Kaunas a member of Christian workers union, 25 years old worker Antanas Kranauskas, suffering from his employer's arbitrary harassment and from unbearable working conditions, shot Ruvin Kamber, the owner of the sawmill where he worked, and then shot himself.
His funeral became the largest massive demonstration of workers' rights in Lithuania, and triggered the general strike in Kaunas on May 18-19, 1936.
Trade union activity was then totally banned in 1936, and trade union functions were transferred to the Labour and Crafts Chambers.
Only the Catholic Federation of Labour continued to exist and took over the property of the LPS.
After the restoration of independence the LDF was re-established on December 28, 1991.
Before World War II the LDF was an affiliate of the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions and, since 1996, a member of the WCL.
It is now is a member of the ITUC.
The LDF is one of the oldest trade union organizations in the CEE region with consistent continuity.
In 1921 the Vilnius Trade Unions Center Bureau was established, with 15,000 members and 30 organizations, and Novicki as chairman.
He worked closely with the Polish Socialist Party (Polska Partija Socialystycna - PPS).
The Christian unions in Vilnius claimed 16,000 members.
According to the 1921 population statistics, a total of 80,000 workers lived in Vilnius, but in reality the number of employees was about 40,000, since workers were classified together with their family members.
Next to the Center's bureau a youth section was active.
It published the newspaper "Pochodnia” (Torch), which was eventually closed, having fallen under Communist influence.
In 1922 the Vilnius Trade Union Center decided to join the Polish Trade Union Commission (Komisija Krajowa, which in 1921 represented 403,000 members).
In Vilnius, as in all Poland, the trade unions supported the May 14, 1926 Pilsudski coup and the return of J. Pilsudski to power, because he belonged to the PPS.
When the Republic of Poland was established, quite satisfactory labour laws were adopted - 8 hours workday, broader powers for labour inspection, social security, the right to strike, trade union laws.
Some factories, such as the Kalvaria and Vitrum glass factories, also had apartments for workers.
Trade union based on national identity also existed - the Belarusian peasants and workers' organization "Hromada", the Jewish Workers Association (Bund), which published the newspaper "Arbeiter Leben" and had its sports club ‘Maccabi’.
The Vilnius region trade unions were active until 1939.
In 1933 a total of 21 strikes took place, with the participation of 1,704 workers; in 1934 there were 31 strikes, in 5,670 workers participated.
In 1937, a strike in the Vilnius bus company, controlled by the Belgian "Arbon” company, ended with the workers victory.
Also, in 1939 strikes were won in Plywood factory and the Chocolate factory "Viktoria”.
In 1939 when Lithuania regained Vilnius, the Vilnius region trade unions were suppressed.
Polish workers organizations submitted a number of complaints to international organizations regarding lay-offs of civil servants and workers by nationality (all civil servants who lived in the Vilnius region from 1914, had been dismissed from the State and local government services).
In the Klaipėda region, formerly part of the German Empire and since 1923 part of Lithuania, the level of workers' organization was much higher than in most of Lithuania.
German workers were organized in the regional organization of Klaipėda (5 branches), which was an affiliate of the IFTU (Amsterdam International) from 1923 to 1937, and was linked to the German social-democratic trade union center (ADGB).
Its official name was: Gewerkschaftsbund des Memelgebietes.
After the annexation of the Klaipėda region by Nazi Germany (1939 – 1944) the unions were dissolved and replaced by the Nazis labour organization Deutsche Arbeitsfront (DAF).
In 1944, the Soviet Union re-occupied Lithuania including Klaipėda.
Trade Union Activity During the Soviet Period
In 1940, free trade unions were re-established shortly in Lithuania, but were quickly taken over by the Soviets and united with the Soviet Trade Unions.
In the June 23, 1941 uprising against the Red Army the workers' organizations members were actively involved.
Free trade union representatives participated in the activities of the Lithuanian Liberation Committee (VLIK), a resistance organization.
After the war a number of trade union activists were deported to Siberia, or went into exile in the West.
Many Lithuanian representatives of the Free Labour Movement who had suffered before from the Smetona regime were now repressed by Stalin's regime.
In the West a Free Lithuanian Trade Union Group was established.
It participated in the free trade unions' activities and represented Lithuania in their conferences.
Trade unions in exile were sending representatives to various global events, i.e.
even represented Lithuania at the 1949 founding congress of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions in London.
After the incorporation of Lithuania into the USSR, trade unions were organized under the Soviet model and became part of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions (VCSPS).
In Lithuania in 1980 it represented 20 branches and 1,735 million members.
The trade union activities during the Soviet period are widely described in the publications of that time.
Rejecting ideological templates, it is possible to imagine an overall picture of the state of the organizations, their functions and their nature.
Trade Unions After the Restoration of Independence.
In the beginning of the national liberation movement, next to 'Sajudis', the club "Labora" was founded, which generated trade union renewal ideas.
In 1989 it launched the trade union renewal movement (A. Januška, R. Dagys, D. Paukstė, etc.).
The same year, as an alternative to the Soviet trade unions, the Lithuania Workers' Union was established.
Its first president was Kazimieras Uoka.
The cooperation with All Unions Central Council collapsed, some manufacturing branches left the Soviet branch unions.
On April 19-21, 1990 the first Lithuania's trade union congress took place, where the Lithuanian Confederation of Free Trade Unions was founded and became the legal successor of the LSSR Council of Trade Unions.
One of first decision was to leave the Soviet Trade Union umbrella organization VCSPS L. Radzevicius was elected president, then from the residue of the organization the new Lithuanian trade union center was established.
Some of the trade union branches and organizations were dissatisfied with the slow reform and the "Soviet" past and did not join this organization, but in February 1992 founded another organization - the Lithuanian Trade Union Unification (LPSS), which elected Algirdas Sysas as chairman.
The LPSS cooperated closely with the re-established LSDP (social democratic party).
In 2002, the Lithuanian trade union center, led by Juozas Olekas, and the Lithuanian Trade Union Unification merged into the largest organization of Lithuania - the Lithuanian Trade Union Confederation (LPSK).
Also in 2002 the Lithuanian Workers' Union changed its name and became the Lithuanian Trade Union "Solidarumas".
The internal struggle for the former USSR trade union assets was very damaging for the for modern Lithuanian trade union movement.
It was caused by inconsistent decisions of Parliament and governments on the asset usage and redistribution, and by the influence of various financial and business groups.
Trade union representatives participated actively in the Independent State recovery work.
A number of independent Lithuania trade union activists have become members of Parliament and of the Government - A. Sysas, R. Dovudeniene-Zakaitiene (Minister of Culture 2001-2004 and Minister of Education 2004-2008), D. Paukste, J. Olekas (Minister of Health Care 2001-2004 and Minister of Defence 2004-2008) K. Kuzminskas, J. Beinortas, G. Paliokienė, P.Sakalinis, O. Baboniene, A. Januska , R. Hofertiene and others.
Giedrius Asmys was elected mayor of Kaunas.
Most of the legislative amendments regarding labour issues and social affairs were adopted with the trade union support.
Currently, Lithuania has three recognized national trade union centers - LPSK (Chairman A. Cerniauskas), the LBS "Solidarumas" (Chairwoman A. Jasinskiene) and LDF (chairman V. Puskepalis), which cooperate on the basis of an agreement and are the members of National Tripartite Council, established in 1995.
Trade union activities are based on principles of social partnership.
A number of regional trade unions did not join national unions.
Trade unions density in Lithuania is among the lowest in the EU – 10-11% of total employment.
One of reasons is economic migration.
The Irish trade union SIPTU, and Fellesforbundet in Norway have set up branches for Lithuanian workers.
In independent Lithuania entirely new organizations have developed, such as unions of the police, firemen, customs officers, tax inspectors, officials of the Seimas (Parliament) and of the Prosecutor's Office, investigators (detectives), banking and insurance, casinos, private security, gas stations, state security workers.
Lithuania’s largest professional trade union is the Education Workers Trade Union, and the largest primary organization is the AB Mazeikiu Nafta (oil refinery) trade union.
Lithuanian trade unions cooperate closely with those of the other Baltic countries, and the unions of the Nordic Countries, the United States, Poland, Russia, Georgia, Belarus and Ukraine.
A Baltic Council of Trade Unions was established for the sub-regional coordination of activities.
Since independence, Lithuanian unions have received a significant financial and methodological support from the international trade union movement – for the activities in the market conditions and increase of membership.
Currently, the newspapers “Lietuvos profsajungos” (Lithuanian Trade Unions), “Solidarumas", a number of branch and regional publications are published, a number of trade unions websites (www.lprofsajungos.lt and others) exist.
Since Independence, due to a lack of resources and incomplete laws, only few strikes were organized: warning strikes of the public transport workers, teachers and healthcare workers, the hunger strike at Kaunas factory "Koordinate".
The decline in numbers spotlights the vital need for good industrial relations within the industry, the ILO says.
Such issues as freedom of association and the right to organize and collective bargaining assume greater importance as they are an often-used argument for restricting the right to strike in the oil and gas industries when they are deemed essential services.
The news is not all bad, however, according to Yasuhiko Kamakura, an ILO expert in the oil and gas sector.
"These industries are strategic and have special working conditions," he says.
"Typical earnings worldwide are reported to be higher on average than those for any other industry and working hours tend to be shorter and more flexible.
"
Occupational safety and health also has generally improved.
According to CONCAWE, the oil companies' European organization for the environment, the number of injuries per one million hours worked was 4.3 in 1999, slightly down on the average of the past four years.
Figures from the American Petroleum Institute (API) show that the number of work-related injuries per 100 workers fell from 1.95 in 1997 to 1.34 in 1998.
The bad news, according to the ILO report, is that governments in several oil- and gas-producing countries have imposed restrictions on freedom of association.
Most of the cases reported concerned limitations of the right to strike.
Following the comments of the ILO's Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, the Government of Norway amended its legislation and removed restrictions on the right to strike in the oil industry.
The Committee had explicitly judged the petroleum sector not to constitute an essential service, like hospitals, electricity, water supply, telephones and air traffic control.
Basic issues affecting trade union rights in Nigeria remained unchanged, the report found.
Between 1998 and 2001, the ILO Committee of Experts noted a number of complaints regarding violations of workers' basic rights presented against the Government.
According to complainants, the Nigerian Trade Union Act did not allow workers to form and join the union of their own choosing but obliged them to join the union specified by law.
The Act, by setting at 50 the number of workers required to form a trade union, was obviously intended to prevent workers from organizing their own unions, the report said.
Art.
88 of the Venezuelan Constitution [1] states that “the law shall adopt measures intended to guarantee stability of labour and shall establish the benefits to compensate for seniority of service of a worker and protect him in case of unemployment”.
The primary source relating to labour is the Basic Labour Act (BLA) of 27 November 1990.
[2] Collective agreements are another source of law which often encompass termination of employment, making particular reference to dismissal for invalid reasons, procedures and benefits.
In practice, tripartite commissions established through agreements place high priority on problems linked to dismissal.
The case law of labour courts and decisions of the labour inspectorate (and decisions to settle legal disputes) supplement these sources of regulation, particularly in the area of immunities.
Apprentices, young persons, domestic workers, caretakers, home workers, professional sports people, rural workers, persons employed in land, air and inland water transport, seafarers, motorized workers, actors, musicians, folklorists and other intellectual and cultural workers and disabled persons are covered by special conditions (Title V, Special Conditions, BLA).
Resignation is the unilateral termination of the employment relationship by the worker.
The BLA does not impose an obligation on the worker to submit written notice of resignation stating the reason, if any, for such action.
Indeed, the BLA provides for termination of employment by the worker without reason and requires only the submission of notice ranging from seven to 30 days, depending on the worker’s length of service (after a month, seven days; after six months, 15 days; and after one year, 30 days).
In lieu of notice, in the case of contracts of indeterminate duration, the worker must indemnify the employer by payment of a sum corresponding to the wages he or she would have earned during the notice period (sec.
107, BLA).
In the case of contracts for a specified period or task, the judge may order a worker to pay as compensation for damages an amount which must not exceed one-half of the remuneration which would have been due up to the completion of the task or service (sec.
110, BLA).
Dismissal is indirect when an employer who wishes to terminate employment uses indirect means to induce the worker to resign, and gives cause for justified resignation.
Indirect dismissal is also considered by law to cover the following cases (sec.
103(1), BLA):
According to Venezuelan law, dismissal is the manifestation of the employer’s desire to end the employment relationship (sec.
99, BLA).
Dismissal is unjustified when the worker has committed no action to justify it.
Such justification must be claimed within 30 consecutive days after the date on which the worker is informed, or should have been informed, of the facts constituting grounds for the unilateral termination of employment by the employer (sec.
101, BLA).
This also applies to reasons relating to the operational requirements of the undertaking such as collective dismissal and staff reduction without prior notification.
Mass dismissal is classified as the loss of employment by 10 per cent of the workers in an enterprise employing more than 100 persons, 20 per cent of more than 50 workers, or ten workers in an undertaking employing fewer than 50 workers, within a period of three months (sec.
34, BLA).
Venezuelan law provides that certain workers, for various reasons, are irremovable and may not be dismissed, transferred or employed in less favourable working conditions without just cause approved in advance by the labour inspector (sec.
449, BLA).
This protection is, generally, reserved for trade union promoters and board members, promoters of collective agreements and workers involved in collective disputes against employers, but has also been extended to other categories of persons, whether or not they are linked to trade union activity or collective relations.
The following may therefore enjoy protection under the BLA:
board members of a trade union, during their management and up to three months after the expiry of the term for which they were elected (sec.
451);
the trade union delegate aboard a ship flying the Venezuelan flag (sec.
356);
workers during trade union elections, from the notice of convocation until the election itself, a period which should not exceed three months within a period of two years (sec.
452);
workers affected by a draft collective agreement, during the period of negotiations and up to 180 days, which may be extended by 90 days in exceptional circumstances (secs.
458 and 520);
workers who accept changes in working conditions for economic reasons which jeopardize the work or existence of the enterprise, during the period the agreement is in force (secs.
525 and 526);
The Ministry of Labour may suspend collective dismissals, for social reasons, by a special ruling and submit the dispute to arbitration if the parties cannot reach an agreement, or if reasons of an economic, technological or structural nature are invoked (sec.
34, BLA).
The trade union to which the workers belong or, in the absence of a trade union, the workers themselves must be notified of the employer’s application.
There are no express provisions for compensation in this case.
The worker is entitled to a period of notice, as follows (sec 104, BLA):
Legislation (sec.
453, BLA) lays down an administrative procedure for requests submitted by the employer to dismiss, transfer or justifiably lower the working conditions of the worker enjoying trade union immunity.
Similarly, a statutory provision provides (sec.
454, BLA) for these workers the procedure of reinstatement (reenganche) in the event that the employer may have dismissed, transferred or lowered the working conditions of a worker without fulfilling the above-mentioned requirements.
In accordance with the 1997 revision of the law, the worker has the right to a seniority bonus that accrues interest and that is to be paid monthly or upon termination of the employment relationship at the worker’s initiative (sec.
108, BLA).
This is the equivalent of:
When the employment relationship ends, the worker has a right to a seniority benefit, up to 75 per cent of which can be payable in advance.
The amount is:
Bankruptcy is one of the hypothetical reasons for the termination of employment and in such cases the rights derived from the relationship of employment are preferential.
Payments to workers are handled independently of bankruptcy proceedings by creditors.
The amount of compensation varies depending on whether the bankruptcy was fraudulent or fortuitous.
If bankruptcy is deemed to be caused by third parties or through negligence, the worker has the right to double compensation, whereas if bankruptcy has resulted from unforeseen or inevitable events it is considered fortuitous.
Appeals against the verdict may be lodged with the Higher Labour Tribunal which will decide on the substance of the dispute and confirm or reject the plea for reinstatement and payment of forfeited wages.
No appeal is allowed to the court of cassation against a decision of this Tribunal (secs.
121, 122 and 123, BLA).
[4] Basic Act on prevention, working conditions and the working environment.
One of the greatest innovations that took place in vocational training during the last few years has been its progressive connection with the world of work and, therefore, the systems of labour relations.
Traditionally, Latin America witnessed the implementation of models - regardless of the variations and nuances of concrete national experiences - which gave public institutions the responsibility of training human resources for the thriving industry of the 1940s and 1950s.
In most cases, the incipient institutionality of the processes required the participation of workers' and employers' organisations to manage such bodies (tripartism).
Simultaneously, collective bargaining at the enterprise level or according to the activity sector dealt with the impact that training could have in wages and employment promotion policies.
In addition to these processes, the issue of vocational training was also tackled by Ministries of Labour (Labour management and vocational training) since training has turned into an active employment policy, probably the most important one.
Some employment plans implemented by many ministries had a fundamental training component, or, at least, they included some sort of participation of such bodies in the direction of actions, that were managed and executed by social partners or by a wide range of actors belonging to the labour and training world.
ETUC and the European Convention .
Resolution adopted by the 10th Congress of the European Trade Unions Confederation, 2003, expressing ETUC's concern about the lack of: a clear and committed decision to integrate the Charter of Fundamental Rights with full legal effects into the Constitution; a proper consideration for the place and mission of Services of General Interest with a legal basis to act on them at EU level; a proper consideration for the place of Services of General Interest or a positive response to the need to establish the tools for economic governance at European level; a full integration of the gender dimension; a positive response to the need to establish the tools for economic governance at European level to effectively pursue sustainable
Section 68 of the Constitution stipulates that all international agreements, which settle matters that may be decided by the legislative process, require ratification by the Saeima.
In accordance with Section 89 of the Satversme, the State has a duty to recognise and protect fundamental human rights laid down in the Constitution, the laws and international agreements, which are binding upon Latvia.
Section 13 of the Law on International Treaties of the Republic of Latvia stipulates that where International agreements approved by the Saeima contain different provisions from those contained in national legislation, the former shall apply.
Almost identical wording is enshrined in the Labour Law.
Thus, it is derived from the Constitution and other legislative acts that international law principles prevail over national rules (except the Satversme).
However, the enforcement procedures of international law may be different depending on the relevant situation.
In practice, the awareness of the courts as to the application of international rules is steadily growing.
As a confirmation of this, two comparatively recent cases came before the court where international agreements were applied directly by the court in the area of gender discrimination and equal pay.
Chapter VIII of the Constitution, which lays down the fundamental rights and freedoms of Latvian citizens, contains certain provisions on labour rights, such as the prohibition of discrimination (Section 91), the freedom of association (Section 102), the right to remuneration (and minimum wage) and the right to weekly holidays and annual paid leave (Section 107), and finally the right to conclude collective agreements, the right to strike and the freedom of trade unions (Section 108).
Latvia joined the European Union on 1st May 2004.
Membership in the EU requires that the country complies with the "acquis communautaire" (already existing Community law), that it implements ("transposes") any Directives and Regulations not already incorporated into national law, that it transposes any future Directives into national law within the specified time period, and that it abides by future Regulations.
European Community Law (EC Law) is binding not only on the State but it also has direct effects on individuals, who can invoke it before the national courts.
In addition , national courts can and must submit cases before the European Court of Justice (ECJ) for a preliminary ruling under article 234 EC when they consider that national law or regulations deviate from EC law.
In case the ECJ takes the view that a national law or regulation (including a collective agreement or even a practice) is in breach of EC Law, then it shall instruct the national court to set aside the national rule so that it can give a judgment in light of EC Law only.
EC Law is composed of primary law (the EC Treaty and the EU Treaty) , and secondary law (Directives, Regulations, Decisions etc).
While regulations are binding and applicable in all Member States without further national legislation directives are binding as to the result to be achieved, upon each Member State to which they are addressed, but shall leave to the national authorities the choice of form and methods.
(Art. 249 EC).
In practice Member States adopt legislation with a view to transposing a directive into the national law though in some cases a directive may be implemented by other means, and more especially by collective agreement, which is expressly envisaged under article 137.4 EC.
The Republic of Latvia acquired its independence in 1918.
During the period of independence until 1940, labour legal relations were partly covered by Tsarist Russia legal acts (in the area of Civil law and industrial work).
Labour law was also covered by legal acts adopted by the Saeima and Cabinet of Ministers of the independent Republic of Latvia.
These acts regulated working time organization, social insurance, right to organize and collective bargaining issues, etc.
In order to ensure proper implementation of the above-mentioned legal acts, the Law on State Labour Inspectorate was also adopted in 1939.
During the period of occupation of Latvia by the Soviet Union (1940-1990) as well as by Germany (during the WWII), the legal labour relations system of the Soviet Union and Germany was applicable in Latvia respectively.
The former also included the Labour Code adopted in 1972 (which was replaced by the new Labour Law in force since 1 June 2002).
In the 1990's, after Latvia regained its independence, a labour law reform was launched in order to replace the Soviet system.
The major part of this reform included the implementation of the rules stemming from international law, in particular European Union law.
As a result of the reform, legislation in the area of labour law encompasses both individual and collective labour relations.
As a part of the reform, the following legal acts were adopted:
the Labour Law (effective since 1 June 2002, amended on 12 December 2002);
A large proportion of the reform also lays in the establishment of a national consultation mechanism between social partners – the National Tripartite Co-operation Council (hereafter referred to as the NTCC).
The main task of the NTCC is to ensure and promote co-operation of the Government, employers' organizations and employees' organizations at the national level with the objective to ensure solutions of social and economic development problems, which are acceptable to all social partners.
Thus, social partners have an increased responsibility in the adopted decisions.
All legislative acts as regards national policy in the social sphere are prepared in close collaboration with the social partners (for example, the Labour Law, the Labour Protection Law, the Labour Disputes Law, etc.
).
Apart from legislative acts as sources of Labour Law, the role of other forms of labour regulation has always been of major importance.
However, Latvia belongs to the Roman-German legal system that is characterised by strict laws and rules as sources of law.
Therefore laws and regulations in Latvia are primary sources of law (including the Labour Law) and soft law in general is used only as an auxiliary for the correct interpretation and application of the primary source.
The government of Latvia does not use in practice such administrative regulations that could serve as a source of Labour Law.
The role of collective agreements is constantly growing as a local source of law in establishing the content of labour legal relations.
This may be particularly observed in the new Labour Law providing that such issues, as organization of work remuneration, labour protection and social security shall be included in collective agreements.
Therefore collective agreements may be considered as sources of labour regulation to the extent to which these agreements express a common accord of both parties and as far as the issues covered by them are delegated by law.
However, provisions of collective agreements may not be contrary to those contained in the law.
Arbitration awards, like collective agreements, may be local sources of law in respect of persons involved in a dispute.
The Labour Disputes Law provides that collective labour rights dispute parties may agree to settle the dispute in arbitrage.
The law also stipulates that if the accord is not reached in a conciliation committee in respect of collective interest dispute, it shall be settled in accordance with the procedure set out in the collective agreement.
If there is no such procedure in the collective agreement, the dispute shall be settled by reconciliation method or in arbitrage.
The performance of the decision taken in arbitrage shall be voluntary.
If such decision is not performed each party shall have the right to collective action.
However, if parties reach a written concurrence on the fulfilment of such decision, it shall have a power of collective agreement.
An employer and an employee establish an employment legal relationship by a contract of employment.
By means of a contract of employment an employee undertakes to perform specific work, subject to specified working procedures and orders of an employer, while the employer undertakes to pay the agreed work remuneration and to ensure fair and safe working conditions that are not harmful to health.
A contract of employment shall be entered into in writing.
If written form has not been complied with, an employee has the right to request that the contract of employment be expressed in writing.
In order to afford additional protection to an employee, the Labour Law also provides that where an employee and an employer, or at least one of the parties, has begun to perform the duties contracted for, a contract of employment that does not conform to the written form shall have the same legal effect as a contract of employment expressed in writing (Section 41 of the Labour Law).
As a general rule, contracts of employment are concluded for an unspecified period of time (Section 43 of the Labour Law).
Fixed-term contracts are only admitted in a restricted number of cases, defined in Section 44.
This was one of the major changes included in the new Labour Law, harmonizing Latvian Law with Directive 1999/70/EC on fixed-term work.
Fixed-term employment contracts are permitted in the cases of seasonal work, work in activity areas where a contract of employment is normally not entered into for an unspecified period, replacement of an employee who is absent, casual work which is normally not performed in the company, emergency work in order to prevent the consequences caused by an unexpected event, etc.
Fixed-term contracts may also be concluded in special areas such as sports, etc.
Where a contract of employment does not indicate the period for which it has been entered into, or if according to the circumstances the entering into a contract of employment for a specified period is not permissible, the contract of employment shall be deemed as entered into for an unspecified period (Section 44 (5), Labour Law).
With a view to eradicating differential treatment, the Labour Law provides that the same provisions which apply to an employee with whom a contract of employment has been entered into for an unspecified period shall apply to an employee who has concluded a fixed-term contract of employment.
Parties to a contract of employment, concluded either for a fixed period or an indefinite period, can agree upon a probationary period (Section 46 and following of the Labour Law).
The maximum length of a probationary period is three months.
A probation period shall not be determined for persons under 18 years of age.
Where the contracted term of a probation period has expired and the employee continues to perform the work, it is considered that he or she has passed the probation period (Section 47 (2) of the Labour Law).
Section 84 of the Labour Law provides for a possibility to conclude a non-competition clause.
In accordance with these provisions an employee may accept the obligation that, for a certain period after the termination of his or her employment, which however must not exceed two years, he or she will not be engaged in a business activity of competitive nature in respect of his or her former employer.
Such activity must then be performed neither for another employer nor as self-employment.
A non-competition clause can be agreed upon under circumstances where there is justification for such arrangement.
The employer must pay the employee adequate compensation during the period covered by the agreement.
An employee can be suspended from work in situations defined in Section 58 of the Labour Law, for example if the employee is under the influence of alcohol or narcotic substances.
In order to protect employee's earnings during suspension the Labour Law provides that an employer has a duty to pay an employee the average earnings for the whole period of forced absence from work, as well as to compensate for losses caused as a result of the suspension, if the suspension of an employee from work has been unfounded due to the fault of the employer.
Parents (guardians) or the State Labour Inspection have the right to request in writing the termination of an employment relationship with a person who is under 18 years of age if such person performs work, which jeopardises his or her safety, health or morals or negatively affects his or her development or education.
Pursuant to Section 101 of the Labour Law, an employer has the right to give a written notice of termination of a contract of employment only on the basis of circumstances related to the conduct of the employee, his or her abilities, or of economic, organizational, technological measures or measures of a similar nature in the undertaking only in the following cases:
On an exceptional basis, an employer has the right to bring an action for termination of employment legal relationships in court in cases not referred to above if he or she has good cause.
Any condition that does not allow the continuation of employment legal relationships on the basis of considerations of morality and fairness shall be regarded as such good cause.
The issue whether there is good cause shall be settled by court at its discretion.
An employee can also terminate a contract of employment.
He or she has a duty to give a notice in writing one month in advance, unless a shorter time limit for the giving of a notice of termination is provided by the contract of employment or the collective agreement.
By agreement of an employee and his or her employer, a contract of employment may be terminated also before expiry of the time period for a notice of termination.
These provisions do not apply if the employee has good cause, based on considerations of morality or fairness.
If an employee terminates the contract of employment based on such good cause he or she is entitled to severance pay.
Prior notice is required to terminate a contract of employment concluded for an indefinite period as well as a fixed-term contract where an employer intends to terminate such contract before the expiry of the term.
An employer, when giving a notice of termination of a contract of employment, shall comply with different time periods, depending on the grounds of dismissal.
The notice of dismissal will take effect either immediately, or 10 days after the notice, or one month after the notice, accordingly to Sections 103 and 101 of the Labour Law.
However, the period of time for prior notice can be longer if it is provided so in the collective agreement or the contract of employment.
In the event of temporary incapacity of an employee the period of such incapacity shall not be included in the time limit of a notice of termination, if the employee requests so.
An employer has to observe special requirements if he or she intends to terminate the contract of employment with workers' representatives.
Prior to giving a notice of termination, an employer has a duty to ascertain whether an employee is a member of an employee trade union (Section 101(6) of the Labour Law).
An employer is prohibited from giving a notice of termination of a contract of employment to an employee who is a member of a trade union without prior consent of the relevant trade union.
Exceptions to this prohibition are the notice during probationary time as well as situations when an employer terminates contract on one of the following grounds: an employee, when performing work, is under the influence of alcohol, narcotic or toxic substances, an employee who previously performed the relevant work has been reinstated at work or the employer – legal person or partnership – is being liquidated (Section 110 of the Labour Law).
According to Section 20(4) of the Labour Protection Law for trusties (i.e.
workers' representatives in the field of labour protection) an employer, before issuing a notice of termination, must first receive prior consent of the State Labour Inspectorate.
Moreover, an employer does not have the right to give a notice of termination of a contract of employment during a period of temporary incapacity of an employee, during a period when an employee is on leave or is not performing the work due to other justifiable reasons (Section 109, Labour Law).
In all cases when giving a notice of termination, an employer has a duty to notify an employee in writing those circumstances that serve a basis for the notice of termination of the contract of employment.
The Labour Law stipulates that where a collective agreement or the contract of employment does not specify a larger redundancy benefit, when terminating a contract of employment on the basis of circumstances related to the employees abilities or of economic, organizational, technological measures or measures of a similar nature in the undertaking an employer has a duty to pay a redundancy benefit to an employee in the following amounts: (1) one month average earnings if the employee has been employed by the relevant employer for less than five years, (2) two months average earnings if the employee has been employed by the relevant employer for five to 10 years, (3) three months average earnings if the employee has been employed by the relevant employer for 10 to 20 years and (4) four months average earnings if the employee has been employed by the relevant employer for more than 20 years.
During a probationary period both parties can terminate the employment relationship giving prior notice in written three days before termination.
An employer as well as an employee, when giving the notice of termination of a contract of employment during a probation period, does not have to indicate the cause for such notice (Section 47(1) of the Labour Law).
An employee has no protection against unfair dismissal during probationary period.
However, an employee has the right to request appropriate compensation, if an employer has violated the prohibition of differential treatment when terminating the contract of employment during probationary period (Section 48 of the Labour Law).
Section 105 and the following of the labour Law include provisions regulating collective dismissals.
A collective dismissal is defined as the following number of terminations of employment relationships during a period of 30 days:
Where an employer contemplates collective redundancies, he or she is required to begin consultations with employee representatives in good time before serving notices of dismissal.
These consultations are designed to arriving at an agreement on measures to avoid or to reduce adverse consequences of collective dismissals and to mitigate their social impact.
Above all, ways and means should be sought for transferring the employees concerned to other employers' workplaces and/or finding them new suitable employment.
According to Section 122 of the Labour Law, an employee may bring an action for the invalidation of a notice of dismissal, or for reinstatement, in a period of one month following the notice.
Where a notice of termination made by an employer has no legal basis or the procedures prescribed for termination of a contract of employment have been violated, such notice in accordance with a court judgment shall be declared invalid.
In such a case an employee can, in accordance with a court judgment, be reinstated in his or her previous work (Section 124 of the Labour Law).
Pursuant to Section 126 of the Labour Law, an employee who has been dismissed illegally and reinstated in his or her previous work is entitled to average earnings for the whole period of forced absence from work.
Compensation for the whole period of forced absence from work shall also be paid in cases where a court, although there exists a basis for the reinstatement of an employee in his or her previous work, at the request of the employee terminates employment legal relationships by a court judgment.
The employer has the burden of proof in cases of dismissal, e.g.
the employer has a duty to prove that a notice of termination of a contract of employment has a legal basis and complies with the specified procedure for termination of a contract of employment.
In other cases when an employee has brought an action in court for the reinstatement in work, the employer has a duty to prove that, when dismissing the employee, he or she has not violated the right of the employee to continue employment legal relationships (Section 125 of the Labour Law).
The Labour Law contains a separate part (Chapters 31-35) regulating working time, rest time and their organization.
Sources of law containing provisions concerning working time are both statutory enactments (legislative acts and regulations of the Cabinet of Ministers) and local acts (collective agreements, working procedure regulations and contracts of employment).
Although the Labour Law renders detailed elaboration of working time issues, an emphasis is put on the awareness of the parties to collective agreements or a contract of employment of particular situations.
It is presumed that parties are in a better position to lay down working time regulations for themselves, provided the protection of workers set out in the law is ensured.
The definition of working time laid down in Section130 (1) of the Labour Law, stipulates that working time is a period from the beginning until the end of work within the scope of which an employee performs work or is at the disposal of an employer, with the exception of breaks in work.
This perception of working time is identical to that of actual work performance, excluding any interruptions of work, such as breaks and periods of absence, for which remuneration is not paid.
Exceptions to this principle are (1) additional breaks granted to employees who are exposed to a special risk, which shall be included as working time (Section 145 (6) of the Labour Law) and (2) additional breaks for feeding a child granted to an employee who has a child under one and a half years of age.
In these cases, the worker is entitled to his or her average earnings (Section 146 (4) of the Labour Law).
For employees who, on the basis of the order of an employer, concurrently are acquiring an occupation (profession, trade), the time spent on studies and work shall be summed and shall be regarded as working time (Section 137 (2) of the Labour Law).
There are three types of working time provided for in the Labour Law: (1) regular working time, (2) part-time work and (3) normal shortened working time.
In Latvia regular working time is the general rule and part-time or normal shortened working time are exceptions.
In accordance with Section 131 of the Labour Law, regular daily working time of an employee - the working time within a 24-hour period - may not exceed eight hours.
Regular weekly working time may not exceed 40 hours.
Where, however, daily working time on any weekday is less than the regular daily working time, the regular working time of some other weekday may be extended, but not more than by one hour.
In such case provisions of the length of weekly working time shall be complied with.
A regular working week consists of five days.
If due to the nature of work it is not possible to determine a working week of five days, an employer, after consultation with employee representatives, has the right to specify a working week of six days (Section 133 (1) of the Labour Law).
In such occasions the length of daily working time shall not exceed seven hours and work on Saturdays shall be ended earlier than on other days.
The length of the working day on Saturdays is specified by a collective agreement, working procedure regulations, or by a contract of employment.
Pursuant to Section 135 of the Labour Law, the length of the working day before holidays shall be reduced at least by one hour.
Like on Saturdays, it is preferable that the length of working time of such days is specified by a collective work agreement, working procedure regulations, or a contract of employment.
The regular working time of a night employee shall also be reduced by at least one hour unless particular characteristics of an undertaking do not allow for it.
Regular working time of employees exposed to special risk may not exceed seven hours a day and 35 hours a week provided they are engaged in such work for not less than 50 per cent of the regular daily or weekly working time (Section 131 (3) of the Labour Law).
Section 132 (1) of the Labour Law provides that all persons under 18 years of age enjoy a working week of five days.
If they, in addition to work, continue to acquire primary, secondary or an occupational education, the time spent on studies and work is summed and may not exceed seven hours a day and 35 hours a week.
Moreover, where persons under 18 years of age are employed by several employers, the working time shall be summed and shall not exceed the time limit specified above.
From the point of view of the amount of working time allowed, persons under 18 years of age are divided into two categories: children (i.e.
persons between 13 and 15 years of age or those who until reaching the age of 18 continue to acquire basic education) and adolescents (i.e.
persons 15-18 years of age except those who until reaching the age of 18 continue to acquire basic education).
Pursuant to Section 132 (2) and (3) of the Labour Law, children who have reached the age of 13 may not be employed either for more than two hours a day and more than 10 hours a week if the work is performed during the school year or for more than 4 hours a day and more than 20 hours a week if the work is performed during a period when there are holidays at educational institutions.
Adolescents, on the other hand, may not be employed for more than seven hours a day and more than 35 hours a week.
An important principle focusing on equal treatment of full-time employees and part-time employees is enshrined in Section 134 (2) of the Labour Law stating that the rules, which apply to full-time employees, shall apply equally to part-time employees.
Section 134 (1) of the Labour Law provides for the freedom of the parties to agree on part-time work in the contract of employment.
Part-time work is understood as any working time, which is shorter than the regular daily or weekly working time.
At the same time it has to be noted that employers themselves possess the right to request the transfer of an employee from regular working time to part-time or vice versa (Section 134 (4) of the Labour Law).
But a refusal by an employee to change over from regular working time to part-time or vice versa may not of itself serve as a basis for a notice of termination of a contract of employment or restriction of the rights of an employee in any other way.
Overtime is an exception to the maximum duration of regular working time.
Work exceeding the daily working time of 8 hours is considered to be overtime.
It is interpreted restrictively and, for instance, where the duration of working time is reduced by agreement, overtime is still computed only after 8 hours of work.
The limit of allowed overtime hours is laid down in Section 136 (5) of the Labour Law stipulating that overtime work may not exceed 48 hours within a four-week period and 200 hours within a calendar year.
Moreover, overtime work is considered as both (1) the work in case of aggregated working time, performed by an employee beyond 56 hours a week and 160 hours within a four-week period as well as (2) the time worked by an employee after the end of a shift.
Overtime work is permitted if the employee and the employer have agreed upon that in writing.
However, in certain exceptional circumstances an employer has the right to employ an employee on overtime without his or her written consent.
The exhaustive enumeration of the exceptional circumstances include (1) the most urgent public need, (2) prevention of consequences caused by force majeure , an unexpected event or other exceptional circumstances which has adversely affected or may affect the normal course of work activities in the undertaking, and (3) the completion of urgent, unexpected work within a specified period of time.
If the overtime work in the above-mentioned exceptional cases continues for more than six consecutive days, save when repetition of similar work is not expected, the employer has to obtain a permit from the State Labour Inspection for further overtime work.
In accordance with Section 69 of the Labour Law, an employee who performs overtime work is entitled to a supplement of not less than 100 per cent of the hourly or daily wage rate specified for him or her, but if piece-work pay has been agreed upon, a supplement of not less than 100 per cent of the piece-work rate for the amount of work done.
A collective agreement or a contract of employment may specify a higher supplement for overtime work.
Following the conception enshrined in the Labour Law, night work is considered to be any work performed in the period of time from 10pm to 6am for more than two hours.
In respect of children, night work means any work performed for more than two hours in the period of time from 8pm to 6am (Section 138 (1) of the Labour Law).
A night-employee is an employee who normally performs night work either in accordance with a shift schedule, or for at least 50 days in a calendar year.
There is a specific regulation of night work provided for by the Labour Law.
Firstly, working time for night employees, apart from those who have been prescribed regular shortened working time, has to be reduced by one hour.
However, if there is an urgent need and it is required by the particular characteristics of the undertaking, regular daily working time for a night employee can be 8 hours.
Secondly, a night employee has the right to undergo a health examination before he or she is employed at night, as well as the right to undergo regular health examinations not less frequently than once every two years, while an employee who has reached the age of 50 years, not less frequently than once a year.
Employers are under the obligation to cover expenditures associated with such health examinations.
Thirdly, an employer must transfer a night employee to an appropriate job to be performed during the day if there is a doctor's opinion that the night work negatively affects the employee's health.
Fourthly, an employee who performs night work receives a supplement of not less than 50 per cent of the specified hourly or daily wage rate specified for him or her, but if a lump-sum payment has been agreed upon, a supplement of not less than 50 per cent of the piece-work rate for the amount of work done, if a collective work agreement or a contract of employment do not specify a higher supplement for night work.
Finally, a collective agreement or a contract of employment may provide for annual paid supplementary leave granted to a night employee.
Section 149 of the Labour Law stipulates that every employee has the right to annual paid leave.
Such leave may not be less than four calendar weeks, without holidays.
Persons under 18 years of age are entitled to annual paid leave of one full month.
In exceptional cases, however, when granting in the current year of the full annual paid leave to an employee may adversely affect the normal course of activities in the undertaking, it is permitted with the written consent of the employee to transfer part of the leave to the subsequent year.
In such case, the part of the leave in the current year shall not be less than two consecutive calendar weeks.
Part of the leave may be transferred only to the subsequent year.
A special protection with regard to paid leave is afforded by Section 149 (4) of the Labour Law to persons under 18 years of age, pregnant women, women for a period following childbirth up to one year as well as breastfeeding women during the whole period of breastfeeding, stating that the above-mentioned categories of persons have to take the annual leave in the current year.
It is prohibited to compensate annual paid leave with money, except in cases when employment legal relationships are terminated and the employee has not utilised his or her annual paid leave.
By agreement of an employee and the employer, annual paid leave in the current year may be granted in parts, nevertheless one part of the leave in the current year shall not be less than two uninterrupted calendar weeks.
The state holidays in Latvia are January 1st, Good Friday, Easter Sunday and Easter Monday, May 1st, 2nd Sunday of May, Pentecost Sunday, June 23rd and 24th, November 18th, December 25th, 26th and 31st.
Employees shall not be required to work on holidays prescribed by law.
If it is necessary to ensure continuity of the work process, it is permitted to require an employee to work on a holiday by granting him or her rest on another day of the week or by paying appropriate compensation (Section 144 of the Labour Law).
A general clause of Section 147 (2) of the Labour Law stipulates that an employee has the right to temporary absence if his or her immediate presence at work is not possible due to force majeure , an unexpected event or other exceptional circumstances.
The duty of an employee is to inform the employer without delay of such temporary absence.
Temporary absence may not serve as a basis for the right of an employer to give notice of termination of a contract of employment.
An additional right granted to pregnant women is an obligation of employers to ensure an opportunity for pregnant women to leave the workplace in order to undergo health examination in the prenatal period with the reservation that it is not possible to undergo such examinations outside of working time.
The Labour Law gives a woman the right to supplementary leave of 14 days added to the prenatal leave in three cases: in case of complications in the pregnancy, childbirth or postnatal period, if two or more children are born, and if the woman has initiated pregnancy-related medical care at a preventive medical institution by the 12th week of pregnancy and has continued for the whole period of pregnancy.
Moreover, a pregnant woman prior or following the birth of a child is entitled to several other benefits.
Section 37 (7) of the Labour Law stipulates that an employer, after receipt of a doctor's opinion, is prohibited from employing pregnant women and women for a period following childbirth not exceeding one year, but if the woman is breastfeeding – during the whole period of breastfeeding if it is considered that performance of the relevant work poses a threat to the safety and health of the woman or her child.
Otherwise, in order to prevent any negative effect on the safety and health of a pregnant woman, an employer, after receipt of a doctor's opinion, has a duty to ensure appropriate working conditions and working time for her.
If it is not possible to ensure such working conditions or working time, the pregnant woman should be temporarily transferred to a different, more appropriate job.
The amount of work remuneration after making amendments to the contract of employment may not be less than the previous average earnings of the woman.
Section 136 (6) and 138 (6) of the Labour Law prohibits the employment of pregnant women, women for a period up to one year after giving birth and a breastfeeding woman in overtime work or at night.
These women cannot be sent on a work trip (Section 53 (2) of the Labour Law), unless they agree.
Section 146 of the Labour Law ensures the right of every employee who has a child under one and a half years of age to additional breaks of not less than 30 minutes, which are granted not less than every three hours.
Breaks for feeding a child are included as working time, paying the average earnings for such time.
There are special provisions introduced in the Labour Law concerning the leave of other persons caring a child.
In accordance with Section 155 of the Labour Law, the father of a child is entitled to leave of 10 calendar days that is granted within a two-month period from the birth of a child.
If a mother has died in childbirth or within a period up to the 42nd day of the postnatal period or up to the 42nd day of the postnatal period has refused to take care and bring up the child, the father of the child or any other person actually taking care of the child is granted leave for the period up to the 70 th day of the child's life.
If a mother cannot take care of the child up to the 42nd day of the postnatal period due to illness, injury or other health-related reasons, the father or another person who actually takes care of the child are entitled to leave for those days on which the mother herself is not able to take care of the child.
In a family that has adopted a child under two months of age, one of the adopters enjoy a leave of 56 calendar days starting from the day of adoption of the child (Section 7 of Law “On Maternity and Sickness Insurance”).
In a family, which has adopted a child between two months and three years of age, one of the adopters shall be granted leave of 14 calendar days.
In accordance with Section 136 of the Labour Law, parental leave is granted to each of the parents.
Every employee has an individual right to parental leave in connection with the birth or adoption of a child for a period up to one and a half years until the child reaches the age of eight years.
It can be granted as a single period or in parts.
Additional security guarantees are the inclusion of the time spent by an employee on parental leave in the total length of service and retention of the previous job.
Where this is impossible, the employer has a duty to ensure equivalent or similar work.
An annual paid supplementary leave of three working days is granted to employees having three or more children under the age of 16 years or a disabled child and to employees exposed to special risk.
A collective agreement or a contract of employment may determine other cases (for instance, night work, shift work, long-term work, etc.
) where an employee also receives an annual paid supplementary leave.
Pursuant to Section 157 of the Labour Law, employees are entitled to study leave provided that the work has not been discontinued, that the studies are undertaken at an educational institution of any type and that such right is provided for in a collective work agreement or a contract of employment.
The study leave can be granted either with or without retention of work remuneration.
However, if parties to the contract of employment have not agreed the right to study leave, employers are free to deny attending of studies.
Pursuant to Section 37 of the Labour Law, it is prohibited to employ in permanent work a person under 15 years of age or who until reaching the age of 18 continues to acquire basic education.
These persons are children within the meaning of the Labour Law.
However, there are several exceptions from this general rule.
In exceptional cases children from the age of 13, if one of the parents (guardian) has given written consent, may be employed outside of school hours doing light work not harmful to the safety, health, morals and development of the child.
The Cabinet of Ministers determines jobs in which it is permitted to employ children.
Another exception relates to the employment of children in cultural, artistic, sporting and advertising activities.
The Labour Law stipulates that in case one of the parents (a guardian) has given written consent and a permit from the State Labour Inspection has been received, a child as a performer may be employed in cultural, artistic, sporting and advertising activities if such employment is not harmful to the safety, health, morals and development of the child.
In both cases such employment shall not interfere with the education of the child.
Another group of young workers – adolescents (persons between the age of 15 and 18 who are not to be considered as children) – is also subjected to a special regulation.
According to the Labour Law, it is prohibited to employ adolescents in jobs in special conditions, which are connected with increased risk to their safety, health, morals and development.
The Cabinet of Ministers determines those jobs in which the employment of adolescents is prohibited and exceptions when employment in such jobs is permitted in connection with occupational training of the adolescent.
In order to protect young workers, the Labour Law provides that an employer has a duty, prior to conclusion of a contract of employment, to inform one of the parents (guardian) of the child or adolescent regarding the assessed risk of the working environment and the labour protection measures at the relevant workplace.
Moreover, persons under 18 years of age shall be hired only after a prior medical examination and they shall, until reaching the age of 18, undergo a mandatory medical examination once a year.
Special measures of protection of young workers also include a special working time organization, prohibition to employ in overtime work and night work.
Pursuant to Section 115 of the Labour Law, parents (guardians) or the State Labour Inspection may request in writing the termination of employment legal relationships with a person who is under 18 years of age if such person performs work that jeopardises his or her safety, health or morals or negatively affects his or her development or education.
An employer, upon receiving the request, has a duty within a five-day period to terminate employment legal relationships with the employee and pay him or her compensation – not less than in the amount of one-month average earnings.
The area of law having the most thorough implementation of the principle of equal rights is labour law.
Section 7 of the Labour Law provides that everyone shall have an equal right to work, to fair, safe and healthy working conditions as well as to fair work remuneration.
Another facet of equal treatment includes occasions when a foreign employee has been sent to perform work in Latvia and renders applicable the principle of equality to such persons as well.
The Satversme ensures universal prohibition of discrimination of any kind without naming possible grounds of such discrimination.
Section 7 of the Labour Law list the grounds for discrimination leaving an open end of the enumeration.
It provides that equality has to be ensured irrespective of a person's race, skin colour, gender, age, disability, religion, political or other conviction, ethnic or social origin, property, marital status or other circumstances.
The list also contains “other circumstances” such as sexual orientation in order to avoid any possible omissions, etc.
Another aspect of equal treatment regulation in labour law is its very broad scope.
Differential treatment, which is based on any of the above-mentioned grounds is prohibited both during employment legal relationships as well as when establishing or terminating them (Section 29 (1) of the Labour Law).
Section 29 (2) of the Labour Law states that differential treatment is permitted only in cases where a particular ground is an objective and substantiated precondition for performance of the relevant work or for the relevant employment.
In respect of job advertisements it is prohibited to indicate age limitations except in cases where, in accordance with the law, persons of a certain age may not perform the relevant work.
If the principle has been violated, the employee has a right to appropriate compensation or the right to request termination of a differential treatment (Section 34 of the Labour Law for a violation of equal treatment during the establishment of an employment relationship, Section 60 for a violation of the right to equal work remuneration, Section 95 for the violation during the determination of working conditions).
If the principle of equal treatment has been violated with regard to notice of termination, such notice shall be declared invalid and an employee shall be reinstated in his or her previous work (Section 124 of the Labour Law).
An employee who has been dismissed illegally and reinstated in previous work is entitled to payment of average earnings for the whole period of forced absence from work.
Such compensation is also paid in cases where a court, although there exists a basis for the reinstatement of an employee, at the request of the employee terminates employment legal relationships by a court judgment (Section 126 of the Labour Law).
Section 59 of the Labour Law stipulates that work remuneration is the regular pay for work payable to an employee, and which includes a salary and supplements specified by regulatory enactments, the collective agreement or the contract of employment, as well as bonuses and other kinds of payments related to work.
The Labour Law regulates the issue of equal pay for the same work or the work of equal value, minimum wage, organization of work remuneration, supplements as well as other issues related to pay.
At the same time there are a number of regulations of the Cabinet of Ministers that determine pay issues, e.g., minimum monthly salary within the scope of normal working time, minimum hourly wage rates, work remuneration for specific group of workers, etc.
A general principle of equal pay is enshrined in Section 60 of the Labour Law stating that an employer has a duty to specify equal work remuneration for men and women for the same kind of work and work of equal value.
Violation of this principle entitles an employee to remuneration in amount equivalent to that paid by the employer for the same kind of work a work of equal value.
A special protection within the framework of the Labour Law is afforded to persons less than 18 years of age.
Section 63 of the Labour Law envisages that the monthly salary for adolescents employed for a shortened working time shall not be less than the minimum monthly salary within the scope of normal working time as specified by the Cabinet of Ministers.
Nevertheless, where an adolescent works in addition to pursuing secondary or occupational education, an hourly wage rate specified for the adolescent may not be less than the minimum hourly wage rate specified by the Cabinet for work within the scope of normal working time (see below).
Children, however, shall be paid for work in conformity with the work performed (Section 63 (3) of the Labour Law).
Section 107 of the Satversme stipulates that e very employed person has the right to receive, for work done, commensurate remuneration which shall not be less than the minimum wage established by the state.
The minimum wage shall not be less than the minimum level determined by the state (Section 61 of the Labour Law).
At the same time the Labour Law delegates the right to determine minimum monthly salary within the scope of normal working time, as well as minimum hourly wage rates, to the Cabinet of Ministers.
The respective regulations stipulate that the minimum monthly salary within the normal working time in 2004 is 80 LVL (121 EUR), which is an increase of 14.3% since 2003.
The minimum hourly wage rate is 0.474 LVL (0.72 EUR).
Adolescents and employees performing work in special circumstances associated with an increased risk to their safety and health, however, shall not receive less than 0.542 LVL (0.82 EUR) per hour.
In May 2003, the government announced that it planned to increase the minimum wage by 100% over a period of seven years.
This increase in the rate of the minimum wage is possible thanks to the economic growth and the efforts to combat the undeclared payment of wages.
Despite several restrictions provided for in the legislation, the most widespread way of fixing wages is individual contracts of employment and collective agreements.
The determination of wages at a local level predominates over their fixing by statutory regulations or company agreements.
There is a special work remuneration system for employees of institutions financed from the State budget with several exceptions within it (e.g.
employees of the Bureau of Prevention and Combating of Corruption, State Human Rights Bureau, the State Revenue Service etc.
).
There are two main systems of organization of work remuneration provided for by the Labour Law: a time salary system and a piecework salary system.
The time salary is calculated in conformity with the actual time worked irrespective of the amount of work done.
The piecework salary is calculated in conformity with the amount of work done irrespective of the time within which it was done (Section 62 (2) of the Labour Law).
Section 69 (5) of the Labour Law provides that work remuneration and related mandatory payments of state social insurance shall be first level payments made by the employer.
Protection of wages is closely connected to the issue of deduction.
In order to provide protection to the workers the deductions from the work remuneration are allowed only in cases specified by law.
According to the Labour Law, deductions may be made from the work remuneration payable to an employee in certain circumstances defined in Sections 78 to 80.
In accordance with Section 10 of the Labour Law, employees shall exercise the defence of their social, economic and occupational rights and interests directly, or indirectly through the mediation of employee representatives.
Employee representatives shall mean: (1) an employee trade union on behalf of which a trade union institution or an official authorized by the articles of association of the trade union acts or (2) authorized employee representatives who have been elected in accordance with the law.
The most common way of representation is a trade union representation.
If there are several employee trade unions, they shall authorize their representatives for joint negotiations with an employer in proportion to the number of members of each trade union but not less than one representative each.
Generally, employee representatives shall be elected for a specified term of office, which is set out in the collective agreement.
As regards the Labour Protection Law, trusted representatives of workers or their professional organizations that are elected in order to represent the interests of workers within the undertaking with respect to labour protection, shall be elected for a term of three years if not specified otherwise in the collective agreement.
The Law On Strikes authorizes employee and trade union representatives to establish a conciliation committee in case of a labour interest dispute (pre-strike negotiations).
In such event the term of office for the representatives shall be the one of the fulfilment of a specific task.
Employee representatives, when performing their duties, have the following rights (Section 11 of the Labour Law): (1) right to request and receive from the employer information regarding the economic and social situation of the undertaking, (2) right to receive information in good time and consult with the employer before the employer takes such decisions as may affect the interests of employees, in particular a decision which may substantially affect work remuneration, working conditions and employment in the undertaking, (3) right to take part in the determination and improvement of work remuneration provisions, working environment, working conditions and organization of working time, as well as in protecting the safety and health of employees, (4) right to enter the territory of the undertaking, as well as to have access to workplaces, (5) right to hold meetings of employees in the territory and premises of the undertaking and (6) right to monitor how regulatory enactments, the collective work agreement and working procedure regulations are being observed in employment legal relationships.
The rights of employee representatives have to be exercised so that the efficiency of the operations of the undertaking is not reduced.
Employee representatives have the duty not to disclose information brought to their attention that is a commercial secret of the employer.
However, such information has to be indicated in writing.
Performance of the duties of an employee representative may not serve as a basis for refusal to enter into a contract of employment, for termination of a contract of employment, or for otherwise restricting the rights of an employee
Currently co-determination rights are not well developed in Latvia and exist only to the extent that is determined by collective agreements.
Work councils do not exist at national level either.
Nevertheless, there is a law regarding European Works Councils (On Informing Employees of European Community-scale Commercial Companies and European Community-scale Groups of Commercial Companies and Consulting Such Employees), which is meant to be one of co-determination mechanisms at the European level.
Section 102 of the Satversme provides that everyone has the right to form and join associations, political parties and other public organizations.
Section 108 stipulates inter alia that the State shall protect the freedom of trade unions.
The Law on Trade Unions, as amended in 2003, stipulates that the residents of the Republic of Latvia shall have the right to freely form trade unions.
Labour Law also provides that employees, as well as employers shall have the right to freely unite in organizations and to join them in order to defend their social, economic and occupational rights and interests.
Moreover, affiliation of an employee with the above organizations or the desire of an employee to join such organizations may not serve as a basis for refusal to enter into a contract of employment, for termination of a contract of employment or for otherwise restricting the rights of an employee.
Latvian policemen and soldiers of armed forces on active service are prohibited by law from forming and joining trade unions.
The law provides that trade unions in Latvia may be formed on the basis of professional, branch, territorial or other principles.
Employers shall also be entitled to form trade unions.
The most widespread patterns in practice are the branch, undertaking and professional trade unions.
The right to join union includes also that of not joining or withdrawing from a union (so-called negative right).
Currently there are no security clauses authorized under national law and it has not been observed also in practice.
Section 12 of the Law On Trade Unions provides that property and financial relations between trade unions and the employer shall be governed by law, collective agreements and other agreements.
In most cases collection of union dues is regulated by collective agreements.
Thus, collection of union dues by check-off is common to Latvia and is a usual practice.
Section 3 of the Law On Trade Unions stipulates that a trade union is registered by the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Latvia if the number of members is not under 50 or not less than one quarter of the persons working in an enterprise, institution, organization, profession or branch.
This law was amended in May 2003, changing the registration requirements of trade unions, but there is still no English translation available.
Section 2 of the Law On Employers' Organisations and their Associations stipulates that an employers' organization is a public organization founded by at least five employers and which represents and protects economic, social and professional interests of its members.
The Ministry of Justice reviews the relevant application for the registration of the trade union in a month following the date of receipt of the application and statute of the trade union.
Registration of the trade union shall be rejected where requirements of the law “On Trade Unions” are violated or where activities provided for in the statute are in contradiction with the Latvian legislation in force.
Such rejection shall be subject to appeal in court.
Following the date of registration of the trade union by the Ministry of Justice, the trade union acquires legal personality.
The independence and equality of the rights of trade unions are guaranteed by Section 4 of the Law “On Trade Unions” according to which trade unions are independent from state authority, state administration institutions and other organizations and are equal in their rights.
The above Section also lays down the right of trade unions to join international trade union organizations, to conclude agreements and contracts with them as well as with trade unions of other countries.
Section 7 (3) of the Law “On Employers' Organisations and their Associations” stipulates that employers' organizations and their associations must not directly or indirectly restrict the right of workers to unite in trade unions or interfere in their work.
Section 15 of the Law On Trade Unions provides that the employer cannot terminate an individual labour agreement with a member of a trade union on his own initiative without prior consent of the trade union, excluding occasions where work discipline or the labour agreement has been violated.
The same in substance is fixed in the new Labour Law (Section 110 of the Labour Law).
Where there is no such consent of the relevant trade union, the employer may, within a one-month period from the date of receipt of the reply, bring an action in court for termination of the contract of employment.
Special provisions in respect of the relationships between trade unions and employers' organizations are provided for by the Law On Employers' Organisations and their Associations.
Hence, Section 7 provides inter alia that employers' organizations and their associations are not allowed to influence directly or indirectly the right of employees to join trade unions or to influence their functioning.
There is no special procedure for the reimbursement of remedies in case of unfair labour practice.
The collective bargaining authority in Latvia mostly lays “in the hands” of employees and employer's organizations themselves.
The role of the state is to provide them with the necessary framework decisions in order to make their activities as effective as possible.
The general right to collective bargaining stems from the Constitution (Section 108) whereby employed persons have the right to a collective labour agreement, and the right to strike.
Issues as to collective agreements are enshrined in the Labour Law , while the right to collective action is contained in the Law On Strikes.
Some issues of collective bargaining may also be found in the Labour Disputes Law .
The necessary legal background for trade unions and employers' organizations is contained in Law On Trade Unions and the Law On Employers' Organisations and their Associations respectively.
For instance, Section 11 of the Law “On Employers' Organisations and their Associations” promotes and makes it a responsibility of the employers' organizations or their associations to recognize trade unions, involve in negotiations with them, conclude collective labour agreements and general agreements.
In Latvia collective bargaining takes place mainly at two levels: the company level and the branch level.
2287 collective agreements were concluded in 2001 covering 203374 employees.
2167 of total collective agreements were concluded at the company level and 17 at the branch level.
Parties to collective bargaining at the company level are the employer, the employee trade union or authorized employee representatives if the employees have not formed a trade union.
A collective work agreement in a sector or territory (general agreement) shall be entered into by an employer, a group of employers, an organization of employers or an association of organizations of employers, and an employee trade union or an association (union) of employee trade unions if the parties to the general agreement have relevant authorization or if the right to enter into a general agreement is provided for by the Arts of association of such associations (unions).
The entering into a collective agreement shall be proposed by employee representatives, the employer or their associations (unions).
An employer is not entitled to refuse to enter into negotiations regarding the conclusion of a collective work agreement.
A reply in writing to a proposal of collective bargaining shall be provided within a 10-day period from the date of receipt of the proposal.
Extending the binding effects of collective agreements
If members of an organization of employers or an association of employers' organizations employ more than 60 per cent of the employees in a sector, a general agreement entered into between them and an employee trade union or an association (union) of employee trade unions is binding on all employers of the relevant sector and applies to all employees employed by the employers.
With respect to such employers and employees, the general agreement comes into effect on the day of its publication in the newspaper Latvijas Vēstnesis (official newspaper of the Republic of Latvia), after a joint application of the parties.
According to Section 13 of the Labour Disputes Law, a collective labour interest dispute is defined as a dispute between the parties that emerges during the process of collective bargaining with regard to setting up working conditions or employment regulations.
In accordance with the regulations laid down both in the Strike Law and the Labour Disputes Law , a definite procedure should be followed in order to ultimately reach a positive solution of demands brought forward.
The first step taken in case of a collective labour interest dispute is the shaping and submission of demands to the other party.
Section 14 of the Labour Disputes Law provides that the demands should be brought to the attention of an employer, a group of employers, an employers' organization or an administrative institution of an industry in written.
An employer has the duty to review the submitted demands and to provide an answer within three days.
If the answer is not given or is negative, the collective labour interest dispute is forwarded to the conciliation commission.
Hearing of a collective labour interest dispute in the conciliation commission as laid down in Section 15 of the Labour Dispute Law is the second intrinsic prerequisite of the strike action.
Both parties to the collective interest dispute within three days from the receipt of the negative answer to their demands establish a conciliation commission composed of an equal number of representatives.
Parties prepare their statement of disagreement and submit it to the conciliation commission.
The latter reviews it and takes a decision within one week.
The decision taken by the conciliation commission is binding upon the parties and has the status of a collective agreement.
If the parties fail to reach an agreement in the conciliation commission and there are no ways found for strike-prevention, the collective labour interest dispute has to be settled in accordance with the procedure prescribed by the collective agreement.
In the absence of such a procedure, the dispute is either settled by method of reconciliation or arbitration or it is followed by a collective action to defend parties' rights, e.g.
a strike or a lock out.
Pursuant to Section 16 of the Labour Dispute Law, reconciliation is a settlement of a collective interest dispute by means of a third person acting as an independent and impartial conciliator.
Reconciliation can be approached only by the mutual agreement of the parties.
During the process of reconciliation, parties are cannot exercise the right to collective action.
There can be one conciliator or a board of conciliators consisting of at least three persons.
Only persons having capacity to act can undertake duties of a conciliator.
Conciliators can be either private (persons who have been selected by parties to the dispute themselves and which are not included in the list approved by National Tripartite Co-operation Board) or public (persons included in the above-mentioned list).
Public reconciliation is without charge.
The conciliator is entrusted with the duty to undertake all the necessary action in order to settle the collective labour dispute and reach an agreement.
Such an agreement has the effect of a collective agreement.
Intrinsic features of the conciliator are fairness, impartiality and independence.
Arbitration, on the other hand, is another method of settling collective labour disputes by which a third, neutral party is authorized to take a decision by seeking to reach a fair solution and balancing economical and other interests of the parties.
Arbitration can be employed with the consent of both parties either straight after the conciliation commission has failed or following crack-up during reconciliation.
Compared to the reconciliation procedure, arbitration involves a more active approach from the people entrusted with the resolution of a dispute.
The setting up and the proceedings of arbitration are regulated by the Civil Procedure Law (Nr.
E0044). An agreement reached as a result of arbitration, like the one reached as a result of conciliation or reconciliation, has the effect of a collective agreement.
The employees' right to strike is one of the fundamental rights in Latvia and is enshrined in Section 108 of the Satversme.
The main legislative acts dealing with strike issues are the Strike Law, as amended, determining rights and duties of all parties involved, restrictions to striking rights, procedure of strike monitoring, responsibility for violation of the right to strike, etc., as well as the Labour Disputes Law.
There are several other legislative acts laying down restrictions to the right to strike on certain categories of employees.
According to the Satversme and Section 3 of the Strike Law, employees are entitled the right to strike in order to protect their economic or professional interests.
This general right, however, is not absolute and can be restricted in public interest in respect of certain categories of persons (see below).
Furthermore, pursuant to Section 13.1.4. of the Law On State of Emergency, the Cabinet of Ministers has a right, while declaring the state of emergency, to prohibit any strikes for a certain period of time.
The announcement or participation in a strike is not considered as a violation of the Labour Law or a contract of employment and therefore cannot serve as the ground for dismissal of an employee (Section 26 (1) of the Strike Law).
Employees participating in a strike in conformity with the procedure laid down in the Strike Law and the Labour Disputes Law retain their office and are not subject to disciplinary punishment.
Employees participating in a strike do not receive a regular pay for work and social insurance payments for this period of time unless otherwise agreed in a collective agreement.
Nevertheless, those employees working in essential services during the strike receive regular pay for work in accordance with the work actually done.
Other employees not participating in the strike and continuing their work receive regular pay for work in accordance with their contract of employment and collective agreement and remain bound by them.
The latter cannot be forced to undertake the work of employees participating in a strike.
Trade unions, employee's authorized representatives or employees themselves have the right to announce a strike on four occasions.
Firstly, the right can be exercised if the collective labour interest dispute has not been settled in a conciliation commission and the parties have not agreed on settling the dispute by method of reconciliation or by arbitration.
Secondly, such right applies when the parties fail to settle the dispute by reconciliation and the parties do not resort to arbitration.
Thirdly, a party has the right to strike when, within a period of 10 days, procedural requirements such as the establishment of a conciliation commission or the commencement of the resolution of a dispute before a commission, reconciliation or arbitration are not observed.
Finally, the strike can be launched if the employer (or employer's organization) violates an agreement reached during any stage of negotiations.
In the latter occasion the scrupulous procedure of initiation of a strike can be ignored.
Pursuant to Section 13 of the Strike Law, a trade union, upon decision of the strike announcement, shall establish a strike committee that would lead the strike and would represent interests of relevant trade unions or employees of an enterprise during strike negotiations with an employer.
No later than 10 days before the strike, the strike committee submits to the employer, the State Labour Inspection and the Secretary of Tripartite Consultative Council of Employers, the State and Trade Unions the starting time of the strike, its venue, reasons, demands, the names of the leaders of the strike committee and the resolution of the meeting on the strike announcement.
Demands that were not included in the initial strike announcement are illegal.
The right to strike is not absolute.
Section 116 of the Satversme stipulates that the right to strike may be subject to restrictions in circumstances provided for by law in order to protect the rights of other people, the democratic structure of the state, as well as public safety, welfare and morals.
Section 16 of the Strike Law lists the categories of persons who have no right to strike.
Judges, public prosecutors, police officers, firemen, border-guards, employees of state security institutions, warders of imprisonment and persons serving in National Armed Forces are not allowed to strike.
The Law On Bureau of Prevention and Combating of Corruption adds the officials of this bureau as a category of this list.
In addition, the employees in “essential services” have a limited right to strike, which has to be balanced with public interests.
Essential services are defined as services provided by such enterprises, where the termination of work can endanger the state security or security, health or life of society, a group of people or separate individuals (Section 17 (1) of the Strike Law).
It is the duty of an employer and a strike committee to ensure that minimum work is carried out in essential services during a strike.
They must appoint a certain number of employees that will perform the above-mentioned work during the strike as well as determine the amount of work to be done.
The refusal to perform such work or to follow instructions is considered to be a violation of the Labour Law.
If necessary an employer and a strike committee also have to agree on such activities as the maintenance of an enterprise, its equipment, machinery, etc.
The termination of a strike is either voluntary or mandatory.
The parties to a collective labour dispute are free to cancel their demands and to end a strike at any stage.
Only a court may find illegal a strike or a strike announcement.
The court does so if it establishes a violation of the Strike Law, if the strike has been announced during the operation of the collective agreement in order to amend provisions of this collective agreement, if it is a solidarity strike and does not concern the conclusion or the implementation of a general agreement, if the strike is proposed to express political demands, political support or political protest, or if the strike is related to issues, which have already been agreed upon during strike negotiations.
The legal consequences emerging from finding a strike or its announcement illegal are the termination of an ongoing strike or the prohibition to strike if it is not yet commenced.
Moreover, if the court has received an application on recognition of the illegality of a strike prior to the date of its commencement, within 5 days of its announcement, the right to strike is suspended until the final ruling enters into force.
Unlike the right to strike, the right to lock out is not enshrined in the Satversme.
The right to lock out was introduced by the Law on Labour Disputes in 2003.
A lockout is the employers' counteraction against employees' right to strike with an aim to protect their own economic interests.
It is considered as the employers' right to collective action, provided for by the Law on Strikes.
Similarly to strikes, the only limitations to the right to lockout concern institutions of state and local municipalities as well as essential services determined by Section 17 of the Strike Law (see above).
Section 21 (2) of the Labour Disputes Law defines a lockout as a refusal to employ employees as well as to pay any work remuneration if the strike significantly affects economic activities of an enterprise, providing the number of employees suffering in result of the lockout does not exceed the number of striking employees.
The decision to lock out is adopted by an employer himself or by a qualified majority of members of the employers' organization.
The indispensable prerequisite of a lockout action is the submission of the lockout announcement to respective employees or their representatives as well as to the National Tripartite Co-operation Board and the State Labour Inspection.
The latter is in charge of monitoring lockouts and possesses the right to postpone it for a period of up to three months in case of necessity to take action to prevent natural disasters, large accidents or epidemics or their effects.
Another similarity with strikes undertaken by employees is made by the prerogative of the court to hear cases on finding a lockout or its announcement illegal following an application submitted within five days from the lockout announcement.
The lockout or its announcement is found illegal on two occasions: if it stands in contradiction with the provisions of the Labour Disputes Law or if it is directed against the exercise of the right to association, thereby violating the fundamental right enshrined in Section 102 and 108 of the Satversme.
An illegal lockout has to be immediately terminated.
An additional guarantee of employees' rights is the employers' duty to recover losses of employees made in result of an illegal lockout.
The main source of law governing the settlement of individual labour disputes is the Labour Disputes Law .
Section 4 of this law defines an individual labour dispute as a disagreement between an employee or a group of employees and an employer concerning the conclusion, amendment, termination or implementation of the contract of employment or the application or interpretation of statutory enactments, collective agreements or working procedure regulations.
There are three stages in the settlement of individual labour disputes.
The first stage is the negotiations within an enterprise between an employee and an employer.
However, this is not a compulsory stage and its omission does not affect the parties' right to apply to a labour disputes commission or to the court.
Where the individual labour dispute is not settled during the negotiations within the enterprise, the parties to the dispute have the right, upon mutual agreement, to advance the dispute to the labour disputes commission established within the enterprise or chosen by any other means for settling the dispute.
Parties are free to stipulate the establishment of a labour disputes commission in collective agreements.
Exceptions to this principle are contained in Section 7 of the Labour Disputes Law, pursuant to which the following cases are reviewed exclusively in court: (1) the invalidation of a notice of termination by an employer and the reinstatement of an employee, (2) the application of an employer, in case of refusal by the employee trade union to accept the notice of termination of a contract of employment to the member of an employee trade union, (3) the exacting of undue payments, (4) the violation of the principle of equal treatment, (5) the application of an employer or an employee, where the termination of a contract of employment is claimed by a third party.
When the parties favour the labour disputes commission, they shall conclude a written agreement providing for the composition of the commission, its competence, terms and other issues concerning the operation of the commission.
The commission consists of equal number of representatives from both parties.
Members of the commission shall be impartial and may not have any direct or indirect interest in the outcome of a particular case.
Moreover, independence of the members of the commission during the exercise of their duties shall be guaranteed by the prohibition of any interference or influence on their work.
The labour disputes commission shall review the case within 10 days running from the submission of the application.
The commission is not deterred to review a case and shall deliver its decision without the presence of any of the parties.
The commission takes the decision by majority voting.
The decision taken by the labour disputes commission shall be compulsory and has to be executed within 10 days.
Where the decision has not been executed voluntarily, the other party has the right to appeal to the court.
The decision enters into force after 10 days provided the decision has not been appealed to the court.
The review of an individual labour dispute by a court, in accordance with the civil procedure is the third and final stage.
Each party has the right to plead to court if: (1) the parties have not settled the dispute during the negotiation stage, (2) a party is not satisfied with the decision taken by the labour disputes commission, (3) the decision taken by the labour disputes commission is not enforced, (4) the dispute involves one of the exceptional occasions when the case is heard directly by the court (listed above).
The fact that the court is the first instance does not serve a ground for refusal to admit an application.
Individual labour disputes may not be reviewed in arbitration.
It has to be noted that during settlement of individual labour disputes, trade unions have a special right to represent the trade union members without special authorization as well as they have the right to bring the case to court on behalf of its members.
In France, you can start working at 16.
Foreign minors intending to work in France must comply with the same legal requirements as adults.
They need a work permit as well.
Whether you are seeking temporary or permanent employment, you have the same legal rights.
Even if you will only be working for a short time, the employer must fulfil certain obligations: you must sign a contract.
This can be a permanent contract (CDI), a fixed-term contract (CDD), a contract for seasonal work or a temporary employment contract (CTT).
Both you and the employer must sign the contract, except for some permanent contract, that can be oral.
If these obligations are not respected, you would be employed illegally.
In this case you would lose any right to social protection, including potential unemployment benefits.
You would not be covered if you had an accident in the workplace.
The contract must include some elements, like:
The permanent contract (CDI- Contrat à Durée Indéterminée ) is for an unlimited period.
A written contract is not compulsory unless the employee is working part-time or there is a collective agreement which requires one.
The employee may be required to work a trial period, from one to six months.
During the trial period the employer or the employee can terminate the contract without notice.
After the trial period, an employee can resign at any moment without giving a reason.
There are no specific legal requirements concerning notice but employees may need to comply with time limits specified by custom, collective agreements or company agreements.
The temporary employment contract (CTT- Contrat de Travail Temporaire) is used to carry out a specific task, called a ”mission” for a certain period of time.
The temporary worker is employed by an agency (Agence de Travail Temporaire) which has a contract with the employer.
The employee must be provided with a written contract specifying the terms of the ”mission” within two working days of taking up the employment.
The contract cannot be terminated before the date given, except for serious professional misconduct or circumstances beyond anyone’s control.
A contract cannot exceed 18 months for the same ”mission” (24 months in some cases).
At the end of each ”mission”, the employee receives an end of ‘mission’ payment equal to at least 10% of the total gross pay for the contract.
In France there is a guaranteed minimum hourly wage called the SMIC.
An employee cannot legally be paid less than this level.
The gross SMIC is EUR 8.27 since July 1st 2006.
Some professions and types of work are governed by collective agreements.
Within these agreements, there are normally specifications for minimum salary levels, sick-leave rights and overtime or irregular working hours.
During maternity leave, employees receive payments from the social security system.
Most companies have also collective agreements concerning continuing payment of the salary by the employer during the period of maternity leave.
Much legislation exists to promote equal rights in the workplace for women.
However, legislation also exists to protect women from hard working conditions.
For example women can not be employed to carry loads superior to 25 kilos, can not work in mines or quarries, or work with dangerous chemical products.
Pregnant women can not work outdoors after 22.00.
The FMLA allows employees to balance their work and family life by taking reasonable unpaid leave for certain reasons.
The FMLA is intended to balance the demands of the workplace with the needs of families, to promote the stability and economic security of families, and to promote national interests in preserving family integrity.
The FMLA seeks to accomplish these purposes in a manner that accommodates the legitimate interests of employers, and which minimizes the potential for employment discrimination on the basis of sex, while promoting equal employment opportunity for men and women.
The enactment of the FMLA was predicated on two fundamental concerns the needs of the U.S. workforce and the development of high-performance organizations.
Increasingly, American children and growing numbers of the elderly are dependent on working family members who spend long hours on the job.
When family emergencies arise, requiring employees to attend to their seriously-ill children or parents, or to newly-born or adopted infants, or even to their own serious illness, workers need reassurance that they will not need to choose between their job security and meeting their personal and family obligations or tending to vital needs at home.
A covered employer must grant an eligible employee up to a total of 12 work-weeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period for one or more of the following reasons:
Intermittent Leave Under some circumstances, employees may take FMLA leave intermittently which means taking leave in blocks of time, or by reducing their normal weekly or daily work schedule.
Other Benefits Certain types of earned benefits, such as seniority, need not continue to accrue during periods of unpaid FMLA leave.
For other benefits, such as elected life insurance coverage, the employer and the employee need to make arrangements so that the benefits may be maintained during periods of unpaid FMLA leave.
Except for accrued or earned benefits (such as seniority), the employee must be restored to the same benefits upon return from FMLA leave as if the employee had continued to work the entire FMLA leave period.
Use of FMLA leave cannot result in the loss of any benefit that accrued before the employee's leave began.
Accordingly, an FMLA leave period cannot be counted as a break in service for purposes of vesting or eligibility to participate in benefit programs.
Salaried executive, administrative, and professional employees of covered employers who meet the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) criteria for exemption from minimum wage and overtime under Regulations, 29 CFR Part 541, do not lose their FLSA-exempt status by using any unpaid FMLA leave.
This special exception to the "salary basis" requirements for FLSA's exemption extends only to "eligible" employees' use of leave required by FMLA.
No.
FMLA leave is generally unpaid leave.
However, in certain circumstances the use of accrued paid leave such as vacation or sick leave may be substituted for the unpaid leave required by the law.
Q. How much unpaid leave am I entitled to?
The FMLA permits leave for birth or placement for adoption or foster care to be taken intermittently that is, in blocks of time or by reducing the normal weekly or daily work schedule subject to approval by the employer.
Leave for a serious health condition may be taken intermittently when "medically necessary.
"
Generally no, provided the leave is taken for a legitimate family or medical reason and all appropriate notice and certification requirements are met.
However, employers with established policies regarding outside employment while on paid or unpaid leave may uniformly apply this policy to employees on FMLA leave.
Your employer is required to maintain health insurance coverage on the same terms it was provided before the leave commences, as if you continued to work.
In addition, the use of FMLA leave cannot result in the loss of any employment benefit that accrued prior to the start of your leave.
Certain other earned benefits, such as seniority, do not need to continue to accrue during a period of unpaid FMLA leave.
And for still other kinds of benefits, such as elected life insurance coverage, arrangements may need to be made between you and your employer so that they are continued during a period of FMLA leave.
With the sole exception of accrued or earned benefits such as seniority, unless you elect otherwise, you must be restored to the same benefits upon return from FMLA leave as if you had continued to work during the period of the leave.

Labour Relations in the Hotel and Catering Sectors
Cyprus supports a voluntary system of labour relations.
This means that the social partners are free to agree the terms and conditions of employment and government intervention (i.e.
Labour Law) is limited to setting the minimum standards for the terms and conditions of employment (Mainstream Labour Law) and to offering protection for vulnerable groups of employees (Specialised Labour Law).
After the establishment of the Republic of Cyprus, in 1960, the Social Partners signed the so-called Basic Agreement - a voluntary agreement - laying out procedures for the settlement of labour disputes and concluding collective agreements.
This agreement was, in 1977, succeeded by the Industrial Relations Code, which is also a voluntary agreement (not legally enforceable) that lays out the procedures to be followed for the settlement of labour disputes, and the procedures to be followed for arbitration, mediation and public inquiry in disputes over interests and disputes over rights.
In relation to the Labour Laws in the Hotel and Catering sectors, the terms and conditions of employment are regulated both by the Mainstream Labour Legislation, which mainly consists of Laws that harmonise E.U Directives in the area of Labour Law and the Specialised Laws that regulate the minimum standards for the terms and conditions of employment.
With regards to collective agreements, sectoral agreements are in force between employer organisations and trade unions.
In the hotel industry, the employers are represented by PASYXE and EXEK-STEK and in the catering industry, they are represented by OSIKA.
Employees are being represented through three trade unions, namely, OYXEV-SEK , SYXKA-PEO and ALLAGI-DEOK .
Maximum weekly working hours are 48 including overtime.
Overtime should not be more than 8 hours weekly .
Minimum compensation for overtime work payment of 1,5 hour for every 1 hour of work.
The employer or the employee, depending on the party that terminates the employment relationship, is obliged to give a specific period of notice (according to the length of service) or to pay the corresponding compensation.
Special provisions regulate increased notice or compensation during the summer period.
Maximum weekly working hours are 48 including overtime.
Overtimes should not be more than 9 hours weekly .
Minimum compensation for overtime work payment of 1,5 hour for every 1 hour of work.
During the first month of service, termination of employment can take place without any obligation on the part of the employer or the employee.
After that, the employer or the employee, depending on the party that terminates the employment relationship, is obliged to give a specific period of notice (according to the length of service) or to pay the corresponding compensation.
Special provisions regulate increased notice or compensation during the summer period.
In addition to the above Legislation, Mainstream Labour Laws apply to the employees of these industries.
In both the hotel and the catering industries, sectoral collective agreements are in force.
Although, these agreements are not legally binding, all hoteliers, with few exceptions, follow the provisions of these agreements for trade union members.
In the catering industry, the agreement is not applied at the same level as the hotel industry, although a good majority of the employers are attaining the provisions of the agreement.
Collective agreements are concluded through the mechanisms instituted by the Industrial Relations Code.
Breaches of these agreements are also solved through the abovementioned mechanisms.
These mechanisms involve, direct negotiations between the trade unions and the employer and his/her representatives.
If no solution is found at this stage, the Ministry of Labour and Social Insurance offers mediation services, through our Department.
Finally, trade unions and employers have the right to submit their dispute to an independent arbitrator or to a public inquiry committee.
(a) Collective Agreement in the HOTEL INDUSTRY
The main provisions of the collective agreement in the hotel industry are the following:
5-day working week with the normal weekly working hours fixed to 38 and the normal daily working hours to 7 hours and 36 minutes.
An agreement for flexible working hours is also in force.
Allowance for shift work is18% of the salary (a maximum applies).
Medical and pharmaceutical treatment is offered through the trade unions’ Medical Schemes for which both employers and employees contribute.
During the period between 01/11 of one year and 31/03 of the next, hotels may choose to suspend their operation.
During this period, specific clauses of the collective agreement regulate employment in the hotel industry.
More details on this collective agreement can be found by contacting either the Trade Unions or Employer Organsations.
(b) Collective Agreement in the CATERING INDUSTRY
The main provisions of the collective agreement in the catering industry are the following:
Medical and pharmaceutical treatment is offered through the trade unions’ Medical Schemes for which both employers and employees contribute.
During the period between 01/11 of one year and 31/03 of the next, catering establishments may choose to suspend their operation.
During this period, specific clauses of the collective agreement regulate employment in the catering industry
More details on this collective agreement can be found by contacting either the Trade Unions (OYXEV-SEK, SYXKA-PEO and ALLAGI-DEOK ) or Employer Organsations (Hotel Industry: PASYXE and EXEK-STEK and catering industry: OSIKA).
Non-teaching staff are demanding wage rises and other benefits promised by the state government in 2005.
These include Union Grants Commission pay scales, assured-career promotion benefits and the representation of non-teaching staff in university senates and syndicates.
Bihar State University and College Employees Federation members this week burned effigies of the government’s pay scale report, declaring that the government wants to divide non-teaching employees by recommending different pay scales for college and university staff.
MSMRA said the drug industry has been violating labour laws, which include requirements to give appointment letters and maintain service and leave registers, for a long time.
Kadapa Municipal contractual workers, including water works, parks, street lighting and bill collectors, walked off the job on August 17 for a one-day hunger strike to demand a raise in monthly minimum pay from 4,000 rupees ($US89) to 7,100 rupees.
Municipal Workers and Employees Union members demonstrated at the municipal offices to issue a 23-point charter of demands, which include disbursal of salaries of employees pending for the last three months and provident fund accounts for permanent employees, allotment of house sites to contractual workers, retirement benefits to those retiring prior to April 1, 2010, regularisation of contract workers, weekly holidays and casual leave.
Inter Company Employees Union members at tile manufacturer Lanka Tiles walked off the job on August 12 for an indefinite period after six months of talks for a new collective agreement reached a deadlock.
The workers’ demands have not been reported.
In July, the Free Trade Union of Workers, a union representing over 130,000 garment employees, dropped previous demands for a 53 percent minimum wage rise.
It accepted a $US5 monthly increase offered by the Labour Advisory Committee, a body made up of government officials and industry representatives.
The rise means the minimum monthly wage will be $61, far below the $93 workers were demanding.
The CLC and other smaller unions are demanding that the minimum wage be set at $95.
KC Gecin Enterprises employs over 160 construction workers in Kandal province, whom the Building and Wood Workers Trade Union of Cambodia has been attempting to organise into a union.
Academic staff at the University of South Australia's Adelaide campus walked out for 24 hours on August 16 as part of their salary and conditions dispute.
It is the third stoppage by academics this month.
The National Tertiary Education Union has been in negotiation for two years for improved working conditions and job security for casual staff.
The union also wants an improvement on the 18 percent pay rise offer over three years.
These schemes cover the following risks: Old-age, invalidity, sickness, maternity, work injuries & occupational diseases, mortality.
Thus, having paid social insurance contributions on behalf of the employees, employers are not to pay for any costs associated with the compensation of those risks confronted by employees.
In addition, for foreign nationals working in Turkey, only short-term risks (maternity leave, sickness, work injuries and occupational diseases) are covered by the associated scheme.
On the other hand, foreign citizens can voluntarily register to social insurance institutions for the long-term risk coverage (invalidity, old-age, mortality).
However, citizens of the countries with which reciprocity agreements in the power of law have been made are to be fully covered (compulsory) by the relevant social insurance scheme.
These countries are UK, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Switzerland, France, Sweden, Libya, Denmark, Norway, and Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.
Employees covered by SSK are also to be covered by the Unemployment Insurance.
The Unemployment Insurance contribution rates (in percent of the contribution base for an employee) are as follows:
An employer is free to fire the employees.
In addition, employees may leave the work for reasons such as military service (men), maternity (women) and retirement.
If one of these events occurs, the employer has to pay a Severance Pay to the leaving/fired employee.
In case an employer fires an employee due to an unacceptable behaviour (as defined by the Labour Law) of the employee, then no severance pay is made by the employer.
the authorised trade union (authorisation is only possible when a trade union covers at least 50% of workers in a workplace and at least 10% of the workers in the relevant industry).
Collective bargaining agreements are benefited by workers registered to a trade union.
So as to prevent social unrest, the labour law makes enterprises with 50 or more employees employ
A workplace health unit is composed of a doctor and a nurse (or a health officer) both of who have been licensed by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security.
Depending on the number people employed and the level of risks, part-time or full-time employment of those health personnel is possible.
Minimum wage is applied nation-wide and updated periodically.
The Minimum Wage Commission composed of the social partners advices the Government on what the minimum wage ought to be, and the Government determines the amount taking into account this advised figure.
As explained in the above sections, total cost of an employee to the employer is the gross wage plus social insurance and unemployment insurance contributions made by the employer (employer’s total contribution is 21.5% of the contribution base.
For workplaces with high work safety risks the rate may extend to a level up to 27%).
Net Wage= Gross Wage - Social insurance and unemployment insurance contributions by the employee - taxes (personal income tax and stamp tax)
As explained in the relevant sections, social insurance and unemployment insurance contributions to be made by an employee are 14% and 1% of the contribution base, respectively.
If the total number of working hours exceeds 45 hours, the difference between it and 45 is considered as overtime and the overtime work is granted 50% extra wage.
In a year, total amount of overtime cannot exceed 270 hours.
Pursuant to the Labour Law and taking into account the relevant EU Directives, the following regulations are to be obeyed by enterprises so as to assure work health and safety, and fit and proper relations between employers and employees:
The regulation for the work conditions of agricultural and forestry jobs
The regulation for the Wage Guarantee Fund (this fund is a sub-fund under the Unemployment Insurance scheme and is supposed to pay the wages of people working for a company subject to bankruptcy processes)
Labour law (or "labor", or "employment" law) is the body of laws, administrative rulings, and precedents which address the legal rights of, and restrictions on, working people and their organizations.
As such, it mediates many aspects of the relationship between trade unions, employers and employees.
The FLSA establishes minimum wage, overtime pay, recordkeeping, and youth employment standards affecting employees in the private sector and in Federal, State, and local governments.
Covered nonexempt workers are entitled to a minimum wage of not less than $7.25 per hour effective July 24, 2009.
Overtime pay at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate of pay is required after 40 hours of work in a workweek.
Covered employers must grant an eligible employee up to a total of 12 workweeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period for one or more of the following reasons: * for the birth and care of the newborn child of the employee; * for placement with the employee of a son or daughter for adoption or foster care; * to care for an immediate family member (spouse, child, or parent) with a serious health condition; or * to take medical leave when the employee is unable to work because of a serious health condition.
Unemployment insurance provides workers, whose jobs have been terminated through no fault of their own, monetary payments for a given period of time or until they find a new job.
Unemployment payments (compensation) are intended to provide an unemployed worker time to find a new job equivalent to the one lost without financial distress.
Without employment compensation many workers would be forced to take jobs for which they were overqualified or end up on welfare.
Unemployment compensation is also justified in for sustaining consumer spending during periods of economic adjustment.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) of the U.S. Department of Labor is the principal Federal agency responsible for measuring labor market activity, working conditions, and price changes in the economy.
Our mission is to collect, analyze, and disseminate essential economic information to support public and private decision–making.
As an independent statistical agency, BLS serves its diverse user communities by providing products and services that are objective, timely, accurate, and relevant.
The Department of Labor fosters and promotes the welfare of the job seekers, wage earners, and retirees of the United States by improving their working conditions, advancing their opportunities for profitable employment, protecting their retirement and health care benefits, helping employers find workers, strengthening free collective bargaining, and tracking changes in employment, prices, and other national economic measurements.
In carrying out this mission, the Department administers a variety of Federal labor laws including those that guarantee workers’ rights to safe and healthful working conditions; a minimum hourly wage and overtime pay; freedom from employment discrimination; unemployment insurance; and other income support.
The DOL Wage and Hour Division (WHD) is responsible for enforcing some of our nation’s most comprehensive federal labor laws on topics, including the minimum wage, overtime pay, recordkeeping, youth employment and special employment, family and medical leave, migrant workers, lie detector tests, worker protections in certain temporary worker programs, and the prevailing wages for government service and construction contracts.
Various arguments have been advanced over the years in support of international labour law.
The argument concerning international competition was used in its most extensive form throughout the 19th and at the beginning of the 20th century.
The argument was that international agreements in the field of labour would help prevent international competition from taking place to the disadvantage of workers, and would constitute a kind of code of fair competition between employers and between countries.
The International Labour Organization (ILO) is devoted to advancing opportunities for women and men to obtain decent and productive work in conditions of freedom, equity, security and human dignity.
Its main aims are to promote rights at work, encourage decent employment opportunities, enhance social protection and strengthen dialogue in handling work-related issues.
The NELC is an organization primarily composed of minority outside and in-house attorneys throughout the United States and abroad who represent private and public sector employers in all aspects of labor and employment matters.
The conference is directed to attorneys and senior level human resources professionals representing management in labor and employment law.
This is an advanced program for practitioners with significant experience representing exclusively management in labor and employment law.
In the context of the Global Jobs Pact adopted by the ILO in June 2009, the strengthening of labour administration is a core objective in the promotion of sound and efficient economic and social policies at both international and national levels.
Current challenges such as the crisis in employment require the adoption and implementation of responsive and efficient labour policies that can be put into practice through well-coordinated and efficiently operating labour administration machinery, including viable labour ministries, effective employment services, adequate information and proper consultation of social partners.
Labour administration has been on the ILO agenda ever since the organization was founded 90 years ago.
The creation of the ILO in 1919 led to the formation in many countries of ministries of labour, which went on to play a pivotal role within the broad framework of promoting good governance, shaping government activity on various levels.
More recently, in the last two decades labour ministries in many countries have responded to contemporary challenges by formulating employment policies, providing employment services, building consensus on emerging labour issues, putting in place effective labour inspection systems and promoting sound labour–management relations.
There is no doubt that the development of labour administration has been strongly influenced by international labour standards as embodied in the ILO Conventions and Recommendations.
The ILO has a long-standing commitment to strengthening labour ministries with the overall goal of enabling them to make significant inputs into broader economic and social policy-making as well as carrying out their regular functions with greater efficiency and impact.
Labour ministries are the main interlocutors between the ILO and the governments of its member States.
The ILO relies on the labour administration in each country, as well as the social partners, to highlight the importance of the ratification and implementation of international labour standards.
At the national level, the labour ministry has the main responsibility for ensuring that the social partners have a place in policy-making and are recognized by government as major interlocutors.
Today, the labour administration finds itself at the centre of the challenges and constraints resulting from the rapid changes affecting the world of work.
Labour administration is an important source of information in its fields of competence for government, employers and workers alike; it is an active intermediary in the prevention and settlement of labour disputes; it is an informed observer of the trends in society by virtue of its special links with the social partners; it is a provider of effective solutions to the evolving needs of its users.
It already bears responsibility for an increasing part of public expenditure; yet employers and workers are now calling for better resources for ministries of labour and labour inspectorates, to promote fairness and a “level playing field”, and to make decent work a reality.
A specific interest in good governance and compliance also means increasing expectations of labour ministries and inspectorates.
The World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalization (2004) asserted the importance of responding to globalization through good governance, emphasizing that “the behaviour of nation States as global actors is the essential determinant of the quality of global governance.
Their degree of commitment to multilateralism, universal values and common goals, the extent of their sensitivity to the cross-border impact of their policies, and the weight they attach to global solidarity are all vital determinants of the quality of global governance”.
Similarly, the 2008 ILO Declaration on Social Justice for a Fair Globalization reaffirmed the need to “strengthen the ILO’s capacity to assist its Members’ efforts to reach the ILO’s objectives in the context of globalization” and to promote “social dialogue and tripartism as the most appropriate methods for … making labour law and institutions effective, including in respect of the recognition of the employment relationship, the promotion of good industrial relations and the building of effective labour inspection systems” (ILO, 2008a).
Through its new Labour Administration and Inspection Programme (LAB/ADMIN), launched on 31 March 2009, the ILO pursues technical assistance and technical cooperation programmes with a view to assisting its constituents, in particular ministries of labour and labour administration/inspection systems, to play their crucial role in improving working conditions, ensuring compliance with labour legislation, preventing and settling labour disputes, promoting tripartism, working towards the transparency and fluidity of the labour market, modernizing employment services and developing adequate vocational training systems.
To perform these functions most effectively, labour administration/inspection systems and ministries of labour need regularly to review and adapt their actions and services; they also need to develop new forms of organization, management and intervention.
This new programme assists them by providing comparative information and advice based on ILO standards and international best practice.
In addition, it carries out its technical assistance and activities with a view to assisting labour administrations, including labour inspection systems and employment services, in the design and implementation of more effective policies and measures for the protection of workers and the improved functioning of labour markets.
It also ensures that labour inspection concerns are addressed in the Decent Work Country Programmes.
Within its mandate, and on the invitation of national governments, the Labour Administration and Inspection Programme conduct audits.
The findings and results of these audits are made available to the tripartite constituents with a view to raising awareness of current challenges and recommending possible solutions.
Action plans are then formulated in collaboration with the ministry of labour and the labour inspectorate of the country concerned.
2 strengthening labour inspectorates so that they are modern and effective, with adequate compliance mechanisms;
Against this background, the purpose of this volume is to spell out the main principles of labour administration, and the challenges facing it in implementing the Decent Work Agenda.
It describes ways in which these challenges can be met through policy, organization, coordination and management.
It also identifies some best practices in selected countries with well-performing labour administration systems.
It emphasizes the need for a professional approach to labour administration to ensure effective governance of the labour market.
It addresses labour administrators, labour inspectors, conciliators, employment service officials, governments, workers, employers, researchers and professionals.
I hope that this publication will bring the efficiency of labour administration to the forefront of the debate on good governance in the world of work.
The Constitutional provisions as well as the legal norms of the Law on International Treaties and norms of 22 June 1999 of the Labour Code 2002 mean that Lithuania’s legal system is based on the monistic approach that incorporates international treaties into the internal law.
According to Art.138 (3) of the Constitution the international treaties ratified by the Parliament (Seimas) shall be a constituent part of the legal system of the Republic of Lithuania.
In case of conflict, Art.11 (2) of the Law on International Treaties establishes the primacy of international agreements over national legal regulations, which means that the provisions of the treaties prevail in case of inconsistency with the national legal acts enacted either at the moment of the ratification of such treaty or convention or later.
Furthermore, the Labour Code of 2003 follows the same pattern and additionally establishes a possibility of direct application of international agreements in Lithuania.
According to Art.8 (1) of the Labour Code where the international agreements of the Republic of Lithuania establish rules other than those laid down by the Labour Code and other labour laws of the Republic of Lithuania, the rules laid down in international agreements shall be applied.
Art.8(2) of the Labour Code stipulates that the international agreements of the Republic of Lithuania shall be directly applied to labour relations except in cases when international agreements establish that the application thereof requires a special regulatory act of the Republic of Lithuania.
Of course, only self-executing provisions of the particular international agreement may be appropriate for direct application.
Right to adequate, safe and healthy working conditions (Art.48 (1);
Right of trade unions to function independently (Art.50 (1));
Equality of the trade unions rights (Art.50 (1));
Until 1990 the legal regulation of labour relations in Lithuania was distinguished by imperativeness peculiar to the Soviet legal system.
The basis of Lithuania’s labour laws was the soviet Labour Code adopted in 1972 and the allied laws that regulated almost all working conditions in details.
Almost no place was left for the regulation of working conditions by the means of collective and individual agreements.
Essential political economic and legal reforms started after the restoration of the independence of Lithuania in 1990.
Since 1990 the legal system has been reformed to meet the demands of the social and economic changes brought by the return to democracy and the free market economy system.
The detailed imperative regulation of labour relations hampered the formation of a labour market, the development of market relations.
Therefore, the reform of the national labour law was launched.
The main aim of the reform was to transfer from the centralised and all-covering state imperative regulation towards more liberal contract regulation allowing the parties of individual and especially of collective labour relations to determine the working conditions by themselves by the means of agreements.
The role of the state should be limited to set the minimum standards of labour rights and positions in one codified legal statement regulating labour relations – the new Labour code.
This task has been performed in a rather slow and contradictory way.
It should be emphasised that at the very beginning of the reform (in 1991 and in 1994) the new drafts of the Labour Code were prepared but they were not adopted.
The legislator chose another way pro tempore - to put aside the adoption of the Labour Code and start to enact separate laws regulating groups of the labour relations.
Thus, within a historically very short period of time, namely, several years, the most important labour laws were adopted:
These laws mostly kept the nature of a minimally corrected soviet regulation to correspond only to the basic market principles and to the changes of public life, which were inevitable at the time of transition from the soviet plan economy to free market.
The process of adopting new laws, then amending them many times, supplementing, trying to make explanations and instructions more detailed without thinking about their integrity and interrelations with other legal normative acts led to a situation where the legal norms of the separate statements contradicted and competed with each other.
Until 2003, entire institutions of the labour law such as individual labour disputes, labour discipline, and pecuniary liability were exceptionally regulated by the Labour Code of 1972 which, of course, did not correspond to the new economic relations.
The preparation of the third draft Labour Code was launched in 1998.
The new Labour Code had to solve many problems.
Some of them were related to the general base of Lithuania’s labour laws, for example, what should be the sphere regulated by labour law?
Should labour laws regulate the work of certain public servants, for example, in police and customs, as well as the work performance of self-employed persons or work based on membership in an enterprise, economic or agricultural association, etc, and to what extent?
Referring to Lithuania's goal to accede to the European Union, the Labour Code was also foreseen as an instrument of transposition of many EC labour law directives into the Lithuanian legal system.
The adoption of the third draft Labour Law took over three years.
After long-lasting discussions with social partners, NGO’s as well as discussions on the level of ministries, the draft Labour Code was presented to the Tripartite Council twice.
Finally, the Parliament (Seimas) adopted the Labour Code by Law No.
IX-926 (Valstybes žinios, 2002, No.
64-2569) on 4 June 2002.
The Labour Code entered into force on 1 January 2003.
Apart from the Law on Safety and Health of Employees of 7 October 1993 the Labour Code abolishes almost all labour laws adopted since 1990.
The Labour Code as a unified act regulates collective as well as individual labour relations, in particular, the scope, tasks and principles of the application of labour laws, the rights of trade unions and representatives of employees in the sphere of labour, the conclusion and implementation of collective agreements as well as the liability of the parties, the solution of collective labour disputes including strikes, legal grounds of employment, conclusion, terms and termination of contract of employment, minimum wage as well as the conditions of remuneration for work, working time and rest periods, safety and health of employees, vocational training and in-service training, labour discipline, conditions and limits of pecuniary liability, supervision of and control over compliance with the main labour laws.
According to Art.3 (1) of the Labour Code the sources of labour law are the Constitution of the Republic of Lithuania, international agreements of the Republic of Lithuania, the present Labour Code, other laws and regulations that are not contrary to the Code, as well as regulatory provisions of collective agreements.
The Administrative regulations play a rather supporting role in Lithuanian labour law.
According to the doctrine developed by the Constitutional Court the administrative regulations are designed to implement the laws but not to impose the duties on individuals.
The Labour Code follows this doctrine and sets strict pre-conditions and limits in order to minimise the possibility to regulate labour relations using administrative regulations:
“The Government resolutions and other regulations may regulate labour relations only in the cases and to the extent determined by this Code and other laws”.
(Art.3 of the Labour Code);
“The provisions of the regulations of the Government, other state and municipal institutions, establishing for the employees conditions less favourable than those established by this Code and other labour laws, shall be invalid.”
Collective agreements are a source of law in the Lithuanian legal system but their role is rather unessential.
Analysis of the greater part of Lithuanian labour law regulations allows to draw the conclusion that there are many provisions in the labour laws on the determination or concretisation of working conditions by collective agreement.
However, in practice the laws adopted by the state or individual contracts of employment, rather provisions of collective agreements, regulate labour conditions (remuneration, working hours, annual leave, conclusion and termination of contract of employment etc.).
It is universally accepted that the remuneration for work (except employees in the public sector) is dealt with in the contract of employment.
There is no official data but we can assume that there is a very small percentage (approx.
3-5 per cent) of enterprises having a valid collective bargaining agreement.
Art.
94 of the Labour Code defines an employment contract as an agreement between an employee and an employer whereby the employee undertakes to perform work of a certain profession, speciality, qualification or to perform specific duties in accordance with the work regulations established at the workplace, whereas the employer undertakes to provide the employee with the work specified in the contract, to pay him or her the agreed wage and to ensure working conditions as set in labour laws, other regulatory acts, the collective agreement and by agreement between the parties.
The parties to a contract of employment must agree on the following substantive terms: the employee's place of work (a company, branch etc.
), the work to be performed or position and remuneration.
The contract of employment may not establish the terms on working conditions that are less favourable to the employee than those provided by the Labour Code, laws, other regulatory acts and the collective agreement.
The law prohibits concluding a fixed-term contract of employment if the work is of permanent nature except in the cases when this is provided by laws or collective agreements.
A fixed-term contract of employment may be concluded for a certain period of time or for the period of the performance of certain work but not for more than 5 years.
A seasonal contract of employment shall be concluded for the performance of seasonal work that due to natural and climatic conditions is not performed all year round but during certain periods (seasons) not exceeding 8 months (in the period of 12 successive months) and is entered to the list of types of seasonal work.
A temporary contract of employment is a contract concluded for a period not exceeding 2 months.
The Government establishes the list of types of seasonal work, the circumstances under which a temporary employment contract may be concluded and other peculiarities of both types of contracts of employment.
If an employer recognises that the results of a probation to assess the suitability of an employee are unsatisfactory, he or she may dismiss the employee from work before the expiry of the probation period by giving the employee written notice thereof 3 days in advance without paying him or her a severance pay.
If probation is set to assess the suitability of work for an employee, the evaluation of the probation depends on the employee’s will.
The employee shall be entitled to terminate the employment contract during the probation period by giving the employer written notice thereof 3 days in advance.
If the employee continues working upon the expiry of the probation period, the termination of the employment contract shall be allowed only on general grounds.
During a trial period an employee shall be subject to all labour laws.
Until quite recently it was a distinctive feature of Lithuanian labour law that termination of the contract of employment was a complicated and troublesome procedure.
Traditionally in the system of soviet labour law the rights and interests of workers were strongly protected and the possibilities to dismiss an employee were restricted.
The main guarantee was the exhaustive list of narrow and detailed grounds (approx.
30) for the termination of an employment contract, subject to different procedures for each situation.
The Labour Code abolishes this regulation establishing only more general grounds and fixing additional guarantees to the certain groups of employees.
An employee may terminate a non-term contract of employment as well as a fixed-term employment contract prior to its expiry by giving the employer written notice thereof at least 14 days in advance.
In this case the employer must execute the termination of the employment contract and settle accounts with the employee.
Furthermore, guarantee against abuses is an entitlement to the employee to withdraw his or her request to terminate the employment contract not later than within 3 days of the submission of the request.
In some cases an employee may terminate a non-term contract of employment by giving the employer notice thereof at least 3 days in advance.
This is the case if the request to terminate the employment contract is justified by the employee’s illness or disability or where the employer fails to fulfil the obligations under the employment contract, laws or the collective agreement or there is long-lasting idle time at the employee’s workstation.
The same rule applies for the employee who is already entitled to the full old age pension or is in receipt thereof.
An employer shall be entitled to terminate an employment contract by giving the employee written notice 2 months in advance.
Employees who will be entitled to the full old age pension in not more than 5 years, persons under 18 years of age, disabled persons and employees raising children under 14 years must be given the notice of dismissal from work at least 4 months in advance.
During the period of notice the employer must grant the employee some time off from work to look for a new job.
The employee shall retain his or her average wage for this time.
Upon termination of a contract of employment at the initiative of the employer without any fault on the part of an employee with prior notice, the dismissed employee shall be paid a severance pay in the amount of his or her average monthly wage taking into account the continuous length of service of the employee concerned at that workplace: from 1 month average wage if the duration of employment is less than 12 months until 6 months average wage if the duration of employment is over 240 months (Art.
140 Labour Code).
According to Arts.144 (1) – 144 (3) of the Labour Code working time may not exceed 40 hours per week and the duration of daily working time must not exceed 8 working hours.
Maximum working time, including overtime, must not exceed 48 hours per 7 working days.
For employees employed in more than one workplace or having an additional job contract in the same workplace the daily working time (including breaks to rest and to eat) may not exceed 12 hours.
Generally overtime work is prohibited.
An employer may apply overtime work only in exceptional cases, e.g.
the work to be performed is necessary for national defence and for preventing accidents or danger, when work is necessary for the public, for elimination of unforeseen or accidental circumstances due to an accident, natural disasters, etc., when it is necessary to finish the work that could not have been finished during the working time because of an unforeseen or accidental obstacle, if interruption of work may result in the deterioration of production materials or breakdown of working equipment etc.
Work of administration officials exceeding the set working time duration shall not be deemed to be overtime work.
The list of such positions shall be laid down in collective agreements, internal regulations.
Overtime work can not be assigned: to persons under 18 years of age; to persons who are studying in secondary and vocational schools without interrupting work - on study days; when factors in the working environment exceed the permitted levels.
Disabled people may be assigned to overtime work provided that this is not forbidden by the conclusions of the commission that establishes disability.
Overtime work can be assigned only with their consent: to pregnant women, women who have recently given birth, women who breastfeed, employees who are raising a child under 3 years of age, are alone raising a child under 14 years of age or a disabled child under 16 years of age, as well as disabled persons.
The remuneration for overtime shall be at least one and a half of the hourly pay (monthly wages) established for the employee.
Extended annual holidays with pay up to 58 calendar days shall be granted to certain categories of employees whose work involves greater nervous, emotional and mental strain and professional risk as well as to those employees who work under specific working conditions.
The Government approved the list of categories of employees who are entitled to extended leave.
The list includes professions such as teachers, university professors, some categories of medical servants, fishermen, aviators and other related professions.
Additional annual holidays with pay are granted to employees for working conditions which are not in conformity with normal working conditions (i.e.
harmful or hazardous conditions), for a long uninterrupted employment at the same work place or for a special character of work (i.e.
work performed outdoor, on the road).
The
Government sets the duration of additional annual leave, the terms and conditions as well as the questions of procedure for granting leave.
Annual holidays with pay for the first working year shall be granted, as a rule, after 6 months of uninterrupted work at the enterprise.
For the second and the subsequent working years annual leave shall be granted at any time of the working year in accordance with the schedule of granting annual leave.
Annual holidays shall not be shortened for part-time employees.
Annual leave may, at the request of the employee, be taken in parts, but one part of annual leave may not be shorter than 14 calendar days.
Recall from annual holiday shall be permitted only on the employee's consent.
It is important to emphasise that minimum holiday may not be replaced by compensation in cash.
If the employee cannot be granted annual leave due to the termination of employment relationship or where the employee does not wish to go on leave, he or she shall be paid compensation in cash.
Compensation in cash for the unused annual leave shall be paid when the employment contract is terminated irrespective of its term.
Pregnant women, women who have recently given birth or breast-feeding women may not be assigned to perform work in the conditions that may be hazardous and affect the health of the woman or the child.
The employer must establish the nature and duration of potential risk which may affect the safety and health of the woman.
Upon assessment the employer must take necessary measures to ensure that the above risk is eliminated.
If after change of the working conditions it is not possible to avoid the woman’s exposure to risks the employer must transfer the employee (with her consent) to another job at the enterprise, institution or organisation.
In such case the employee shall not be paid less than the average wage she received before being transferred to another job.
If transferring a pregnant woman to another job where her and her expected child’s exposure to risks could be avoided is not technically feasible, the pregnant woman shall, with her consent, be granted a leave until she goes on her maternity leave and shall be paid during the period of extra leave her average monthly wage.
If it is not technically feasible to transfer a woman who has recently given birth or a breast-feeding woman after her maternity leave to another job where her or her child's exposure to risks could be avoided the woman shall, upon her consent, be granted an unpaid parental leave until her child is 12 months of age and shall be paid maternity social insurance benefits prescribed by the Law on Social Insurance of Sickness and Maternity during that period.
Assignation for overtime work upon their consent only (Art.150 (4) of the Labour Code);
Employees who have lost their functional capacity as a result of injury at work or occupational disease shall retain their work position until they recover their functional capacity, or disability is established.
Pursuant to Art.181 of the Labour Code employees shall be entitled to educational leave in order to prepare for and to pass the entrance examinations to colleges and higher educational institutions - three days for each examination.
The employees who are already studying at schools of general education or at colleges and higher educational institutions are entitled to educational leave subject to the certificate of the above institutions.
Travel time shall not be included in the period of educational leave.
The employees who are studying, taking entrance examinations to colleges and higher educational institutions under study contracts with their enterprise shall be entitled to a paid educational leave with pay at the rate of at least the average wage.
Pay for the period of study for employees who are taking examinations or are studying at their own initiative, shall be determined in the collective agreements or in the contract of employment.
The monthly wage of employees who are studying at educational institutions may not be less than the minimum monthly wage established by the Government.
Sabbatical leave shall be granted to complete a thesis, to write a textbook and in other cases provided by law.
Duration, procedure of granting and payment for sabbatical leave is regulated by law, the contract of employment or a collective agreement.
Employees elected to the body of a trade union functioning in an enterprise shall be granted a leave up to 6 working days per year to upgrade their qualifications, to attend various trade union events etc.
The procedure of granting leave and remuneration shall be stipulated in the collective agreement.
Normally a physical person shall acquire full legal capacity in labour relations and ability to acquire labour rights and undertake labour duties when he or she reaches the age of 16 years.
Nevertheless, the recruitment of persons under the age of 16 is allowed with written consent of the school and of one of the child’s parents or his or her statutory representative, as well as with permission of his or her attending paediatrician (Art.104 (3) of the Labour Code).
Moreover the persons under the age of 16 shall be assigned to perform easy works that are not hazardous and do not affect their physical and psychological development.
Upon employment of a person under the age of 16, employers are obliged to notify the Office of Labour Inspectorate on the fact of recruitment.
Work involving a higher risk of accidents or occupational diseases and work which a young person might not be able to perform safely due to lack of experience or attention to safety.
Assignation for overtime work, for a business trip, for stand-by duty at the enterprise or at home, to work during annual holidays upon their consent only;
Prohibition to discriminate on the ground of sex, race, nationality, religion, political opinion, trade union activity or age
Art.29 (1) of the Constitution declares the equality of all people before the law, the court, and other State institutions and officers.
Art.29 (2) states that a person may not have his or her rights restricted in any way or be granted any privileges on the basis of his or her sex, race, nationality, language, origin, social status, religion, convictions or opinions.
Following this constitutional provision the Labour Code lays down the principle of equality of all individuals.
The Labour Code broadens the list of grounds of prohibited discrimination establishing the equality irrespective of the gender, sexual orientation, race, nationality, language, origin, citizenship and social status, religion, marital and family status, age, convictions or opinions, membership in political party or public organisation as well as factors unrelated to the employee's professional qualities.
However, equality is postulated not as a legal norm of direct application but as the principle of regulation of labour relations.
According to Art.9 (4) of the Labour Code this principle shall be applied only when settling arising disputes if the relations are not regulated by labour laws and regulatory acts, and when the provisions of other branches of law that regulate similar relations are not applicable to them.
The Labour Code itself does not contain many norms of direct application, i.e.
Art.99 (1) of the Labour Code prohibits an employer to refuse to employ on the discriminatory grounds specified above.
According to Art.186 (3) of the Labour Code, men and women shall get equal pay for equal or equivalent work.
Art.188 (3) of the Labour Code states that when applying the work classification system for determining the wages, the same criteria shall be equally applied to both men and women and the system must be worked out in such a way as to avoid any discrimination on the grounds of sex.
If an employee loses a certain payment related to labour relations due to experienced discrimination, he or she has the right to appeal to the institution examining labour dispute and to demand to abolish or to change the discriminating legal norm or the agreement provision, to obligate to do a duty in kind, to recover experienced material damage.
Besides, in such case non-material damage can be recovered as well, the court determines the amount of it.
This question is one of the most difficult problems in the Lithuanian Labour Law.
It should be born in mind that traditionally Lithuanian laws provide many of guarantees to groups of employees of different age: minors, pensioners, employees who will be entitled to the full old age pension in not more than five years, etc.
They are justified by the need of greater protection or by the nature of work which shall be considered independently.
Prohibition of discrimination on the ground of the trade union membership
Despite the fact that there are not many legal norms of direct application prohibiting discrimination on the ground of trade union membership, such discrimination is precluded indirectly.
The court practise shows that each action of employers infringing normal relationship between the parties (i.e.
refusal to employ, suspension from work, imposing disciplinary measures, pecuniary liability, unilateral change of working conditions, dismissal from work) shall be justified by valid reasons.
The employer carries the burden of proof of the validity of reasons.
Art.188 (1) of the Labour Code stipulates that the conditions for determining the wages, rates, tariffs and qualification requirements for professions and positions, work quotas, the procedure of setting tariffs for work and the employees shall be laid down in the collective agreements.
Furthermore, specific pay on the hourly rate basis, monthly wages, other forms and conditions of remuneration for work, work requirements (output, time, service and other requirements) shall be laid down both in the collective agreements and the employment contracts.
However, in practise the wages are usually not fixed in the collective agreements but in the employment contracts.
Rather big enterprises having long traditions of collective bargaining or enterprises with dominating foreign investments are inclined to set wages and the conditions of remunerations in collective agreements.
But this is not the case in small and medium enterprises where the concrete wages are laid down in the employment contracts or the real wages are not revealed in order to avoid taxes.
Wages in the public sector are regulated by Government decree.
Normally it establishes the range (minimal and maximal wage or rate) for particular work performances and the head of administration has full discretion to concretise the exact remuneration for work in the contract of employment.
Nonetheless, the Labour Code lays down obligatory rules for determination of wages in case of work performed in extraordinary working conditions:
Overtime and night work shall be remunerated at least at the rate of one and a half of the established hourly pay (Art.193 (1) of the Labour Code);
Work on a rest day or a holiday that has not been provided for in the work schedule shall be paid at least at the double rate, if it was not compensated by granting the employee with another rest day during the month or by adding that day to his or her annual leave (Art.194 (1) of the Labour Code);
Work on a holiday that has been provided for in the work schedule shall be paid at least at double rate (Art.194 (2) of the Labour Code).
In case the wages or any other payments relating to employment relations are paid late because of the employer’s fault, except when bankruptcy proceedings are instituted towards the enterprise or when the bankruptcy procedure is used out of court, the employee shall also be paid default payments due to him or her under law.
However, the special Law on Establishing Default Payments in Labour Relations of 20 February 1996 foresees a very small rate of default payments – 0,06 per cent for one day of delay.
During the soviet period the system “one enterprise – one trade union” was introduced.
At that point, the system covered 90 percent of the enterprises and over 95 percent of the labour force were members of factually one official trade union.
After the restoration of independence in 1990 trade unions became independent.
The freedom to organise and the right to function independently was guaranteed by the Law on Trade Unions of 21 November 1991.
But today trade unions unite very small part of employees and the majority of employees do not belong to them.
After the restoration of independence the old soviet trade unions were destroyed and almost all valuable assets of the soviet trade unions were nationalised.
However, the creation and strengthening of new independent trade unions were not stimulated.
There is no impartial data available, but according to different estimations the number of unionised employees varies from 5 to 15 per cent of the entire labour force.
The trade unions tend to declare more impressive numbers of their members.
Currently, 3 independent trade union associations represent employees at the national level: the Lithuanian Trade Union Confederation (declares approx.
130 000 members), the Lithuanian Trade Union "Solidarumas” (declares approx.
80 000 members) and the Lithuanian Labour Federation (declares approx.
15 000 Members).
These organisations work in the same regions, sectors and even enterprises but they rather compete then work together.
Due to very weak trade union movement in Lithuania the employees lose the opportunity to bargain collectively in order to improve the minimum labour standards set by law, to go on strikes and to participate in decision-making processes of an enterprise.
The Labour Code introduces an additional possibility for workers’ representation through work councils but this system does not function yet.
According to Art.6 (1) of the Law on Trade Unions , trade unions may be established on the basis of professional, office, production, territorial or other principles determined by the trade unions themselves.
Several trade unions by their free choice and on their own initiative may unite in order to form a trade union association.
Art.41 of the Labour Code provides that social partnership may be developed on the national, sectoral (production, services, professional), territorial (municipality, county) levels or at the levels of enterprises, institutions and their structural subdivisions.
It means that trade unions may function at all possible levels – those of enterprise, territorial or sectoral but the law sets no uniform structure.
The Law lays down the material preconditions for establishment of a trade union - in order to establish a trade union the latter must have at least 30 founding members or its founding members must account for not less than 1/5 of all employees but in no case a trade union may be established by less than 3 employees.
The important feature of the trade unions movement in Lithuania is the fact that there exists a strong tradition to set up a trade union in each enterprise.
This is linked to the idea propagated by soviet labour law that each enterprise had to have its own organisational structure which directly participated in the relations with the employer of that very enterprise, concluded the enterprise agreement, expressed its opinion on various issues determined by the law representing not only its members but the whole collective of employees.
The Law on Trade Unions actually did not reform the previous trade union system.
This law orients trade unions activities towards a separate enterprise limiting the activities related to the territory of the enterprise and outside the enterprise while forming trade union federations and unifications.
The prevalence of this pattern indicates the fact that all national trade union organisations (like the Lithuanian Trade Union Confederation, the Lithuanian Trade Union "Solidarumas”) consist of territorial or sectoral trade unions that are simply associations uniting trade unions of enterprises.
This trade union structure mainly determines the structure of collective bargaining – normally it is enterprise oriented collective bargaining.
According to Art.8 of the Law on Trade Unions, in order to acquire the rights of a legal person, trade unions or their associations shall register their regulations (statute) at the municipality or the Ministry of Justice depending on the scope of their activity.
During a long period of time, the Supreme Court of Lithuania regarded this provision as the requirement sine qua non for each trade union to function and to represent the interest of the members and other employees.
However, the new Civil Code 2000 taking into scope the regulation of the establishment of legal persons changed the former approach.
Pursuant to Art.2.38 of the Civil Code trade unions shall be considered as the legal persons from the moment of their establishment.
The only duty they have is to inform the respective body of the municipality about their establishment.
When the trade union of an enterprise is established it has all rights to represent all employees of that enterprise and the employer has no right to refuse to recognise it.
Before the Civil Code of 2000 entered into force on 1 July 2001 the trade unions were obliged to register their regulations (statutes).
Refusal to register a trade union or association of trade unions was subject to appeal against in court that should investigate the case within 10 days according to the special procedure.
As far as the public authority is not entitled to register or recognise the trade union anymore - there is no remedy needed.
There is no such concept in national Lithuanian law.
The Labour Code prohibits to hinder the formation of trade unions by employees and to interfere with the lawful activities of the unions.
Furthermore, the Law on Trade Unions prohibits an employer or his or her authorised representative from making employment or retention of a job a condition of the employee’s consent to refrain from joining or to withdraw from a trade union.
The employer or his or her authorised representative is prohibited to organise and finance organisations seeking to hinder, terminate or control the activities of trade unions.
Trade unions may not be dissolved or suspended by an administrative order.
The Law stipulates that the rights and legitimate interests of trade unions and their members shall be defended in the manner established by the law, by the bodies of state power and governance, the court and other law enforcement bodies.
The State bodies, officials, natural or legal persons who inflict damage on a trade union by their unlawful actions must therefore compensate the trade union according to the procedure established by the Code of Civilian Procedure.
Lithuanian laws, which in great detail regulate trade unions activities, contain no special norms securing the legal status of the employers' organisations.
The Employers’ organisations may simply associate in accordance with the laws on NGO’s (public organisations or associations for general purposes).
Whereas employers' organisations under the Lithuanian laws act as associations of a general competence, they naturally fail to obtain per se the rights to represent their members in collective bargaining and to sign the agreements that are binding to the employer - member of the association.
Although employer’s organisations act quite actively in the social sphere (for instance, they are the Members of the Tripartite Council), they are not adapted to sign collective agreements.
The main problem is that their regulations do not stipulate any power of employers' representation in collective bargaining and concluding collective agreements.
Due to weakness of the trade union movement and the strict regulation on strikes (see Chapter 15) trade unions are not able to exercise pressure on employers in order to conclude collective agreements.
Collective bargaining in order to conclude a collective agreement is traditionally treated as a form of social partnership.
The legal framework of collective bargaining and conclusion of the collective agreements is established by the Labour Code.
Collective agreements may be concluded on the following levels:
The Labour Code contains no strict rules on the subject matters of collective agreements.
It just gives a non-exhaustive list of matters that may be regulated by collective agreements.
For example, the following may be specified in a collective agreement concluded at the national, sectoral or territorial level:
Procedure for amending and supplementing the collective agreement, period of validity, control of execution, liability for the violation of the agreement, etc.
The parties to a collective agreement of an enterprise shall lay down the following conditions in the agreement:
Provision of safe and healthy working conditions, granting compensatory allowances and privileges;
Procedure of implementation of the enterprise collective agreement;
However, collective agreements may regulate the position of employees only in favorem.
According to Art.4 (3) of the Labour Code, working conditions under which the position of employees is made less favourable than that established by the Labour Code, laws and other regulatory acts shall be invalid.
Parties to a national, sectoral or territorial collective agreement shall be correspondingly the central (national) trade union organisations and the employers' organisations, the trade union and employers’ organisations of the appropriate sector of industry (production, services, profession), trade union and employers’ organisations acting on the specified territory (municipality, county).
Following the soviet labour law tradition and as distinct from the parties to a national, sectoral or territorial collective agreement the Labour Code states that a party to a collective agreement of an enterprise is the “collective of employees of the enterprise”.
The collective of employees is not a legal or physical person and cannot exercise the right to conclude an agreement independently on its own.
This misleading regulation was not changed in the Labour Code arguing that the collective of employees is able to exercise this right through its representatives – trade unions.
That is why Art.60 (1) of the Labour Code establishes that the collective shall be represented for the purposes of conclusion of the agreement by the trade union acting in the enterprise.
The problems appear when several different enterprise-level trade unions act in the same enterprise.
This situation can be solved in two ways: either all trade unions that have the right to negotiate the collective agreement agree to form a joint representation of trade unions, or, if the trade unions fail to reach an agreement on the formation of a joint representation the decision on the representation shall be adopted by the meeting (conference) of the employees.
A trade union that gets a majority of votes of the employees participating in the meeting (conference) has the right to negotiate and to conclude an agreement on behalf of all employees of the enterprise.
If there is no acting trade union in the enterprise, the meeting of the collective of the employees may transfer the right to negotiate and to conclude the agreement on behalf of all employees of the enterprise to the sectoral trade union.
If this is not the case, a work council elected by secret ballot at the general meeting of the collective of employees has the right to negotiate and to conclude the agreement.
The Labour Code establishes the general principles of collective bargaining procedures but the legal norms regulating the different types of collective agreement contain some special provisions.
Furthermore the Labour Code entitles parties to the collective agreement and their representatives with the right to demand from the other party to submit information on all issues relating to bargaining.
This information must be presented within 1 month from the day it was requested unless otherwise agreed by the parties.
The parties to the agreement shall determine other procedural questions like time limits for drawing up, signing, supplementing and amending a collective agreement as well as other related issues.
But the law is more imperative and detailed describing the procedure of collective bargaining and the conclusion of the collective agreement of an enterprise.
The main requirement is laid down in Art.62 (4) of the Labour Code according to which the draft collective agreement of the enterprise approved by the parties shall be submitted to the employees' meeting (conference).
The trade union or other representative of the collective of employees and the employer shall sign the draft collective agreement of the enterprise only if the meeting (conference) of the employees approves the agreement.
If the meeting (conference) does not approve the submitted draft it will decide either to resume the bargaining or to initiate a collective labour dispute.
Extending the binding effects of collective agreements
It is generally accepted that collective agreements are binding to the parties.
The obligatory character of the agreements is apparent from the principles of the Lithuanian labour Law, which are laid down in the Code:
Liability of the parties to the collective agreement for their obligations (Art.2 (1) of the Labour Code);
Actual fulfilment of the obligations of social partners (Art.40 (2) of the Labour Code).
Under the former Soviet regime, the collective agreement was usually applied to all employees of the enterprise irrespectively of their membership in the trade union.
The Labour Code follows this same pattern (Art.59 of the Labour Code) and extends the application of this principle to the national, sectoral and territorial agreements as well.
Pursuant to Art.52 (1) of the Labour Code a national, sectoral and territorial collective agreement shall be applied in the enterprises where employers were members of the associations of employers which signed the agreement, or joined the employers’ associations after the signing of the agreement.
For the first time in the Lithuanian labour law history the Labour Code introduced the basic provisions on extension of the sectoral, territorial collective agreement erga omnes.
According to Art.52 (2) of the Labour Code the Minister of social security and labour may extend the scope of application of the sectoral and territorial collective agreement or separate provisions thereof by administrative law enactment establishing that the agreement shall be applied with respect to the entire sector, profession, sphere of services or a certain territory.
This may happen if one or several employees' or employers' organisations that are parties to the sectoral or territorial collective agreement submit an appropriate request, and the Minister is of the opinion that the provisions of a sectoral or territorial agreement have consequences on a sector of production or profession.
The Labour Code expressly describes the solution of collisions between several different collective agreements concluded at the national, sectoral, territorial levels.
However, this same rule shall be applied to the possible collisions between the national, sectoral, territorial agreements and the enterprise agreements as well collisions between several collective agreements of an enterprise.
The general rule can be formulated as follows: when several collective agreements are applicable in an enterprise the provisions of the agreement that provide for more favourable conditions for the employees shall apply.
A national, sectoral and territorial agreement shall be subject to registration upon application at the Ministry of Social Security and Labour.
This type of agreement enters into force from the day of its registration and is valid until the day specified therein or until the conclusion of a new national, sectoral or territorial collective agreement.
A collective agreement of an enterprise enters into force upon its signing, unless otherwise established in the agreement.
This type of collective agreement is valid until the signing of a new collective agreement of the enterprise or until the deadline set in the agreement.
When a fixed-term collective agreement of the enterprise has been concluded the parties shall start negotiations for its renewal 2 months before the termination of its validity.
If an enterprise files a petition for bankruptcy or initiates performance of extra judicial bankruptcy procedure, the validity of the collective agreement of the enterprise is suspended.
The collective agreement of an enterprise may be terminated in the cases and according to the procedure specified in the agreement by any party after giving at least a three-month advance notice to the other party.
Termination of a collective agreement of an enterprise before the lapse of a six months period after the coming into force of the agreement shall be prohibited.
As in many post-soviet countries, employees’ representation through trade unions is one of the distinguishing features of the national labour law.
Traditionally, the representatives of the employees of an enterprise locally organise trade unions of that particular enterprise.
During the soviet era there was only one trade union organisation functioning in an enterprise, which was entitled to conduct collective bargaining and participate in governing the enterprise.
After 1990 the main principle of this type of representation was sustained.
The sole representative of employees of an enterprise was the enterprise level trade unions, which were granted the exclusive rights to bargain collectively, to conclude collective agreements, to call a strike.
According to the Labour Code, the trade union of an enterprise shall represent and protect interests of all employees of that particular enterprise.
In case there is no functioning trade union in the enterprise, the collective of employees may transfer the function of employees’ representation and protection to the trade union of the appropriate sector of economic activity.
Lastly, if there is no functioning trade union in an enterprise and the function of representation was not transferred to the sectoral trade union, employees shall be represented by the work council.
The status of work councils and the procedure of their formation shall be established by law.
The Labour Code stipulates that a works council shall be elected by secret ballot at the general meeting of the collective of employees (Art.19 (1) of the Labour Code) and that the work council may not perform functions recognised under the laws as the prerogative of trade unions (Art.21 (3) of the Labour Code).
When exercising the competence of representation, the trade union of an enterprise, sectoral trade union or work council are called the representatives of employees in the Labour Code.
Pursuant to Article 22 of the Labour Code the representatives of the employees shall have the following main rights of collective representation:
To conclude collective agreements, supervise the implementation thereof;
To submit proposals to the employer on the organisation of work at the enterprise;
To exercise non-state supervision and control of compliance with the labour laws;
The Labour Code does not enumerate the main obligations of workers’ representatives.
However, the principles of labour law may play the role here: while exercising their rights and fulfilling their obligations, employers, employees and their representatives are bound to comply with the laws, observe the rules of communal life and adhere to the principles of reasonableness, justice and honesty.
Collective labour disputes are regulated by Chapter X of the Labour Code .
Article 68 of the Labour Code defines a collective labour dispute as “disagreements between the trade union of an enterprise and the employer or the subjects entitled to conclude collective agreements, arising about the establishment or changing of work, social and economic conditions when conducting the negotiations or when concluding and implementing the collective agreement (conflict of interests), in case of failure to meet the demands made and submitted by the parties according to the procedure established by this Code.
The hearing of a dispute in the Conciliation Commission is a mandatory stage within a collective dispute resolution.
It is described in articles 72 to 74 of the Code.
The Conciliation Commission shall be formed of an equal number of authorised representatives of the parties to the collective bargaining.
The Conciliation Commission shall hear the collective dispute within 7 days from the day of the formation of the Conciliation Commission.
The employer must provide the Conciliation Commission with the necessary working conditions: assign premises and provide the necessary information.
The decisions of the Conciliation Commission shall be adopted by agreement between the parties, executed by drawing up a record and must be implemented by the parties within the time limit and according to the procedure specified in the decision.
If the Conciliation Commission fails to reach an agreement on all or a part of the demands, the Commission may refer them for hearing to the Labour Arbitration, Third Party Court or wind up the conciliation proceeding by drawing up a Protocol of Disagreement.
The decision of the Conciliation Commission shall be announced to the employees.
The Labour Arbitration shall be formed ad hoc under the court district which has jurisdiction over the entity (employer’s organisation or trade union) which made the demands in the collective dispute.
It consists of 6 appointed impartial arbitrators and one judge of the district court.
The Third Party Court is formed ad hoc upon the written agreement of arbitrators appointed by each party.
The Labour Arbitration and the Third Party Court take decisions by majority vote of the arbitrators.
It shall be underlined that the resolution of collective labour disputes before the Labour Arbitration and the Third Party Court is an alternative and optional stage of disputes.
Despite the fact that the law establishes the binding character of the decision upon the parties, the decisions cannot lay down rights or obligations of individuals and are not enforceable by the courts.
If employers or their organisations do not implement the decision of the Labour Arbitration or the Third Party Court, the only sanction left is the “green light” to start the industrial action.
According to Art.51 (2) of the Constitution the law shall establish the restrictions of the right to strike, the conditions and procedures for the implementation of this right.
That is why strikes in Lithuania are regulated by law and not case law.
Parties of collective agreements are reluctant to introduce rules on industrial actions into collective agreements.
The Lithuanian labour law system is distinguished by a relatively restricted possibility to take industrial action.
The previous Law on the Regulation of Collective Disputes as well as the Labour Code provide for a rather detailed, long and complicated compulsory pre-strike procedure in an enterprise.
The Law requires the organisers of the strike to have the support of the majority of employees of the enterprise, which is difficult to achieve in practice.
That is why, since the first national regulations on strikes of 1992 were adopted, there has been very few lawful strike actions taken in Lithuania.
One of the obstacles for strike actions at a level higher than the enterprise seems to be the lack of special rules concerning strikes at sectoral, territorial or national level.
Such strikes are legally interconnected with strikes in enterprises.
It means that from the formal point of view the sectoral trade union willing to declare a strike in any branch must arrange separate strike actions in every enterprise of the branch concerned.
This requires the support of the majority of all employees working in all enterprises where the strike is to be announced.
The next feature of the Lithuanian system is the nature of the demands of trade unions.
The majority of strikes in Lithuania have related to purely legal conflicts (mostly, demands to pay wages according the employment contracts or collective agreements or pay them in time) when quite few of them have concerned collective bargaining issues (such as the rise of wages, extension of paid annual holiday etc.
).
The person who is entitled to conclude collective agreements - the trade union of the enterprise or the joint representation of trade unions, sectoral, territorial trade union or trade unions organisations may submit the demands to an employer or an employers’ organisation.
In principle all trade union organisations are entitled to call a strike.
As it was noted under certain circumstances the work councils are entitled to conclude collective bargaining agreements as well.
However, according to the Labour Code the work councils may submit demands to the employer but they are not entitled to call a strike.
This illogical regulation aims to distinguish the competences of the trade unions and work councils in an enterprise and to grant, as it is argued, the trade unions with some exclusive rights.
First of all, the entity who is entitled to conclude a collective agreement shall submit demands to an employer or employers’ organisation (see above).
The employer or employers’ organisation shall communicate the decision in written form to the trade union or work council within 7 days from the receipt of demands.
If the employer or employers’ organisation refuses to fulfil the demands of trade unions, the parties to collective bargaining have to start either conciliation procedures or mediation procedures.
When a strike is declared then only the demands that were not met during the conciliation procedure may be put forward.
The right to take the decision to declare a strike (including a warning strike) shall be vested in the trade union according to the procedure laid down in its regulations.
Pursuant to Article 77 of the Labour Code, a strike shall be declared if the corresponding decision is approved by secret ballot:
The Labour Code prohibits declaring a strike during the term of validity of the collective agreement if the agreement is complied with.
The problematic issue here is that the legislator does not concretise what collective agreement shall be taken into consideration in this regard: that of an enterprise, sectoral or territorial?
Shall this be the collective agreement between all the parties participating in collective labour dispute involved?
Fulfilment of the above conditions shall be ensured by the trade union leading the strike, the employer and the employees appointed by them.
In case of failure to ensure minimum services, the Government or the executive institution of the municipality may enlist for the purpose the aid of other services.
The body leading a strike is bound to ensure together with the employer safety of people and property.
In this respect trade unions do not have any other obligations apart the obligation to ensure the minimum services.
However, the law imposes obligations to the employer by enumerating the prohibited actions to the employer upon the declaration of a strike.
After the decision has been taken to declare a strike and during the strike the employer shall be prohibited from:
When a strike is declared the employer or employer organisation may apply to the court with a petition to declare the strike unlawful.
In case of an unlawful strike the losses incurred by the employer must be compensated by the trade union with its own funds or from its assets.
If the funds of the trade union prove insufficient to compensate the losses, by his or her decision the employer may use the funds set aside under the collective agreement for the payment of pay additional to the wage to the employees, other additional privilege pays and compensatory allowances not provided for by laws.
The Labour Code does not make clear statement on individual pecuniary liability of the striking employees.
However, in some court cases the trade unions activists were subject to personal pecuniary liability for the damages inflicted by the strike because they called on apparently “wild cat action”.
Pursuant to Article 285 of the Labour Code, an individual labour dispute is understood as a disagreement between the employee and the employer regarding the exercise of the rights and fulfilment of the obligations established in the labour laws, regulatory acts, employment contract or collective agreement.
These disputes shall be considered according to the procedure laid down in the Labour Code as well in the Code of Civilian Procedure.
Traditionally the Lithuanian labour law tries to implement the principle that individual labour disputes shall be resolved in situ - at an enterprise or in the structural subdivision of an enterprise, where the dispute comes up.
Pursuant to Art.289 of the Labour Code, the Labour Disputes Commission shall be the mandatory primary body for dispute resolution, unless the Labour Code or other laws establish other dispute resolution procedures.
To this end the Labour Code determines the principles of formation of the Labour Disputes Commission of an enterprise, its competences and the decision taking procedure of the Commission.
Furthermore, the Labour Code indicates the cases when the disputes shall be resolved directly in the courts of general jurisdiction.
As it was stressed above the system of labour courts does not exist in Lithuania so far.
An employee may apply to the Labour Disputes Commission within 3 months from the day when he or she found out or ought to have found out about the violation of his or her rights.
The employer is not entitled to initiate the labour disputes at the Labour Disputes Commission.
If the Labour Disputes Commission has not been formed in an enterprise, upon receiving the application the employer must promptly appoint the clerk of the Labour Disputes Commission and initiate the formation of the Commission.
The Labour Disputes Commissions shall be formed by an equal number of representatives of the employees and the employer.
The meeting (conference) of the employees elects the employees' representatives to the Commission.
The Commission shall be formed for a term of up to 2 years.
The clerk of the Labour Disputes Commission does all the preparation work for hearing the case in the Labour Disputes Commission.
The Labour Disputes Commission shall consider the application of the employee within 14 days from the day of filing.
The decisions of the Labour Disputes Commission shall be passed by agreement between the representatives of the employees and the employer - members of the Labour Disputes Commission.
The employer is bound to execute the decision of the Labour Disputes Commission within 10 days from the day of the decision receipt, unless he or she has appealed against it to the court.
In case of failure to execute the decision the employee shall apply to the court with the written request for the enforcement of the decision according to the procedure established for the execution of court decision.
The Code of Civilian Procedures of 28 February 2002 contains a chapter laying down the peculiarities of resolving labour disputes in courts of general jurisdiction.
Generally speaking, in labour cases the court has very wide discretion and can on its own initiative collect evidence, involve third parties in the procedures, exceed the demands of the claimants or apply the alternative means of protection of the infringed rights.
The Code of Civilian Procedures sets short-time terms for the preparation and hearing of labour cases in courts of general jurisdiction.
The case shall be prepared in 30 days for hearings and the decision shall be taken not later than 30 days after the beginning of the hearings.
It shall be distinguished between appeals against decisions of the Labour Disputes Commission and appeals against decisions of local courts.
If the labour dispute is to be heard directly in court without applying to the Labour Disputes Commission, the decision of the court is subject to appeal to the district court within 30 days according to the procedure established by the Code of Civilian Procedures.
The effective decisions of the district court are then subject to revision in the Supreme Court.
The decisions of the Labour Disputes Commission are subject to appeal to the court within 10 days from the receipt thereof.
The decision of the Labour Disputes Commission shall not be subject to appeal by the employer.
The decision of the court is then subject to appeal to the district court according to the procedure established by the Code of Civilian Procedures.
The effective decisions of the district court are subject for revising in the Supreme Court.

1.
Owing to their global nature, the footwear, leather, textiles and clothing (TCF) industries are highly influenced by the pressure of international competition.
This pressure has an impact on the viability of enterprises and influences labour practices.
In this context, therefore, developments in labour practices should adopt an innovative approach by taking into account the social dimensions of globalization and strive for improvements in the competitiveness of enterprises, stable employment and better working conditions.
2.
The TCF industries play an important role in the world economy.
They generate large flows of trade, are a major creator of employment and substantially contribute to the initial stages of the process of industrialization in many developing countries.
Over the last 20 years the TCF industries have undergone major changes.
Large distribution groups, which have sometimes taken the place of traditional producers, have emerged; there has been a trend towards national and international contracting and subcontracting; and there have been waves of relocations, notably in the clothing industry, in response to changes in the criteria governing international competitiveness.
These factors influence the global landscape in which TCF industries operate and, as a consequence, the development of working practices.
In view of the mixed results of globalization, the effective implementation of core labour standards should be taken to ensure that the advantages of globalization are fairly distributed to the benefit of all.
Efforts should also be made to assist those developing countries and economies in transition which suffer as a result of the growing international competitiveness in the TCF industries.
6.
Child labour and its exploitation are flagrant human rights violations which thwart the principles of social justice.
While significant progress has been made in the past 20 years in child labour legislation worldwide, and more recently in formal sector enterprises, child labour continues to be a problem in the TCF industries in some countries.
Child labour deprives children of an education and the right to childhood.
Child labour is a source of unfair competition with negative impacts on employment security and the wages of adult workers.
7.
All member States should ratify and fully enforce all relevant international Conventions, in particular the ILO Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (No.
182), and the Minimum Age Convention, 1973 (No.
138). New awareness campaigns on the issue of child labour should be launched along with drives to promote the universal ratification of these two Conventions.
In countries where child labour occurs, governments should earmark additional funds to improve the education system and tighten supervision of compulsory school attendance by children working in the formal and informal sectors.
Further, they should - with the ILO's support - take action to: enhance labour education programmes; make labour inspection more effective; use social dialogue to combat child labour; and increase awareness among the public at large.
8.
Programmes should be set up within TCF enterprises, with the support of the ILO and the social partners, to prevent the recruitment and employment of children and to make sure that the displaced children are given the opportunity to attend school.
To encourage children's school attendance, a range of measures is needed to ensure that family income is maintained.
Additionally, these programmes should involve the removal of children from hazardous working conditions and of children below the minimum age as defined in Convention No.
138. These programmes should be conducted in close cooperation with the ILO and its International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC).
9.
The majority of workers in TCF industries are women.
They are the ones who contribute most actively to the stability of these industries in the long term.
In order to secure equal opportunity, governments should facilitate equal access to education, literacy programmes and training, including in traditionally male jobs, and TCF industry employers should enhance their human resource development and training policies, particularly with regard to women.
A large number of women workers are in the informal sector and social security funds should be formed for these workers.
Employers should strive to ensure access to a broader range of career choices for women through training as well as through the provision of equal opportunities and equal pay for work of equal value.
They should ensure access by women workers to all levels of training and various other benefits.
Candidates for employment or promotion should be chosen on the basis of skills and ability, not gender.
Particular emphasis should be given to facilitating women's opportunities with regard to equal access to skilled jobs.
11.
Steps should be taken at national and international levels, by governments and social partners, in close cooperation with the ILO, to make the relevant parties more aware of gender issues, provide training on workers' rights, and promote the ratification and full enforcement of relevant international conventions and the decisions taken at international conferences on the topic (Platform for Action of the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, 1995, and measures approved by UN Special Session Beijing+5).
Women workers, including those from the informal sector, need to have a voice in negotiations at all levels.
12.
Migrant workers constitute an important part of the TCF workforce in industrialized countries and those developing countries which have progressed furthest along the road to industrialization.
As migrant workers tend to face difficulties because of inappropriate types of education, language difficulties, administrative measures and social integration, they may suffer discriminatory labour practices.
It is the responsibility of the social partners, with the support of the competent authorities, to ensure that migrant workers can fully integrate into the activities of TCF enterprises without discrimination and have access to the training necessary for their optimal participation in all production activities.
Activities by employers and governments should combat racial and religious discrimination that migrant workers often face.
Special language courses should be set up for migrant workers by governments and the social partners to improve access to and completion of training, retraining and education.
In accordance with national laws and the provisions of the relevant ILO Conventions, all appropriate measures should be taken to ensure that the special needs of migrant workers are duly taken into consideration.
13.
In some parts of the world, the past several years have seen a growth in home work in the TCF industries as markets demand increasing flexibility on the part of enterprises.
In many countries, homeworkers, most of whom are women but may also include child workers, enjoy no recognized legal status and, as a result, they are susceptible to a range of abusive labour practices.
They thus deserve special attention as well as legal and social protection.
Their working conditions are a source of concern to governments and workers' and employers' organizations.
14.
Homeworkers should benefit from the full application of all applicable labour laws.
Measures are required to bring the wages and conditions of homeworkers into line with other wage earners in the sector; to regulate the responsibilities of intermediaries; to ensure a system of inspection; and to adopt means to elaborate labour statistics on home work.
15.
Steps should be taken to strengthen measures to combat clandestine workshops.
They represent unfair competition for legally registered enterprises.
They subject the workers to intolerable abuses, often practise forced labour, and operate outside the law.
The initiatives taken by governments to help to eradicate those illegal production facilities should continue to receive the unconditional support of employers' and workers' organizations and relevant NGOs.
Only the law and effective tripartite coordination at the national level, along with public education campaigns, will make it possible to put an end to these activities, which is prejudicial to workers as a whole, and to the public image of the TCF industries.
Merchants, retailers and marketers must use their power and responsibility to prevent the use of clandestine work in the production of their products.
16.
Appropriate regulatory and promotional measures to eliminate debt bondage should be taken and their application strengthened in countries in which it continues to be practised.
The abolition of bonded labour and indentured servitude is one of the priorities of the ILO as set out in the ILO Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (No.
182), together with the Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (No.
29), and the Abolition of Forced Labour Convention, 1957 (No.
105). The employers' and workers' organizations of the TCF industries should cooperate with the governments concerned in these efforts.
17.
In order to prevent excessively long working hours, the number and schedule of overtime hours worked and payment for overtime should always comply with the provisions of national laws or collective agreements and there should be stricter control of the regulatory measures.
19.
Member States should ratify and enforce the relevant international labour standards, in particular the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No.
87), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No.
98), and promote the strengthening of social dialogue at the appropriate levels.
The ILO, in collaboration with the social partners, should support activities aimed at promoting social dialogue in TCF industries, particularly in countries where the framework for such dialogue is not developed.
Collective bargaining can take many different forms and may be based on national, sectoral, enterprise or other forms of agreement.
In all countries, workers' representatives should enjoy the freedom to bargain with their employers on salaries and working conditions.
The informal sector also needs a voice on these matters.
Setting up a harmonious labour relations system based on the application of the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining is vital for the economic development of TCF activities in export processing zones and for improving the conditions of workers.
The social partners should seek to ensure that the principles embodied in the ILO Declaration are upheld.
Governments, in cooperation with the social partners, should ensure that national labour laws and all core ILO Conventions are enforced fully in enterprises in these zones.
24.
To enhance the effectiveness of training and retraining programmes made necessary by the introduction of new technologies, and to bring the effects of staff reduction to a minimum, cooperation and social dialogue between the social partners should be developed on these issues.
Governments should provide quality basic education and, in cooperation with the social partners, institutional training in tune with the changing needs of TCF industries.
They should also offer incentives to enterprises to expand initial and continuing training programmes.
Special support should be given to small and medium-sized enterprises by their governments.
25.
Training and retraining programmes in TCF industries should be designed by all the parties concerned and should prepare workers for change, offer them transferable qualifications, and improve occupational safety and health and working conditions.
27.
In accordance with the strategic objectives set by the International Labour Conference, the ILO should focus primarily on promoting and strengthening sectoral social dialogue, particularly in TCF industries.
ILO activities in the following areas - economic development, the informal sector, the employment impact of technological change, child labour, promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises, training, health and safety, improvement of social protection and women's occupational status, in the overall context of decent work - can bring concrete advantages to TCF industry enterprises and workers.
A sectoral approach would reinforce their impact.
If appropriate, meetings of experts and regional or subregional meetings to address these issues could be held.
29.
The ILO should pursue its research programmes on the impact of voluntary codes of conduct in TCF industries, homeworkers, export processing zones and multinational enterprises.
It should also develop research projects on the impact of the trade in second-hand clothes on employment and working conditions in TCF industries and undertake a study on the social implications of hours of work.
For the purpose of this Convention, the term "workers' representatives" means person who are recognized as such under national law or practice, whether they are: (a) trade union representatives, namely, representatives designated or elected by trade unions or by the members of such unions; or (b) elected representatives, namely, representatives who are freely elected by the workers of the undertaking in accordance with the provisions of national laws or regulations or of collective agreements and whose functions do not include activities which are recognized as the exclusive prerogative of trade unions in the country concerned.
The Constitution of Trinidad and Tobago recognizes and guarantees citizens certain basic human rights and freedoms, such as the right to life, liberty and security, the right to equality before the law and the right to freedom of expression.
The right to freedom of association and assembly is also a fundamental right protected by the Constitution.
This right translates into the right of a person to form and join a trade union or association.
There is no constitutional right to bargain collectively or to strike, (Collymore and Another v. The Attorney General (1969) 15 WIR 229 .
The Industrial Relations Act (hereinafter referred to as the IRA) does however make provisions for collective bargaining between employers and workers and allows industrial action, including strike action, once taken in accordance with the IRA.
A list of trade unions established in the country is available in the webpage of the ILO Subregional Office for the English Speaking Caribbean countries.
Employers also have the right to form and join their own associations.
In Trinidad and Tobago the main employers' association is the Employers' Consultative Association .
The general industrial relations policy in Trinidad and Tobago is based on voluntary collective bargaining between employers and workers, via their representative associations, for the settlement of terms and conditions of employment.
The employment relationship in Trinidad and Tobago may be governed by either or a combination of both industrial relations principles and practices, and legislation.
While the Government has ratified several ILO Conventions, including the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention, 1976 (No.
144), these Conventions only become effective when they are legislatively implemented.
A 144 Tripartite Committee, comprising all of the social partners, trade unions, employers, and Government, is in operation in Trinidad and Tobago with the responsibility of considering and recommending the ratification of ILO Conventions.
State employees include civil servants, teachers and members of the Protective Services (Fire, Police and Prison Services).
The employment relationship between the State and its employees is governed generally by legislation, which makes provisions for terms and conditions of employment including recruitment, hours of work, leave entitlements, payment of remuneration, pensions, allowances and other benefits.
There is legislation which deals specifically with each group, such as the Civil Service Act, Chap 23:01 for all civil servants, the Police Service Act, Chap.
15:01, as revised by the Police Service Bill (2003) , the Fire Service Act, Chap.
35:50 and the Education Act, Chap 39:01 for teachers.
The representative associations of monthly paid State employees may bargain collectively with the Chief Personnel Officer, who is deemed to be the employer of State employees under the IRA.
The subject of these negotiations include wage increases, travelling and other allowances and leave entitlements.
When agreement is reached on a matter the parties enter into a Memorandum of Agreement.
Where this Memorandum affects existing legislation, the legislation is accordingly amended to give effect to the agreed position.
The terms and conditions of employment of daily paid State employees are contained in collective agreements entered into by their recognized majority union and the Chief Personnel Officer after collective bargaining.
In the private sector collective bargaining is generally engaged between individual companies with the respective recognized majority unions, rather than on an industry wide basis.
Many companies have industrial relations or human resources managers who handle negotiations.
Companies which do not have industrial relations professionals may hire private negotiators or practitioners to conduct negotiations on their behalf.
Trade unions have negotiators on their staff.
Those aspects of the employment relationship which could not be left to collective bargaining such as employee health and safety, minimum age of employment and workers' compensation, retrenchment and severance benefits and maternity leave are set down in legislation which bind the State and private employers.
The Factories Ordinance (soon to be replaced by the Occupational Safety and Health Act , assented on 30 January 2004, but still awaiting proclamation, and the Employment Injury and Disability Benefits Bill ) sets standards for employee health and safety at the workplace.
The Workmen's Compensation Act, to be replaced by the Employment Injury and Disability Benefits Bill provides compensation where employees are injured on the job, while the Retrenchment and Severance Benefits Act guarantees the payment of severance pay to retrenched employees.
The Maternity Protection Act provides maternity leave and related benefits to female employees.
The Government has also recognized the need to implement legislation which sets minimum terms and conditions of employment so that employees are guaranteed a basic level of rights and protection.
The IRA sets the stage for the practice of industrial relations in Trinidad and Tobago.
It is the legal framework within which parties bargain collectively, settle disputes and come before the Industrial Court for arbitration.
During the 1950s and early 1960s the industrial relations climate in Trinidad and Tobago was growing tense with the development of the trade union movement.
There was an increasing number of strikes and labour disputes which threatened the economic growth and productivity of the country.
The Government could no longer delay in taking legislative action to regulate the relations between unions, workers and employers.
As a result the Industrial Stabilisation Act, 1965, was enacted.
This Act introduced the concept of compulsory arbitration to Trinidad and Tobago by the establishment of the Industrial Court.
The main function of this Court was to intervene to prevent and settle industrial disputes between employers and their union represented workers.
the recognition and registration of trade unions,
the freedom to be represented by a trade union and the right not to associate, and
any such person who has ceased to work as a result of a lockout or of a strike, whether or not in contravention of Part 5,
When a person makes a claim under any piece of labour legislation that provides rights and benefits for workers, the Industrial Court will first decide whether the person falls within the definition of 'worker' or 'employee' in the particular Act.
The approach of the Court when determining this question was stated in the case of Oilfields Workers' Trade Union and Schlumberger Trinidad Inc. RSBD No.
4 of 1996,
The terms and conditions under which an employee works may be contained in an individual contract of employment between the employee and employer, a collective agreement negotiated by the representative trade union or employee association with the employer or by legislation as is the case with State employees.
Because employers may be tempted to use contract labour to escape statutory entitlements of workers and obligations imposed by collective agreements, the Industrial Court has had to look beyond the fixed term contract and the claim of independent contractor to discover the reality of the relationship.
This occurred in the Schlumberger case (supra), where the company claimed that since the worker, who was employed for a period in excess of ten years on consecutive six month contracts, was employed on a fixed term basis, he did not fall within the definition of ‘worker' in the Retrenchment and Severance Benefits Act, and was therefore not entitled to severance payment.
The Court held that neither the worker nor the employer could contract out of the Act and found that the worker was in continuous employment with the Company despite the six month contracts and was thereby entitled to severance pay.
The practice of employment on a fixed term basis has not found favor with the trade unions.
Since fixed term contracts are usually negotiated by the individual worker with the employer, there is no collective bargaining process and the role of the union is ousted.
Most workers under a fixed term contract are not unionized.
More needs to be done on the part of trade unions to attract persons who work on a fixed term contract basis.
These persons include not only construction workers and workers in labour intensive industries, but a growing number of professionals.
Periods of probation and suspension are only statutorily set down in legislation dealing with the Defence Force, the Civil, Prison, Police and Fire Services.
Generally private sector employers are free to determine their own probationary terms and suspension provisions.
Where there is a recognized majority union, that union may negotiate these terms for inclusion into the collective agreement.
Whether a contract of employment is for a fixed term or for an indefinite period it may be terminated by either the employer or the worker.
There is no legislation governing termination of contract in general in Trinidad and Tobago, and Common Law applies in the absence of termination provisions in a collective agreement.
There may be termination by performance, by expiry of a fixed term, by agreement of the parties or by breach.
An employer has the right to dismiss an employee for just cause.
The Common Law on summary and constructive dismissal also applies.
Usually in collective agreements and individual contracts a requirement for notice of termination is stipulated.
For monthly paid employees this notice period is usually one month.
The procedure for retrenchment is laid down in the Act, with formal notice in writing required to be given by the employer to the worker, the recognized majority union and the Minister of Labour where five or more workers are to be retrenched.
Provision is made for consultation between the recognized majority union and the employer to avert or lessen the effects of redundancy.
A formula for the payment of severance is contained in the Act, with a stipulation that where more favorable benefits are provided by a collective agreement that applies to the retrenched worker, the collective agreement takes precedence over the Act.
The Retrenchment and Severance Benefits Act is one of a few pieces of legislation that allows the non-unionized individual worker who alleges non-compliance with the Act, to take his or her matter to the Industrial Court.
The worker may take his or her complaint to the Minister of Labour where it is reported as a trade dispute and dealt with as such according to the provisions of the IRA.
The hours of work for State employees is provided for by legislation.
In the private sector hours of work may be settled in a collective agreement.
For employees in general, other than shift workers, the normal hours of work are eight hours a day, usually from 8:00am to 4:00pm, five days a week.
The Minimum Wages Order , Legal Notice No.40 of 1999 attempted to set down hours of work for all workers in Trinidad and Tobago, including State employees.
The Order stipulates that the normal working day shall not exceed eight hours, exclusive of meal and rest breaks, and the normal working week shall not exceed forty hours.
Where workers work only four days in the week the normal work day shall not exceed ten hours.
The Order also provides meal and rest breaks for workers.
However, the Order only applies to workers who receive an hourly rate of $10.50 or less, and so unfortunately many workers are excluded.
Unionized workers may rely on their representative associations or trade unions to negotiate fair hours of work on their behalf.
However, non-unionized workers who earn more than $10.50 an hour in an establishment where no collective agreement exists must fend for themselves.
Leave entitlements for Government daily rated workers are provided for in the Collective Agreement between the Chief Personnel Officer and The National Union of Government and Federated Workers, 1999-2001.
In both the public and private sectors employees are only eligible for paid vacation leave after having twelve months continuous service.
The State also provides for no pay leave to be granted to employees who wish to further their education and leave where the employee holds a post in a trade union.
In the private sector employers and unions may agree on leave entitlements which become part of a registered collective agreement which is binding on both employer and employees.
Where no collective agreement exists paid public holidays, vacation and sick leave are at the discretion of the employer.
Maternity Leave in Trinidad and Tobago is governed by the Maternity Protection Act , No.
4 of 1998 (hereinafter referred to as the MPA) which binds both private employers and the State.
The purpose of the Act is to establish a minimum level of rights and benefits for women workers.
It is a provision of the MPA that it shall not apply where any written law, industrial award or collective agreement prescribes conditions more favorable than those specified in the MPA.
Prior to the MPA only legislation relating to the Civil Service, including the Police, Fire and Prison Services contained provisions on maternity leave.
Since its enactment the MPA takes precedence over those provisions, except where those provisions are more beneficial to the employee than the MPA.
As with the Retrenchment and Severance Benefits Act a non-unionized individual employee who alleges non compliance with the MPA may report her claim to the Minister of Labour where it is deemed to be a trade dispute and dealt with as such under the IRA.
An employee is therefore not denied her right of redress, even though she is not a member of a trade union.
The Occupational Safety and Health Act , assented on 30 January 2004, but still awaiting proclamation, prohibits the employment of young persons on dangerous machines.
The Minimum Wages Order also sets overtime rates.
For the first four hours of overtime the worker shall receive one and one half times the hourly rate.
For the next four hours, two times the hourly rate and thereafter three times the hourly rate.
For time worked on an off day, two times the hourly rate is payable for the first eight hours, and thereafter, three times the hourly rate.
While there are no statutory provisions for worker representation in the enterprise, the industrial relations practice, supported by case law of the Industrial Court, entitles unions to appoint a worker as the union representative for a bargaining unit.
This representative is sometimes referred to as the shop steward.
It is also industrial relations practice that when having discussions with the worker representative on union business the employer must treat him or her not as an employee, but as the representative of the union.
About 22% of the work force is represented by trade unions that have negotiated collective bargaining agreements which set the terms and conditions of their employment.
Trade Unions in Trinidad and Tobago are regulated by the Trade Unions Act, 1932, Chapter 88:02.
Pursuant to this Act trade unions were deemed to be no longer illegal as being in restraint of trade.
Trade unions are required to be registered by the Registrar of trade unions under the Trade Unions Act, and any seven (7) or more members may register a union.
The provisions for registration are set out in the Act and include the following requirements:
that no other trade union carries an identical name or one so nearly resembling that of the union seeking registration to deceive the public;
Any trade union duly registered under the Trade Unions Act may purchase or lease property which would be vested in its trustees.
The Act makes provision for legal action to be taken against any trustee who misuses or misappropriates the union's property.
Any person who is aggrieved by the Registrar's refusal to register a trade union, or by the withdrawal or cancellation of a certificate of registration may appeal the Registrar's decision before the Supreme Court.
The Registrar may not withdraw or cancel a certificate of registration arbitrarily, but only in the circumstances outlined in the Act.
While the Constitution guarantees for every citizen of Trinidad and Tobago the right to join a trade union, the Industrial Relations Act acknowledges a person's right not to be a member of a trade union or other employee organization.
Where a person is a member of a trade union, he or she has a right to take part in the activities of the union and to become an official of that union.
The process of collective bargaining is regulated by Part IV of the Industrial Relations Act (IRA).
The IRA states that the parties to a collective agreement shall be the recognized majority union, and the employer or the successor to either the recognized majority union or the employer.
The purpose of collective bargaining is to establish terms and conditions of employment for a bargaining unit, agreed between the recognized majority union and the employer, into a collective agreement.
Where a recognized majority union and an employer agree to initiate negotiation of a collective agreement they must notify the Minister of Labour.
When parties have settled upon a collective agreement it must be registered by the Industrial Court either through the Minister or by either party to the agreement.
Only upon registration does the collective agreement become binding upon the parties and enforceable by the Industrial Court.
A collective agreement may be made for a period of not less than three (3) years and no more than five (5) years.
The IRA requires that collective agreements contain effective provisions for the settlement of disputes, including differences between the parties arising out of the interpretation, application and violation of collective agreements, with the Industrial Court as the final arbiter.
Collective agreements usually also contain provisions for wages, leave entitlements, severance pay, travelling and other allowances.
Any collective agreement which governs a bargaining unit applies to every worker in that bargaining unit, whether that worker is a member of the recognized majority union or not.
The provisions of a collective agreement become the terms and conditions of employment of each employee's contract whether or not that employee even knows of the existence of the agreement.
Any provision in a collective agreement which limits the application of the IRA or which promotes preferential treatment for members of a particular union is void.
Once a collective agreement has been registered every member of the respective bargaining unit is entitled to be protected by it.
The IRA also provides that where a trade union has attained certification as the recognized majority union the employer must recognize that union and is obliged to meet and treat with that union.
Both parties have a duty to bargain in good faith.
After parties have undergone the disputes procedure set out in their collective agreements, and the dispute remains unresolved, they may report the matter to the Minister of Labour as a trade dispute under the Disputes Procedure set out in Part V of the IRA .
The Disputes Procedure set out in the IRA establishes a system that allows parties to treat with their dispute in a structured framework of conciliation, culminating in arbitration before the Industrial Court, that is if conciliation does not result in resolution.
where there is no recognized majority union, any trade union of which the worker(s) who are parties to the dispute are members in good standing.
An individual worker is incapable of being a party to a trade dispute under the IRA.
Therefore, an individual worker has no locus standi before the Industrial Court, under the IRA.
Initially the legislation was structured so as to encourage and support trade union membership and development.
It is without doubt that it would be in the interest of both employer and union to restrict an individual worker's right to come before the Industrial Court, but it is the duty of the Legislature to safeguard the rights of workers, especially in light of the increase in non-unionized contract employment.
It was with this duty in mind that the Legislature passed the Retrenchment and Severance Benefits Act , No.
32 of 1985 and the Maternity Protection Act , No.
4 of 1998.
Both these Acts give the non-unionized individual worker an avenue by which he or she may bring his or her grievance before the Industrial Court.
Both Acts allow the worker to report his or her grievance to the Minister as a trade dispute to be dealt with according to the provisions of the IRA.
Further, a trade union, other than a recognized majority union may only represent a worker in a rights dispute, that is a dispute emanating out of existing terms and conditions of employment.
Interest disputes, that is, disputes concerning the formulation of terms and conditions of employment may only be handled by a recognized majority union.
The Special Tribunal is established by the Civil Service Act, Chap 23:01 .
The purpose of the Special Tribunal is to hear and determine disputes that arise in the Civil Service, Teaching Service, Prison, Fire and Police Services, the Supplemental Police Service and disputes concerning Central Bank employees.
The composition of the Special Tribunal is provided for in the IRA.
The Special Tribunal consists of the Chairman and two other members of the Essential Services Division.
While the Special Tribunal is not a Division of the Industrial Court it does exercise the powers and functions the Court possesses in respect of the essential services.
The award of the Special Tribunal is final and binding on the parties.
The Industrial Court is divided into two divisions, the General Services Division and the Essential Services Division.
The Essential Services Division exercises jurisdiction over the essential services which are listed in the Second Schedule of the IRA as the Electricity Service, Water and Sewerage Services, External Communications, Fire Service, Health Services, Hospital Services, Sanitation Services, Public School Bus Service and Civil aviation services.
The General Services Division has jurisdiction over all services that are not essential services, meaning that this Division deals with all labour disputes in the private sector.
Industrial action is strictly regulated by the IRA .
Industrial action by way of strike or lockout may only be taken in respect of unresolved interest disputes, and the IRA provides that only a recognized majority union may take strike action.
An employer may not take lockout action against workers who are not represented by a recognized majority union.
Where either the employer or the recognized majority union intends to take such action they must give notice to the other party and to the Minister of Labour.
Strike or lockout action may only be taken in respect of unresolved disputes, which means that the Minister of Labour would have had the opportunity to instigate or encourage conciliation at the Ministry under the disputes procedure in the IRA.
No strike or lockout action may be taken after parties have requested the Minister to refer the dispute to the Industrial Court for determination.
The IRA protects employees by preserving their contracts of employment where strike or lockout action is taken in conformity with the IRA.
Employers are under no obligation to pay striking employees.
Where an employer takes lockout action contrary to the provisions of the IRA he or she is liable to a fine of $20,000 and to pay wages to the worker for the period of the lockout.
Where a union breaches the IRA it is liable to a fine of $10,000 and may have its certificate of recognition cancelled.
An employer has the option of treating the contract of a worker who participates in illegal strike action as terminated.
The worker through his or her union however may apply to the Industrial Court to have the dismissal set aside.
Engineer A provides services regularly through a job shop system.
In this type of arrangement the engineer is listed with a so-called job shop, which is actually a referral service, and which advises the engineer from time to time of opportunities for part-time or temporary employment.
When so referred the engineer is interviewed by the prospective employer/company, which determines if the engineer has the qualifications required for a particular assignment.
If so, the employer/company offers temporary employment at stipulated hourly rates and other working conditions.
Thereafter, the employer/company pays the job shop an agreed-upon rate, which in turn, pays the engineer the rate agreed upon between the engineer and the employer/company.
The job shop takes care of tax deductions, social security deductions, etc.
and receives a fee from the employer/company for overhead and profit.
When the temporary assignment is finished the engineer is usually returned to the job shop list for future assignments as such opportunities arise.
Under this kind of arrangement, Engineer A has agreed to provide services for Company B to analyze a new engineering development and draft a technical manual for use by customers for the new product.
Company B upon hiring Engineer A for the particular assignment has advised Engineer A that it estimates the work will take approximately six months.
After three days on the job with Company B, Engineer A is advised by the job shop that a more lucrative assignment has opened with Company C and that Engineer A appears to be well qualified for the new assignment opportunity.
Engineer A is attracted by the apparently better offer, but before deciding on whether to be interviewed by Company C for the better position inquires if leaving Company B under these circumstances would be ethical.
In Case 69-3, the Board recognized that the use of third party search firms in the recruitment of engineering employees was a proper method of obtaining the names of prospective engineering employees.
There we noted: " .
. .
the basic principle is that there should be an open opportunity for engineers to improve their position through a change in employment, if they so desire... We might react in quite a different fashion if the prospective employer or his agent made personal contact and sought to induce the employee away from his present employment.
Depending upon the facts and circumstances of the personal contact and the type of inducement, this might be considered the use of 'unfair' methods.
" Although Case 69-3 generally dealt with the flip side of the case presently before the Board because it reviewed the conduct of an "engineer-employer" rather than an "engineer-employee," many of the same considerations appear to be applicable.
While an engineer is free to seek and accept employment, the engineer is required to do so in a manner consistent with the Code of Ethics.
NSPE Professional Policy No.
19-E provides only general guidance for the engineer-employee under the facts of this case.
It states: "The National Society of Professional Engineers believes that an individual professional engineer has the right to seek and accept other employment provided the seeking and acceptance of such other employment is consistent with the Code of Ethics as it pertains to relations with clients and employers.
NSPE opposes any agreements between employers which limit the individual engineer's employment opportunities.
Nothing in this policy opposes the use of noncompetitive agreements between partners, shareholders, and/or other persons sharing an ownership interest in an engineering firm.
" Under more traditional methods of employment of engineers, which usually anticipates a continuing, even though indefinite, relationship, either the employer or employee may legally and ethically terminate the employment relationship in the absence of an employment contract for a stipulated period of time.
In that kind of traditional employer-employee relationship it is generally expected that if a professional employee decides to take a different position with another employer the employee will first discuss the reasons for leaving with the employer, which may result in a resolution of the causes of dissatisfaction and retention of the employment.
However, there is no ethical restraint on the engineer leaving the employment for the engineer's own reasons without such discussion or the giving of the reasons, which may range from economic considerations to working conditions or purely personal problems.
Likewise, there is no restraint on the employer terminating the employment for economic or other reasons, subject only to contractual agreements or applicable laws governing employment matters.
In this case the only ethical standard to consider is whether the departure of Engineer A after only three days of employment would breach the ethical obligation to be a "faithful agent" as stipulated in Section II.4.
of the Code.
That reference has long been in the Code of Ethics as a philosophical statement of what should be a professional employer-employee or professional client relationship, and we continue to endorse its general purpose and objective for that purpose.
At the same time, we must recognize that such a sound philosophical sentiment cannot override the right of every engineer to change employment for reasons the engineer deems sound and sufficient.In this case a departure after only three days of employment is a "hard case," but we cannot lay down any hard and fast rules for a time interval to govern when an engineer is justified in making a change for what the engineer considers to be a better position or better opportunity for advancement.
It is recognized that under these circumstances Company B has been harmed to some extent by now having to locate and hire another qualified engineer for the assignment, but that harm cannot outweigh the right of the engineer to exercise personal judgment in determining a course of action best suited to the engineer's personal concerns.As indicated above, the "faithful agent" concept is a sound philosophy which should govern professional employment relationships to the extent possible, to be construed, however, under the peculiar facts of each case.
In its best practical sense, to be a "faithful agent" means to devote oneself to the best interest of the employer or client while serving in a professional capacity for that employer or client, but it cannot and does not amount to a master-servant relationship which binds an individual to a particular employment when that individual determines that "the grass is greener" in another place.
Additional Views: We concur with the conclusion in this case and note that the opinion reflected a unanimous vote of the Board.
It is further noteworthy that of the two normal choices available to the Board, (i.e., ethical or unethical), the Board opted to find that the conduct of Engineer A " .
. .
would not be unethical .
. .
" On the surface, this may appear as a play on words.
In fact, however, this wording was one important element to approval by the supporters of this additional view.
The discussion in this case clearly alludes to the Board's difficulty in balancing the implications of conflict in interpreting the expectations of behavior of the employed professional engineer as a " .
. .
faithful agent(s) or trustee(s)" in Section II.4.
versus the implicit right of every engineer to change employment for reasons he (the engineer) deems sound and sufficient as interpreted from PP 19-E. The "... not...unethical..." conclusion was a conscious effort by the Board to reduce the harshness of its decision and clearly illustrates that had the facts in the case been different in areas of employment conditions and employer expectations, the conclusion may well have differed in either direction.
For instance, the Board, in arriving at its conclusion, felt that had the facts in this case reflected a more conscious effort toward professionalism on the part of Engineer A in providing Company B with reasonable notice of intent to terminate employment and/or an offer to assist in finding a replacement for this "particular assignment," our conclusion would have been demonstrated more positively in a finding that Engineer A was ethical.
Conversely, the heavier reliance by the Board on PP 19-E should not be construed as diminishing the responsibility of the professional engineer employee to fairly consider his employer's situation as it results from abrupt employment termination, regardless of the third party relationship as evidenced in this case by the job shop.
We also consider it important that Engineer A sought guidance in his actions before termination with Company B and acceptance of employment with Company C, providing the theoretical opportunity to sever employment under more professional and, therefore, ethical conditions.

Unions on the Madrid Metro have forced a pay cut and other concessions on workers who have been involved in militant strike action against plans to cut salaries by five percent.
The agreement has been packaged up to give the Metro management everything it demanded and more.
Metro will save 2 million euros by imposing a one percent pay cut backdated to June and 6 million euros in other staff costs including overtime, special payments, travel expenses and vocational training.
Night transport will also be restructured.
Further negotiations will take place to seek “other alternative formulas” allowing “the best application or distribution of the reduction” of wages.
From all accounts there was uproar at the meetings.
Workers complained that the strike committee had previously promised them that last year’s collective agreement would not be touched.
There would be no wage cuts or disciplining of workers, officials had assured them.
According to El Pais one worker described how the committee had come to earlier meetings “like Che Guevara telling us that there was nothing to negotiate.”
The World Socialist Web Site warned when Metro workers first took strike action at the end of June that the bureaucracy’s demagogy was “purely for show, while the media, government and trade unions increase pressure on the Metro workers before a vote on indefinite strike action takes place at the next mass meeting on Monday, July 5.”
It is clear from the attacks on the Madrid Metro workers that new rank-and-file organisations are needed through which to conduct the class struggle.
The unions are not workers’ organizations, subject to the democratic control of their members, but represent an arm of management.
Jobs, wages, pensions and other hard-won working conditions can be defended only on the basis of an independent political struggle of the entire working class based on a socialist programme.

2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Portugal
Freedom of association is guaranteed in the Constitution and the 2009 Labour Code.
There are no predetermined and precise criteria to evaluate the representativity of unions, but it is considered that only unions having a seat in the Permanent Commission for Social Partnership are representative.
These unions are also referred to by name in law, which serves as an impediment to new trade unions.
Although the right to collective bargaining is secured, bargaining in the public service is defined as "appraisal and discussion".
Negotiations do not result in legally binding collective agreements, and can only concern pay and pay-related issues.
Furthermore, where a situation is considered to be sufficiently grave, the government has the power to issue a ministerial order to bring a wide range of activities into temporary, obligatory public service, including pharmaceutical production and banking.
Although not specifically regulated in law, political strikes are also prohibited.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Anti-union climate: According to the trade union confederation UGT-P, labour and management relations at the company level are tainted by severe pressure on workers not to join a union, considerable interference in trade union activities, and fierce opposition to external trade union representatives.
Atypical employment is hampering organising: Portugal, together with Spain and Poland, has the highest levels of precarious employment in the EU, especially among young workers.
Trade unions see this as one of the reasons why organising and union activities are becoming increasingly difficult.
The results of widespread efforts to moderate or reduce medical care costs were particularly apparent in the Minneapolis--St. Paul, MN, area, where 6,000 registered nurses struck 15 hospitals for 5 weeks to enforce their demands for increased job security in the face of a continuing decline in hospital utilization.
Reportedly, only about 30 percent of the nurses were working full time prior to the work stoppage, the largest recorded strike by nurses in the Nation's history.
One provision of the new contract protects nurses' jobs by providing that cuts in work time be distributed among all nurses in a department on a seniority basis before any jobs can be eliminated.
This will be accomplished by reducing biweekly work hours to 32 for the least senior nurse in a department, then applying the same reduction to other nurses in seniority order.
In another move to increase job security, nurses will be permitted to use $250 of the existing $500 a year tuition reimbursement fund for retraining offered by a variety of institutions.
The remaining money will be available only for training offered by the previously specified types of institutions.
2010 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Sweden
Both public and private sector workers enjoy freedom of association, collective bargaining and the right to strike, and the law allows unions to conduct their activities without interference.
However, a number of recent government regulations have had a negative effect on trade union rights.
In 2003 a law was passed that interfered with existing branch-level collective agreements covering early retirement schemes, and prohibited any such agreements in the future.
In 2007, following the judgement on the Laval case, new provisions were introduced that restricted the right of unions to take collective action and to bargain collectively to defend the rights of foreign workers posted in the country.
Furthermore, when implementing the EU Services Directive in 2009, the government abandoned a provision that required foreign companies in Sweden to have a legal representative in the country to whom the trade unions could deliver their requests for collective bargaining.
Trade union rights in practice and violations in 2009
Settlement of industrial disputes: Industrial disputes are normally settled through negotiations between the parties concerned at the local or national level.
The Labour Court, which includes representatives proposed by the social partners, deals with legal disputes on the interpretation of existing collective agreements where negotiations fail, as well as cases involving allegations of anti-union discrimination.
In cases of conflicts of interest (for instance in the event of collective bargaining or strike action in support of a new collective agreement), a public National Mediation Office is available to assist the parties if they so wish.
Not all farm workers have their own plot of land in a nearby Communal Land or resettlement area, but those who do spread their own and their families' energy between the two homes for both security and investment reasons.
Although the lifestyle on the home farm is seen to be healthier than that on the farm compound, working on commercial farms is familiar - many workers grew up on one - and the monthly wages are attractive.
As well, farm workers can often get agricultural inputs like fertilizer and seeds - and at a better price - for their own farm, which will help to supplement both their meagre diet and their meagre wages.
A home independent from the commercial farm is also invaluable in case a worker leaves his job.
For a farm worker's life, from the conditions of the compound to the possibility of credit and overtime pay, depends heavily on the attitude of the commercial farm operator.
As farm workers put it, their lives depend almost solely on "the laws of the white man/owner.
" Indeed, Zimbabwe's two million farm workers and their families are so dependent on farm owners that they become virtually invisible in most of the country's policy and academic discussions on democracy and development.
Rural Zimbabwe is usually seen as comprising two dichotomous worlds - that of the approximately 4,000 commercial farmers (who still are disproportionately white) and that of peasant farmers of the Communal Lands and resettlement areas.
Farm workers are rarely mentioned in discussions of this "dual economy.
" This way of understanding is especially evident when it comes to "the Land Question" - the dominant forum for discussing democracy and development in rural Zimbabwe.
In 1979, on the eve of Independence, the transitional government scrapped the Masters and Servants Act, the piece of legislation that since 1899 governed labour relations on commercial farms according to the patronizing assumption that the white farm owner knows what is best for the workers.
Under that Act there was no minimum wage.
Rather, wages were significantly lower than in other industries on the pretext that the farmer also provided rations and housing to the workers.
Disciplinary proceedings against workers were permitted for an incredibly wide range of actions, including insulting the farmer's wife or children and refusing to obey a master's command.
Nor was it uncommon for farmers to take the law in their own hands and mete out physical punishment against their workers.
With Independence, the Zanu (PF) government brought agricultural workers to the same level as other formal employees and effectively challenged the wide-ranging authority the farmer had over workers.
Agricultural workers gained the right to organized, which led to the recognition of the General Agricultural and Plantation Workers Union of Zimbabwe (GAPWUZ) as the sole union for farm workers.
Zanu (PF) established party cells on most farms which helped set up workers committees for workers to pass on grievances to management.
Minimum wage legislation for the industry led to remuneration being paid entirely in money (in addition to housing), with wage levels initially set by governmental officials but now negotiated annually by a National Employment Council comprised equally of officials from GAPWUZ and the Agricultural Labour Bureau (ALB), the employers organization.
Furthermore, citizenship rights were granted to long-term residents of Zimbabwe born or patrileneally descended from outside the country.
With the establishment of formal labour relations machinery, minimum wages and the legal possibility of getting land and voting rights, formal rights for farm workers have improved tremendously since 1980.
However, many farm workers today disagree with any sentiment of continual progress.
They acknowledge that for the first time they enjoy rights and attribute this advance to Mugabe.
But, they ruefully note, since the mid-1980s, there has been a reversal of the gains made at Independence.
This change is reflected, in recent times, in the forms of worker representation.
Most worker committees are seen as ineffective, more a conduit for owners to convey concerns to workers rather than an effective forum for workers to raise issues.
The under-staffed GAPWUZ is seen as too distant from daily concerns such as overtime pay, the use of dangerous chemicals without protection, and violence from foremen and managers, while being completely out-of-touch with farm workers' living conditions.
At best, workers see GAPWUZ as only helpful in the final stages of being dismissed.
If a permanent worker is fired without proper leave-pay, GAPWUZ is effective in getting these benefits to him (most commercial farmers refuse to hire women workers as permanent workers and, consequently, women as contract workers are denied the same rights and are largely ignored by GAPWUZ and workers committees).
Once employee's TIME IN & OUT timing captured by any type of machine then it has to be linked to a Time Attendance Software to generate the useful attendance reports.
Those calculated attendance details needs to be linked to payroll software for the employee salary calculation.
In addition to that there is a need to maintain employee leaves like annual leave, medical leave, unpaid leave, etc…
Information from fingerprint time recorder can be transferred to the Time Attendance Software which will calculate the useful information like Lateness, Overtime, allowances, etc...
A good time attendance software should have the option for different shift patterns, Supports unlimited rotation duty roster, Auto-shift feature (System auto-assign working hours group based on IN time), Flexible working hours feature, Scheduling working hour's group feature (No fixed working pattern)
Companies are paying daily allowances like shift allowance, meal allowance, transport allowance to the employees based on some conditions.
For an example a company may like to pay $5 for night shift workers or a company may like to pay $2 who is working more than 5 hours of overtime.
So the time attendance software should have all the above features.
The employee may be paid by hourly rate / daily rate/ monthly fixed basis.
Other than the employee basic salary, the employee's overtime, daily allowances needs to be linked from the time attendance software.
The employee may have some additions or deductions in every month salary like advance payment, medical claim, special allowance, etc… And the employee unpaid leave, lateness & early leaving needs to be deducted from his salary.
And payroll software must have useful reports like, Monthly Salary Summary Report, Overtime Payment Report, Taxation Report, Yearly Summary Report, and Monthly Reconciliation Report.
Leave Module built-in with payroll system: The HR Executive needs to update the employees Annual Leave, Medical Leave, Unpaid Leave, Maternity Leave, etc in to the system manually.
The duration of the working day shall be agreed through collective negotiations or within the contract itself.
In any case, the maximum ordinary working day is 40 hours per week on average throughout the year.
In principle this ordinary working day must be distributed in as even and regular a way possible throughout the day.
However, collective agreements or individual agreements between the company and workers’ representatives may establish an irregular distribution of working hours throughout the year, as long as legal daily and weekly rest periods are respected.
Workers are entitled to a reduction of their working time, with a proportional reduction in wages, if they are directly responsible for a child under six years of age, people with disabilities or family members in certain specific circumstances.
This means hours of work performed over and above the maximum number of normal working hours.
Overtime is voluntary, unless agreed in a collective agreement or working contract, or when required to prevent or repair extraordinary or urgent damage.
Overtime at night is prohibited, except in duly specified and expressly authorised special activities.
It is also prohibited for people under 18 years of age.
collective agreement - this is a negotiation between your employer and a trade union or staff association
If a collective agreement makes a change to employment contracts, the change will still apply to you even if you are not a member of the trade union or staff association.
In some circumstances, action like a demotion or a pay cut might be authorised as a disciplinary measure.
Check the disciplinary procedure to be sure.
Changes can be agreed directly between you and your employer, or through a 'collective agreement' between your employer and a trade union.
This might be allowed by your contract even if you're not a union member.
In California, the general overtime provisions are that a nonexempt employee 18 years of age or older, or any minor employee 16 or 17 years of age who is not required by law to attend school and is not otherwise prohibited by law from engaging in the subject work, shall not be employed more than eight hours in any workday or more than 40 hours in any workweek unless he or she receives one and one-half times his or her regular rate of pay for all hours worked over eight hours in any workday and over 40 hours in the workweek.
Eight hours of labor constitutes a day's work, and employment beyond eight hours in any workday or more than six days in any workweek is permissible provided the employee is compensated for the overtime at not less than:
There are, however, a number of exemptions from the overtime law.
An "exemption" means that the overtime law does not apply to a particular classification of employees.
There are also a number of exceptions to the general overtime law stated above.
An "exception" means that overtime is paid to a certain classification of employees on a basis that differs from that stated above.
Overtime is based on the regular rate of pay, which is the compensation you normally earn for the work you perform.
The regular rate of pay includes a number of different kinds of remuneration, such as hourly earnings, salary, piecework earnings, and commissions.
In no case may the regular rate of pay be less than the applicable minimum wage .
Ordinarily, the hours to be used in computing the regular rate of pay may not exceed the legal maximum regular hours which, in most cases, is 8 hours per workday , 40 hours per workweek .
This maximum may also be affected by the number of days one works in a workweek.
It is important to determine what maximum is legal in each case.
The alternate method of scheduling and computing overtime under most Industrial Welfare Commission Wage Orders , based on an alternative workweek schedule of four 10-hour days or three 12-hour days does not affect the regular rate of pay, which in this case also would be computed on the basis of 40 hours per workweek.
The agreed upon regular hours must be used if they are less than the legal maximum regular hours.
For example, if you work 32 to 38 hours each week, there is an agreed workweek of 35 hours, and thirty-five hours is the figure used to determine the regular rate of pay.
However, in circumstances where the workweek is less than 40 hours, the law does not require payment of the overtime premium unless the employee works more than eight hours in a workday or more than 40 hours in a workweek.
In other words, assuming you are employed under a policy that provides for a 35-hour workweek, the law does not require the employer to pay the overtime premium until after 40 hours in a workweek.
If you work more than 35 but fewer than 40 hours in a workweek, you will be entitled to be paid for the extra hours at your regular rate of pay, as overtime premium pay is only required after 40 hours in a workweek.
If you are paid by the piece or commission, either of the following methods may be used to determine the regular rate of pay for purposes of computing overtime:
The piece or commission rate is used as the regular rate and you are paid one and one-half this rate for production during the first four overtime hours in a workday, and double time for all hours worked beyond 12 in a workday; or
Divide your total earnings for the workweek, including earnings during overtime hours, by the total hours worked during the workweek, including the overtime hours.
For each overtime hour worked you are entitled to an additional one-half the regular rate for hours requiring time and one-half, and to the full rate for hours requiring double time.
If you are paid two or more rates by the same employer during the workweek, the regular rate is the "weighted average" which is determined by dividing your total earnings for the workweek, including earnings during overtime hours, by the total hours worked during the workweek, including the overtime hours.
For example, if you work 32 hours at $9.00 an hour and 10 hours during the same workweek at $7.00 an hour, your weighted average (and thus the regular rate for that workweek) is $8.52.
This is calculated by adding your $358 straight time pay for the workweek ((32hours x $9.00/hour) + (10 hours x $7.00/hour) = $358) and dividing it by the 42 hours you worked.
Yes, California law requires that employers pay overtime, whether authorized or not, at the rate of one and one-half times the employee's regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of eight up to an including 12 hours in any workday, and for the first eight hours of work on the seventh consecutive day of work in a workweek, and double the employee's regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of 12 in any workday and for all hours worked in excess of eight on the seventh consecutive day of work in a workweek.
An employer can discipline an employee if he or she violates the employer's policy of working overtime without the required authorization.
However, California's wage and hour laws require that the employee be compensated for any hours he or she is "suffered or permitted to work, whether or not required to do so.
" California case law holds that "suffer or permit" means work the employer knew or should have known about.
Thus, an employee cannot deliberately prevent the employer from obtaining knowledge of the unauthorized overtime worked, and come back later to claim recovery.
The employer must have the opportunity to obey the law.
Yes, if it is a nondiscretionary bonus.
A nondiscretionary bonus is included in determining the regular rate of pay for computing overtime when it is based upon hours worked, production or proficiency.
Discretionary bonuses or sums paid as gifts at a holiday or other special occasions, such as a reward for good service, which are not measured by or dependent upon hours worked, production or efficiency, are not included for purposes of determining the regular rate of pay.
It depends.
A salaried employee must be paid overtime unless they meet the test for exempt status as defined by federal and state laws, or unless they are specifically exempted from overtime by the provisions of one of the Industrial Welfare Commission Wage Orders regulating wages, hours and working conditions.
If you are paid two or more rates by the same employer during the workweek, the regular rate is the "weighted average" which is determined by dividing your total earnings for the workweek, including earnings during overtime hours, by the total hours worked during the workweek, including the overtime hours.
For example, if you work 32 hours at $9.00 an hour and 10 hours during the same workweek at $7.00 an hour, the weighted average (and thus the regular rate for that workweek) is $8.52.
This is calculated by adding your $358 straight time pay for the workweek ((32hours x $9.00/hour) + (10 hours x $7.00/hour) = $358) and dividing it by the 42 hours you worked.
Yes, an employer may dictate the employee's work schedule and hours.
Additionally, under most circumstances the employer may discipline an employee, up to and including termination, if the employee refuses to work scheduled overtime.
Last week I worked Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday, eight hours each day.
I was out ill all day Friday.
For the workweek I was paid 48 hours at my regular hourly rate.
Am I entitled to eight hours of overtime pay?
No, you are not entitled to any overtime pay.
Overtime is calculated based on hours actually worked, and you worked only 40 hours during the workweek .
Another example of where you get paid your regular wages but the time is not counted towards overtime is if you get paid for a holiday but do not work that day.
In such a case, the time upon which the holiday pay is based does not count as hours worked for purposes of determining overtime because no work was performed.
Overtime wages must be paid no later than the payday for the next regular payroll period after which the overtime wages were earned.
Labor Code Section 204 Only the payment of overtime wages may be delayed to the payday of the next following payroll period as the straight time wages must still be paid within the time set forth in the applicable Labor Code section in the pay period in which they were earned; or, in the case of employees who are paid on a weekly, biweekly, or semimonthly basis, not more than seven calendar days following the close of the payroll period.
No, California law requires that an employee be paid all overtime compensation notwithstanding any agreement to work for a lesser wage.
Consequently, such an agreement or "waiver" will not prevent an employee from recovering the difference between the wages paid the employee and the overtime compensation he or she is entitled to receive.
Labor Code Section 1194
Overtime generally means any work over the basic working hours included in your contract.
Regulations say that most workers can't be made to work more than an average of 48 hours a week, but they can agree to work longer.
This agreement must be in writing and signed by you.
There's no legal right to pay for working extra hours, and there are no minimum statutory levels of overtime pay, although your average pay rate must not fall below the National Minimum Wage.
Your contract of employment should include details of overtime pay rates and how they are worked out.
Instead of paying for overtime, some employers offer 'time off in lieu' (TOIL).
This is agreed between you and your employer, and any time you take off will normally be at a time that suits the employer.
Some companies have rules on when time off can be taken, but others arrange time off on a case by case basis.
Overtime isn't usually taken into account when working out holiday pay or paid maternity, paternity or adoption leave.
However, it is taken into account when the overtime is guaranteed and you have to work the overtime as part of your contract of employment.
Your contract of employment should include the conditions for working overtime.
You only have to work overtime if your contract says so.
Even if it does you can't usually be forced to work more than an average of 48 hours per week.
If you are told to work more than this and you don't want to, you should take it up with your employer.
Your contract of employment should say what your normal working hours and days are, and this may include or exclude working on Sundays.
Whether this counts as overtime working depends on your contract of employment.
Workers in betting premises and in retail shops can choose to opt out of working on a Sunday.
Unless it says differently in their contract of employment, employers will usually only pay overtime to part-time workers when they work:
Your employer may need to change your conditions or patterns of work because of business or economic factors.
However, your contract of employment can only be changed if both you and your employer agree to this.
It's a breach of contract to change your working conditions without your agreement.
Firstly, check your contract of employment for details of how overtime is worked out and what the rates of pay should be.
If you don't have a written contract, you may find the article on contracts of employment helpful.
Remember that your employer must by law give you written terms and conditions within two months of starting work.
If anything isn't clear, you should take up the problem with your employer.
You might find it helpful to ask an employee representative, such as a trade union official, to help you.
You should also look at the papers you were given when you started work, such as the written statement of terms, and an employee's handbook if one was provided.
The main source of the labour legislation in Bulgaria is the Labour Code, which was most recently amended in 2005 (“LC”).
Termination of employment provisions are also dealt with in collective agreements and individual labour contracts.
The LC regulates labour relationships between the employee and the employer, as well as other relationships immediately related to them.
It also aims to ensure the freedom and protection of labour, good working conditions, as well as the conducting of social dialogue between the State, employees, employers and their organizations, to settle labour issues.
Unpaid leave: All employees are entitled to unpaid leave unrelated to their paid leave or length of service entitlements.
Under the Bulgarian Labour Code, the minimum age for employment is 16.
Employees younger than 18-years old can be hired subject to a permit from the Labour Inspectorate.
Employment can be permanent or of limited duration and on a full- or part-time basis.
Nationals of certain countries can visit Bulgaria for up to three months without a visa, but will need to be granted a work permit or visa to take up employment.
Citizens of the following countries, with valid regular passports, have the right to stay in Bulgaria up to 90 days without a visa:
Foreigners with a permanent resident's permit and refugees who receive sanctuary in Bulgaria are entitled, like other Bulgarian citizens, to work in Bulgaria.
Temporary work permits are issued to foreigners and bear the name of the foreign worker, the name of the employee and the period for which the permit is valid.
A work permit is not granted if the work can be undertaken by a Bulgarian citizen.
An employer cannot hire foreign workers in excess of 10% of his total work force.
Foreigners who work in Bulgaria as self employed individuals or as partners in a business, must take out the relevant insurance cover.
The insurance premium is between 29% - 32% of income.
Prospective employers should apply for work permits for new employees at the local Labour Office.
Foreigners with an employment contract and a work permit can apply for residence for the duration of the contract.
Everyone employed for more than five working days or 40 hours per calendar month must be covered for all social security risks.
The contributions to social security required from employees are made by the employer from the employee’s monthly wages.
Self-employed persons are also self-insured for social security purposes.
Social security contributions are assessed as a percentage of all earned income, whether paid or accrued.
Contribution rates and the proportions to be made by the insurer and by the beneficiary are set by the Social Security Code.
Contributions to the Occupational Accident and Disease Fund are made entirely by the insurers.
Overtime is an employment standard that sets the threshold for hours of work after which most employees receive overtime pay.
For most employees covered by the overtime provisions of the ESA , there is an overtime threshold set at 44 hours in a work week.
After 44 hours in a work week, any time worked by the employee must be compensated at the overtime rate.
For most employees, overtime rates apply after they have worked 44 hours in a work week.
Whether or not an employee is permitted under the Act to work excess weekly hours, the employer must still pay overtime pay for any hours worked in excess of 44 per week.
An employee and an employer can agree in writing that the employee will receive paid time off work instead of overtime pay.
This is sometimes called "banked" time or "time off in lieu".
The employee must receive 1½ hours of paid time off work for each hour of overtime worked and the time off must be taken within three months of the week when the overtime was earned or, if the employee agrees in writing, within 12 months after the week when the overtime was worked.
Can I agree to give up my right to overtime pay?
No.
An employee cannot agree to give up his or her right to receive overtime pay under the ESA.
Any such agreement is not allowed and the employee is still entitled to overtime pay.
However, an employee may agree in writing to average hours of work over periods of two weeks or more for the purposes of determining his or her overtime entitlements.
Under such agreements, an employee would only qualify for overtime pay if the average hours worked per week during the averaging period exceed 44 hours.
In addition to having agreements in writing, the employer must also obtain an approval to average hours for overtime purposes from the Director of Employment Standards.
For further information see Your Guide to the Employment Standards Act: Overtime .
The territory of the Maltese Islands is now divided into 67 different localities (53 in Malta; 14 in Gozo & Comino) each with its own democratically elected local council.
By means of a gradual process of devolution, local councils are now responsible for the upkeep of public spaces and gardens, fixing and maintenance of road signs and markings; communication services.
They will in future be also responsible for tourist and transport services; and the setting up and running of nurseries, child care facilities, kindergartens, state schools, health centres, state pharmacies and senior citizen homes.
The Stevedores and Port Workers Ordinance of 1939 and the Factories Ordinance of 1940 were the first attempts at establishing the wages and working hours applicable to specific industrial activity in Malta.
But it was the dramatic setting up of the General Workers’ Union in 1943, which spearheaded a spate of overdue labour legislation.
The GWU, set up during wartime on 5th October 1943, already commanded some 22,000 members in 1944 when the national labour force was around 80,000.
In this way, trade unions in Malta, which had been registered officially since 1919, were only provided a legal code of operation for the first time with the Trade Unions and Trade Disputes Ordinance of 1945.
In particular, trade unions and their members were provided with immunity from actions of tort in respect of any offence committed in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute.
In the meantime, the then Director of Labour & Social Services took on the duties of Registrar of Trade Unions.
Health, Safety & General Welfare Regulations to complement the Factories Ordinance were promulgated in 1945.
These were eventually followed by other regulations, including those relating to building and steam boiler safety and to night work for women, in 1951.
Following the election of Malta’s first-ever Labour Government in 1947, a Conciliation & Arbitration Act was promulgated in 1948.
This laid down the machinery to be used for the settlement of trade disputes, including a Court of Inquiry and an Arbitration Tribunal; but it excluded all military and civil service personnel from its remit.
This statutory exclusion of public officers from the scope of specific labour law is still maintained.
The Essential Supplies and Services (Settlement of Disputes) Regulations of 1952 were intended to protect citizens from any attempt by trade unions to hamper the provision of essential supplies or services.
An Employment Service Act in 1955 gave birth to a National Employment Board which stipulated the conditions for the registration of the unemployed.
The key piece of legislation on individual labour relations, replacing the already outdated Trade Unions and Trade Disputes Ordinance, has been the Conditions of Employment (Regulation) Act of 1952.
Known as CERA, This fundamental piece of legislation survived half a century laying down a broad range of policies concerning the regulation of the relationship between employers and employees, now considered as a contract of service.
It protected employment with rules for payment of wages, overtime, sick leave and vacation leave; as well as from its abusive termination.
Wages were considered as privileged debts.
The Department of Labour was boosted with the additional duties of inspection and enforcement.
Under CERA, a whole range of wages council orders, set up by specifically constituted Wages Councils, started fixing specific conditions of employment as were deemed applicable in specific sectors.
Amongst the first, one finds those governing Cinemas & Theatres as well as Public Transport.
Another novelty was the Labour Board, a national advisory body intended to submit recommendations for statutory provisions to the Minister, including advice on the number and constitution of Wages Councils.
Thus, the Wages Councils and the Labour Board were pioneers in the operation of legally-backed tripartism and social dialogue in Malta.
Interestingly, the first official international involvement by Malta in labour relations took place with the formal participation of Government, employer and trade union representatives at annual Geneva Conference of the International Labour Organisation in 1955.
The key piece of legislation on collective labour relations has been the Industrial Relations Act of 1976, known as IRA.
This Act consolidated the Trade Unions and Trade Disputes Ordinance of 1945 and the Conciliation & Arbitration Act of 1948, while introducing new features which reflected developments in national collective labour relations: these included the issue of union recognition; the possibility of ordering reinstatements in cases of unjustified dismissals; the separate registration of trade unions and employer associations; and the setting up of an Industrial Tribunal.
A schedule of medical personnel expected to provide service at all times was included with the Act.
A section setting up a Joint Negotiating Council for the regulation of disputes in the public sector was included in the Act – but was never brought into force.
Since 1990, a new set of labour legislation has been promulgated.
This has had the effect of adjourning the legislative machinery to current challenges – such as the flexibilisation of employment patterns, including a-typical work; the key role of training in facilitating return to employment; a concern with occupational health and safety; and the full details of the social policy regime of the European Union’s acquis communautaire.
With Act 35 of 1990, an Employment & Training Corporation took over the Database (Work Book), Training & Inspectorate Functions of the former Labour Department; and a National Employment Authority replaced the former National Employment Board.
With Act 7 of 1994, a Commission for Occupational Health and Safety was set up, and then replaced by an Occupational Safety & Health Authority by means of Act 28 of 2000.
A Protection of Persons with Disability Act (2000) and a Gender Equality Act (2002) ensure special mechanisms for the elimination of discrimination.
As far as national structures for social dialogue are concerned, a Malta Council for Economic and Social Development Act was promulgated by means of Act 15 of 2001, setting up the MCESD on a legal footing for the first time.
The MCESD had been operating as a national vehicle for social dialogue and consultation amongst Government, employers and trade unions for a number of years, with the first formal attempt during an incomes policy accord over the period 1990-1993.
Sub-Part 1 Status, registration and conduct of trade unions and employer’s associations
Some 230 collective agreements regulate the conditions of employment of around 25,000 employees in the Maltese private sector- around a third of the total gainful employment in this sector.
Most of these agreements are enterprise specific.
The awards of the Industrial Tribunal serve as a benchmark to future awards, especially in the clear absence of any provision prescribed at law.
For example, ever since 1977, specific occupational groups within enterprises have been able to negotiate their own specific collective agreements, following a ruling of the Industrial Tribunal.
A number of landmark judicial decisions also regulate the practice of labour regulation.
The latest such ruling was by the Court of Appeal in May 2001, overturning a decision of the Inferior Courts and confirming that industrial action taken by a trade union at Malta Freeport in January 1998 against measures announced in the Government’s Budget was legitimate; however, the blockade of the Malta Freeport was abusive and illegal as this did not constitute peaceful picketing.
The probationary period base line is six months throughout, but extended to one year for salaried positions of responsibility.
During probation the employment may be terminated at will by either party without assigning any reason, provided that a week’s notice of the termination of employment is given to the other party in the case of an employee who has been in the employment of the same employer continuously for more than one month.
that the employee at the time of the dismissal was a member of a trade union, or is seeking office as, or acting or has acted in the capacity of an employees’ representative; or
A contract of employment for an indefinite time may be terminated, by giving notice, by the employee without assigning any reason and by the employer, only on grounds of redundancy: However, notice of termination of employment may not be given during maternity leave or during the period of incapacity for work or during such other period as the Minister may prescribe.
There is no statutory provision for severance payments at law.
However, it is common practice for trade unions or individual employers to negotiate or offer severance payments in specific cases, especially in matters of collective redundancy.
Such measures may also be enshrined within extant collective agreements.
According with the law an employer can terminate the employment of an employee when the employee reaches retirement age as defined in the Social Security Act.
The law defines unfair dismissal in the following terms:
(a) the termination by the employer in respect of that worker of a contract of employment for an indefinite time (other than probationary employment as defined in this Act) being a termination which is not made solely on the grounds of redundancy or for a good and sufficient cause in accordance with the relevant provisions of this Act or any regulations prescribed hereunder; or
(b) which is made in contravention of the provisions of article 64(4) (refers to acts done by a person in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute and in pursuance of a directive issued by a trade union); or
The Industrial Tribunal now enjoys exclusive jurisdiction to consider and decide all cases of alleged unfair dismissals, including those of employees under a fixed-term contract of employment.
In cases where the Industrial Tribunal finds in favour of the dismissed employee it may order reinstatement when it considers that it would be practicable and in accordance with equity, for the complainant to be reinstated or re-engaged by the employer.
In other cases the Tribunal will order compensation only.
Typically it will not order reinstatement when the employee occupied a position of special trust nor in cases where the employee has not made a specific request for reinstatement.
In such cases the Tribunal will order adequate compensation only.
To this end the law prescribes that in determining the amount of compensation, the Tribunal is to take into consideration the real damages and losses incurred by the worker who was unjustly dismissed, as well as other circumstances, including the worker’s age and skills as may affect the employment potential of the said worker.
Legal Working Time.
Usual working time.
Overtime and Overtime Rates: The Constitution of Malta (Article 13[2]) lays down that all workers shall have, and indeed may not renounce to, one day of rest per week as well as paid leave; the same article also states that national legislation shall stipulate the maximum statutory number of normal working hours.
While the provision to do so does exist at law, no nationally defined ‘working week’ across the board exists.
Specific working time patterns and arrangements, as well as payment terms, are negotiated and included in a variety of collective agreements.
Overtime rates are typically calculated at ‘one and a half’ times the normal hourly rates on weekdays (150%) and at twice the normal hourly rate on Sundays and public holidays (200%).
According to a 2001 survey by the European Foundation for Living & Working Conditions, the average length of the working week in Malta is 40.4 hours.
The ratification of the ‘48 Hour’ Directive (93/104/EC) will oblige employers to refrain from engaging employees on overtime against their will, where and if they exceed a 48 hour week.
So far, employees have not been able to refuse overtime requests from employers.
By means of Legal Notice 92 of 2000 which came into force on January 1st 2001 and which replaces Legal Notice 184 of 1996, Malta has implemented the provisions of Council Directive 92/85, which establishes measures intended to improve the health and safety of working women who are pregnant, have just delivered a baby or are breastfeeding.
It protects such workers from dismissal resulting from their condition; and obliges a minimization of exposure to risks through the adjustment of working conditions or through the temporary transfer to another activity.
If any of these two measures is not possible or feasible, then special paid leave must be made available.
A non-exhaustive list of physical, chemical and biological agents, processes and working conditions to which such women workers must not be exposed or must not be allowed to perform is provided.
Night work is also not allowed during pregnancy and up to 13 weeks following childbirth.
With the coming into force of the new Act, the natural or adoptive working parent of a child will become entitled to three months of parental leave without pay, as long as the child is not older than 8 years of age.
Since April 1996, one year of unpaid parental leave has been allowed to public officers.
An additional three years of unpaid parental leave was also made available to public officers as a career break.
Since December 1999, public officers could also benefit from special unpaid leave of one year in order to foster a child.
Public officers have their sick leave and sick leave benefit entitlements regulated by the Estacode (Chapter 5.3.2.6).
The sick leave entitlement of other workers in the para-statal and private sectors is regulated by the provisions of the respective collective agreements.
Otherwise, sick leave is determined on the basis of the wage regulation orders specific to particular employment sectors.
Educational leave, leave for trade union purposes or because of the holding of public office
Malta has not ratified ILO Convention No.
140 (Paid Educational Leave).
However, provisions in most collective agreements at enterprise level allow designated trade union officials in such enterprises to participate on full pay in educational activities organised by their trade union during their working time.
The Public Service regularly grants time off for educational purposes to designated officers; and in most cases encourages educational pursuits by rewarding the successful completion of certain recognised courses with financial rewards (such as allowances).
Schooling is compulsory in Malta until the completion of one’s sixteenth year; although around 800 young persons at any time obtain permission from the Education Division to forego schooling and seek employment due to particular family reasons.
A certain amount of informal child labour is tolerated in small family businesses, especially in the summer months.
By means of Legal Notice 91 of 2000 which came into force on January 1st 2002, Malta has ratified the provisions of Council Directive 94/33/EC regarding the safety and health of young workers up to the age of 18 years.
This includes: the prohibition of all night work between 12.00 mid-night and 4 a.m.; the importance of adequate supervision at work; the guarantee of a minimum rest period of 30 minutes if daily working time is 4½ hours or more; and an entitlement to two, preferably consecutive, days of rest which shall, in principle, include a Sunday.
The maximum length of a working day and of a working week for young workers are 8 hours and 40 hours respectively.
By the powers at law, the Prime Minister may prescribe specific working conditions, including terms of remuneration, for workers who are less than 18 years of age.
The national minimum wage applicable for workers aged 16 years and 17 years is slightly less than that of workers of age 18 or above.
Prohibition to discriminate: The right of Maltese citizens to non-discrimination on the basis of sex, race, nationality, religion and political opinion is enshrined in the Constitution.
Non-discrimination is extended by the Act beyond the remit defined by the Constitution to include: marital status, pregnancy or potential pregnancy, sex, colour (meaning race), disability, political opinion, religious conviction or membership in a trade union or employers’ association – but does not include age.
Maltese legislation now includes a specific reference to protection from discrimination in the case of pay for work of equal value; other than and distinct from equal pay for equal work.
The provision of equal pay for equal work has been established at law in Malta since 1976.
Furthermore, other categories of employees, including ‘whistle-blowers’, are also protected from discrimination or victimization.
This includes protection from the possibility of unfair dismissal.
There is no national or sectoral wage fixing machinery, other than that for the weekly minimum wage as described above.
Otherwise, remuneration is determined on the basis of collective bargaining at enterprise level or, in the absence of recognised trade unions, by free individual bargaining.
Part 3 (Articles 11 to 25) of the Employment & Industrial Relations Act addresses this issue in detail.
Wages are to be paid in full, at regular (4 weekly) intervals and directly to the employee concerned, unless the employee determines otherwise, and in legal tender.
In case of insolvency of the employer, any claim by any employee in respect of a maximum of three months of the current wage payable by the employer to the employee, and compensation for leave to which the employee is entitled, together with any compensation due to the employee in consideration of the termination of employment, or any notice thereof, shall constitute a privileged claim over the assets of the employer and shall be paid in preference to all other claims whether privileged or hypothecary.
However, the maximum amount of worker's claim protected by the privilege shall not exceed the equivalent of the national minimum wage payable at the time of the claim over a period of six months.
The Act stipulates the manner in which a trade union is registered with the Director of Employment & Industrial Relations, who doubles up as the Registrar of Trade Unions.
The obligations of registration include: a minimum of seven members; the endorsement and deposition of a statute; an updated membership list on an annual basis; annually audited accounts; and access to its membership records by the Registrar.
Trade Union recognition is referred to, but remains undefined at law.
Practice has it that a trade union which can command the support of a simple majority (50% plus 1) of the workers in a constituency can be reasonably expected to claim to represent such a constituency; employers would then be reasonable expected to recognise such a trade union for the purposes of collective bargaining, on behalf of the same constituency.
The Registrar of Trade Unions may refuse to register a trade union if the applicants have not been duly authorized, the purposes of the trade union are unlawful, or if the application for registration or the rules of the trade union are deemed not to be in conformity with the provisions of the Act.
Similarly, the Registrar of Trade Unions shall cancel the registration of an existing trade union if: the said union has ceased to exist; has less than seven members; is not in conformity with the Act; or has itself applied for cancellation.
In any case, a notice of cancellation will only take effect two months after it is issued, and after the involved party is duly informed.
This allows the trade union concerned the opportunity to choose to make any amends that may be necessary to avoid the cancellation.
Remedies available to an aggrieved trade union in the case of cancellation exist in the form of a complaint lodged in the Court of Appeal.
The reference to unfair practices in Maltese Labour Law is restricted to that of unfair dismissals.
However, the Industrial Tribunal as well as the Civil and Criminal Courts have, over the years, pronounced themselves on this issue.
Another delicate issue is that of trade union indemnity from damages.
There have been cases of industrial action during which equipment has been damaged or broken, possibly willfully, and during which people have been hurt or injured.
Under article 63 of the Law a trade union or an employers’ association can be made liable in respect of
The Employment and Industrial Relations Act defines the "collective agreement" as an agreement entered into between an employer, or one or more organisations of employers, and one or more organisations of employees regarding conditions of employment in accordance with the provisions of any law in force in Malta.
However, the law goes no further in defining what collective agreements are, what they should contain, and how they are meant to be achieved.
The Act’s only reference is to the applicability of the minimum wage and the sector-specific provisions of the Employment Relations Board, in the absence of collective agreements.
However, under article 5 of the Law it is stated that The conditions of employment prescribed in a national standard order, or in a sectoral regulation order, or a collective agreement or determined by voluntary settlement or award under the Title II of this Act, or required to be observed by or under this Act, shall be the recognised conditions of employment for the employees concerned.
This means that the law recognizes legally binding effects to collective agreements, something which departs from the British approach whereby collective agreements are not legally binding.
There existed in April 2002 some 300 collective agreements in the private sector, affecting the conditions of employment of about 30% of Maltese private sector labour.
Some 80 other agreements regulate the conditions of employment in the whole public and quasi-statal sectors.
Most are worked out with the whole enterprise as the constituent base, excluding only top management from its deliberations.
In a few other cases however, the basis of the constituency is that of a ‘specific occupational category’ such as industrial workers or highly specialized staff (pilots, air traffic controllers) or professional employees (architects in the state’s employ; engineers with the energy corporation).
In such cases, there may be more than one collective agreement in force in the same enterprise.
These are typically trade unions on one hand and the management of the respective enterprise on the other.
In the case of public or quasi-public entities, the Ministry of Finance has the final word on the endorsement of decisions which have a bearing on public finance.
The procedure is fairly loose and ill-defined; but the kick-off is usually the notification by a trade union that it commands the majority of the workers it seeks to represent as its members.
Once this is settled (sometimes after industrial action), there is tacit agreement that the parties recognise each other for the purposes of collective bargaining.
Parties may conclude bargaining rounds with an agreement amicably, or after industrial action.
Such agreements usually have a duration of three years, but may extended by agreement between both sides, and will remain valid in the absence of a new agreement coming into force.
An employer may withdraw recognition of a trade union, and therefore suspend collective bargaining, if the membership of the said union falls below that of a simple majority of the workers whom it seeks to represent.
A typical collective agreement in the private sector would have the following clauses:
Malta has a very limited tradition or experience of worker participation other than through trade unions.
For some time, worker committees were appointed in a number of government departments within the civil service in 1978-79, but they fell foul very soon to a competition between the GWU and the UHM, with accusations of such manoeuvres operating within an overall partisan political agenda.
A period of co-determination (1971-1974) followed by fully-fledged self-management (1975-1997) existed at Malta’s then largest firm, Malta Drydocks; but, after chronic losses and the absence of operational reform, the fully-elected board of directors was replaced by a state-appointed board and has today just one elected worker-director.
Other, sole, directors elected by and from the workforce occupy positions on a dozen state or trade union owned or majority-controlled organisations.
There are no workers’ councils or workers’ committees in Malta today.
There are today no experiences of co-determination either.
Otherwise, worker representation is strong and resilient through the ramifications of trade union organisations.
Each trade union would have its own representatives (called shop stewards, in the British tradition) in each enterprise, or part thereof, where it commands representation.
These shop stewards are the points of reference for the rank and file membership and serve as the communication link between the individual member and the central organisation.
A steward would also liaise with a Union Group Committee, nominally active at each workplace.
This Group Committee would be responsible for the coordination of day-to-day issues, as well as for laying the grounds for a new, or revised, collective agreement.
Trade union delegates represent the components of the decision making organs of trade unions, especially in the larger union organisations.
A delegate is elected by the membership in proportion to membership strength and these delegates attend and vote at general meetings or conferences of the trade union.
Worker representatives – such as shop stewards, delegates and members on the group committee – are usually elected for two-year periods.
A call for nominations is issued, formally and informally in the respective workplaces.
As is typical in voluntary, democratic organisations, there is no contestation for the majority of the posts and the incumbents tend to get re-appointed without contest.
Delegates and shop stewards are identified and known to enterprise management and are usually allowed to go about their union work, both on and off the premises, with reasonable freedom.
In the case of the largest unions: GWU, MUT and UHM – a number of senior officials – such as section secretaries - are employed by the trade union, although they need to be reaffirmed in their office every four years.
The state also finances the salary of a number of public officers who are detailed to work as senior union officials “on grounds of public policy”.
The state’s financial support depends on the membership base of the pertinent trade union.
Within the preamble of collective agreements, it is normal to find references to the readiness and commitment of both parties to explore amicable ways of conflict resolution and to the tacit recognition of any strike action as legitimate action of the last resort.
Only registered trade unions or employer associations can convene a strike or a lock-out.
However, they are first expected to register the existence of a trade dispute.
With this indication, and even if the dispute is merely ‘apprehended”, the Director of Employment & Industrial Relations can take the initiative to seek to reconcile the parties.
The Director, or the parties to the dispute, may also refer the matter to a member of a 5-person Conciliation Panel appointed by the Minister responsible for industrial relations.
Should this recourse to voluntary conciliation fail, then the Director informs the Minister who, in turn, has a choice:
Excesses in industrial action are significant test cases of a democratic society.
In the case of the legal but especially illegal actions, the state is usually under strong pressure from specific political factions on the ideological right, as well as in the name of order and justice, to clamp down hard on union freedoms.
On the other hand, such initiatives by the state may be disturbing in a society where, as reported in a February 2002 sample survey, 74% of respondents think that Maltese workers have benefited from the activity of trade unions; 68% agree with the right to a sympathy strike; less than 12% think that trade unions hinder progress; and only 17% think that trade unions obstruct restructuring or protect lazy workers who deserve to be punished.
Indeed, following industrial action in Malta in August 1999, during which some 20 GWU senior officials illegally blocked a public road, they were all taken to court and accused of criminal action.
The much-publicized event led to various court sittings but eventually was abrogated by the granting of a Presidential pardon to the ‘criminals’.
Although rare, lock-outs are legal and constitute legitimate industrial action by employer associations, and usually justified on the basis of protection of capital assets.
The main resort to lock-outs in Maltese industrial relations history has been by the State as an employer with respect to public servants (such as teachers and medical doctors).
there is no definition of a ‘lock-out’ at law; however, an employers’ association enjoys the same rights and indemnities as a trade union with respect to a trade dispute; and it is subjected to a registration procedure similar to that of a trade union.
(f) machinery for negotiation or consultation, and other procedures, relating to any of the foregoing matters, including the recognition by employers or employers' associations of the right of a trade union to represent workers in any such negotiation or consultation or in the carrying out of such procedures;
(g) the membership or non-membership of a worker in a particular trade union;
The Tribunal also has exclusive jurisdiction to consider and decide all cases of alleged unfair dismissal.
The Tribunal works in panels which are made up of a chairperson and two other members, who shall be selected by the Chairperson from panels consisting of persons nominated respectively by trade unions and employers' associations represented on the Malta Council for Economic and Social Development.

Cuts in jobs • cuts in pay • cuts in education
Further education is entering a new phase of crisis.
At least £200 million has been wiped from adult learning budgets for 2010/11 in England and, with a further £300 million of cuts to come over the next three years, more than 1,400 jobs are already under threat.
The Association of Colleges says current cuts could place more than 7,000 jobs at risk.
The job cuts could affect up to 160,000 adult learners on top of the 1.4 million adult learning places lost since 2005.
With every day bringing news of yet more job cuts in our FE colleges, UCU asked FE members to support our joint union day of protest.
Read the reports here: FE national day of protest: 3 July 09
HE trade union side reiterates aims: a nationally agreed process that, if implemented, should avoid compulsory redundancies:
Unions make proposals on HE job security
The HE employers have still not made a single proposal to protect jobs, more than one month since announcing that two-thirds of universities are planning cuts.
UCU and its fellow trade unions have therefore now tabled proposals to try to break the deadlock.
The document, which is supported by UCU, Unison, Unite, GMB and EIS, sets out national standards for institutions to follow where redundancies are proposed.
It would mean universities working in genuine partnership with unions to seriously explore all avenues in order to avoid redundancies and protect provision for students.
A presentation by UCU senior research officer, Stephen Court, on how to do some basic analysis of institutional finances.
The presentation gives some advice on tackling this subject, and presents two examples: City of Sunderland College, and UCL.
Goodell, as part of his weeklong bus trip to seven NFL camps with Hall of Fame coach and broadcasting icon John Madden, initiated locker-room meetings with players at each stop, and the level of interrogation he faced became increasingly charged as players expressed anxiety and anger over a potential lockout next spring.
The owners, particularly a faction of aggressive, entrepreneurial Goodell confidants (Jerry Jones, Robert Kraft, Pat Bowlen, Jerry Richardson) who want a CBA that accounts for the high-risk investments they’ve made on new stadiums and other capital expenditures.
For the most part, the owners are unified in their belief that they agreed to a lousy deal when the current CBA was extended in 2006, and that the players currently receive too great a share of their adjusted gross revenues.
At last March’s NFL owners meeting in Orlando, Fla., the Carolina Panthers ’ Richardson gave a fiery speech in which he exhorted his peers to “take back our league” by forcing a more favorable deal down the throats of the players.
This is likely to be accomplished in the form of a lockout, though it’s possible that the owners could opt for a milder approach: negotiating to impasse and imposing terms of their choosing, which might compel the players to strike.
DeMaurice Smith, the NFLPA’s executive director, is convinced that a lockout is coming, and a majority of his constituents – many of whom are more engaged and informed than is commonly perceived – share this belief.
Do the owners really want the players to take an 18 percent pay cut?
The owners, based on simple economics.
In theory, they could reduce their operating expenses by 50 percent (an estimated $4.4 billion) via the elimination of player salaries and benefits and the temporary layoffs or salary reductions of various other employees.
Meanwhile, thanks to the terms of the extensions to the lucrative TV deals the league has with DirecTV and several broadcast networks, the owners would continue to receive payments during a lockout – though the money would eventually have to be repaid via credits for future games.
Still, that’s a serious cash-flow advantage that would, again in theory, allow the owners to realize more than 50 percent of their revenues (nearly $4 billion) and, therefore, to cover their operating expenses for an entire season if necessary.
Players, meanwhile, would theoretically be much more financially stressed in the short term, and the relatively short career span of NFL players would make the prospect of missing games even more unpalatable.
In June, the NFLPA surprised owners by filing a legal complaint with the Special Master appointed to resolve CBA disputes, challenging the structuring of the television deals.
The NFLPA charged that, in negotiating extensions with DirecTV and at least three networks (Fox, CBS and NBC), the league extended valuable benefits in 2009 and 2010 in exchange for the provisions which would allow the cash flow to continue in the event of a lockout – effectively depriving the players of potential revenues in the short term while setting the stage for a work stoppage.
Owners, citing the fact that similar provisions have been included in past TV deals, seem to think the players have little chance of prevailing.
However, NFLPA executives have been encouraged by early findings during the discovery process that may have documented the league’s intentions, and appear to think that there’s a chance the union’s request to have the TV money placed in an escrow account during a work stoppage may be granted.
Also encouraging to the NFLPA: Any appeal would likely be heard by federal judge David Doty of Minneapolis – the architect of the historic 1993 settlement, which brought unrestricted free agency and a salary cap to the NFL.
In 2008, the league accused Doty of being biased in favor of the union and asked him to remove himself from further handling of CBA-related disputes.
When Doty refused to step aside, the league took its case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit, which rejected the request last November.
Thus, Doty’s involvement, at least on paper, could not be construed as anything but a positive development for the NFLPA.
And remember that, before being voted Upshaw’s successor, Smith was a trial lawyer and litigation partner in an influential Washington firm.
Legal disputes are clearly in his comfort zone.
Who would be the first casualties of a lockout?
The union has broached the possibility of retaliating against the networks who broadcast the league for what it views as a funding of the lockout by advising players to skip out on production meetings and other interview requests.
That may not actually happen, but George Atallah, the NFLPA’s executive director of external affairs, warns, “If there are networks that are not portraying this situation fairly, the players are prepared to act.” The union also sent letters to some of the NFL’s major sponsors reminding them that all marketing deals will cease in the absence of a CBA, impairing companies’ ability to use players or their likenesses in advertising campaigns.
Finally, Smith, who has connections on Capitol Hill, has done some behind-the-scenes lobbying with legislators who might be persuaded to introduce antirust legislation – though such measures would likely come into play only if the situation worsens to the point of triggering a pronounced public outcry.
Absolutely.
Some believe the United Football League, which debuted in ’09 and is about to begin its second season, was launched with a potential lockout in mind.
As one NFL source speculates, “It was the equivalent of betting the Don’t Pass Line in craps – it was banking on a lockout, so it could be there to fill the void.” In theory, the upstart league could rapidly expand beyond its current vision of six teams for the 2011 season and provide jobs for many of the NFL’s high-profile players during a work stoppage.
If there’s a lockout, will there still be a draft next spring?
Migrant workers who in the State of employment are not permitted freely to choose their remunerated activity shall neither be regarded as in an irregular situation nor shall they lose their authorization of residence by the mere fact of the termination of their remunerated activity prior to the expiration of their work permit, except where the authorization of residence is expressly dependent upon the specific remunerated activity for which they were admitted.
Such migrant workers shall have the right to seek alternative employment, participation in public work schemes and retraining during the remaining period of their authorization to work, subject to such conditions and limitations as are specified in the authorization to work.
2.

With regard to safety and health, the paper concludes by identifying knowledge gaps and constraints to implementing RIL, and suggests essential occupational safety and health (OSH) criteria for sustainable forest management that should be taken into account to advance the successful and effective application of RIL.
Forest worker safety and ergonomics have long been a low priority in most countries, whether industrialized or developing.
Detailed cost-benefit analyses of the impact of improved working conditions are still lacking even though the sector is among the most accident-prone.
The importance of costs associated with accidents has not been addressed adequately.
One reason might be that managers often do not know the true cost of accidents.
Typical costs of accidents include:
evacuation, treatment, rehabilitation, where provided, and/or early retirement;
The share of forest workers directly employed by the forest owner or industry has been declining even in those countries where direct employment used to be the rule.
The increasing reliance on contractors and self-employed people often means that the forestry sector has been moving backwards in terms of skill levels, safety and health, working conditions and quality.
Contractors are usually hired only for a specific and relatively short-duration job.
They have to change work sites frequently, often long distances apart.
The shift to contractual arrangements also means that large companies transfer to the contractor labour force problems including safety and health matters, workers’ compensation, regulatory responsibilities, unemployment insurance, fringe benefits and training.
Because of rapid new development, measures to ensure that adequate standards are maintained often lag behind (ILO, 1997b).
In many countries, forestry continues to be seen as a sunset industry.
Compared to other sectors, employment in forestry is often very unstable.
If working conditions are unattractive, turnover is inevitably high, which makes it impossible to stabilize the workforce.
A high labour turnover drains skills, and reduces productivity and earnings.
Consequently, work in forestry becomes the last resort for people with no other alternatives.
So what positive action can be taken for this situation, which is detrimental not only to the forest worker but also to the industry’s profitability?
A step in the right direction has been the development of standards and codes of practice that incorporate safety and health aspects in environmental and productivity requirements.
While setting minimum standards for qualification and working conditions this also improves efficiency in forest operations, which in turn provides a basis for better terms of employment, thus creating a more positive image of the profession.
In most developing countries, at least part of the general OSH legislation is applicable to workers directly employed in forestry, for instance legislation on minimum wages.
However, it is most likely that contract labour and self-employment are not covered.
Additional regulations would be needed for silvicultural operations and tree felling.
Only very few developing countries have issued legally binding safety and health regulations for these operations, which can be enforced by labour inspectors (ILO, 2000).
In many developing countries, labour inspection in forestry has up to now been minimal or non-existent.
Only in rare cases have inspections gained the recognition and support deserved because of the high accident risks, and the difficult and often precarious working conditions.
Some frequent problems facing labour inspectors are:
Also, the shift to contract labour presents particularly difficult challenges for labour inspectors.
In view of these constraints, the impact of labour inspections on OSH and working conditions in many developing countries remains limited until the forestry sector accepts part of this responsibility through self-regulation and self-inspection.
A good example is Zimbabwe where fatality rates dropped from seven per year to none, following an industry-led safety campaign in 1996.
Also the introduction of codes of forest practice and certification schemes have proved to be an efficient tool to bring about improvements gradually (ILO, 1997c; Wells, 1999).
Ideally, labour inspectors should participate in the formulation of codes of forest practice.
It would also be desirable for labour inspectors to be associated with code monitoring teams and to take care of labour aspects during monitoring.
This would be an excellent opportunity to introduce labour inspection into forest operations and help to overcome the logistical problems faced by labour inspectors.
The FAO model code of forest harvesting practice (Dykstra and Heinrich, 1996) also identified the “development of a competent and properly motivated workforce” as one of four essential ingredients in forest harvesting operations if forests are to be managed on a sustainable basis.
The statement also applies to forest operations other than harvesting.
The Code provides several recommendations that clearly would contribute to improved working conditions, raise the status of forest workers and curb labour turnover.
It has been consulted extensively in the development of several national codes and has been an effective means in promoting the incorporation of social and labour aspects into forest management.
Part I lays down general principles, sets out a legal framework conducive to safety and health in forest work and spells out the general duties of the numerous actors involved in the sector from authorities, employers, managers, supervisors, contractors and workers to labour inspectors, accident insurers and machine manufacturers.
Forest managers, supervisors and foremen must be aware of training requirements and must organize work and provide working conditions so as to ensure that the skills of trained workers are used fully.
Since 1994, the ILO has assisted in training programs for labour inspectors in forestry.
Typically the courses last for one week of theory and practical applications.
Practical training includes visits to workplaces where demonstrations and exercises are carried out on the use of checklists on working conditions, working techniques and tools and machines.
After each presentation or demonstration, participants are requested to prepare checklists to be used in inspection work.
This exercise often leads to intensive discussions among participants and raises the absorption of the course content.
The checklists are then used during field visits and amended afterwards by pooling the best elements from the groups.
At the end of the course the inspectors receive a full set of the checklists they had developed themselves.
Such checklists facilitate a systematic approach by inspectors who are generalists, rather than forestry experts.
These courses are also beneficial for safety and forestry officers who are engaged in self-inspection and code monitoring.
be difficult to implement unless acceptable OSH and working conditions contribute to stabilize the work force and enable skill development; and
not provide better market access through certification (and probably not to carbon credits) nor be in compliance with codes of practice, unless they meet essential social and labour standards.

In July 2003, the new labor law (Law 12 of 2003) went into effect with the stated goal of fostering an atmosphere that would support and move forward the privatization process.
Although the law reorganized the procedures under which a private corporation can hire or fire its employees, it was far from perfect: the nation is still high on the World Bank’s Rigidity of Employment index for the strength of its work contracts and stringent barriers to their termination even in cases of bankruptcy.
In addition to standard identification information, the contract must explicitly include the following information: a comprehensive job description, the wage agreed upon, the method of payment and the probation period, which should not exceed three months.
The standard legal work schedule is eight hours per day, six days per week.
Work days must include at least one break of not less than one hour for meals and rest.
Employees are also granted a minimum of 24 unbroken hours of rest per week.
In other words: private sector employees on a five-day workweek, thank your employers.
They are giving you 52 free days of unpaid leave every year.
The law stipulates that no employee should work more than 10 hours (work hours plus overtime) in any 24-hour period.
An employer does not have the right to force a female employee to work during the first 45 days following the delivery.
Furthermore, an employer is prohibited from discharging a female employee or terminating her contract during her maternity leave, giving her more job security.
Female employees also have the right to take a further two years unpaid leave twice during their career with a company without any threat to their job security.
However, if no settlement is reached, both parties may resort to an arbitration committee to file a case within a period of 45 days at most.
The committee must be composed of two judges, a representative of the Ministry of Manpower and Immigration, and two members of the Federation of Egyptian Trade Unions.
The compensation determined by the committee should not be less than a two-month salary.
The law makes it clear that an employer who faces harsh economic conditions during uncommon events like privatization or recession cannot dismiss any of its employees.
Downsizing the corporation or merging it with another does not allow the company to terminate employment contracts, although it may reduce pay or modify the labor contract to include additional tasks.
As for a company going out of business, the employer has the right to lay off his or her workers to eliminate all liabilities.
The legal procedures necessary to do this are as follows: The employer has to justify to an ad hoc committee of government and union officials the reasons for taking such an action, as well as state the numbers and ranks of employees that need to be terminated.
The employees have the right to object to any decisions taken by this committee, which will result in the formation of another ad hoc committee representing the employees.
Both committees have to include representatives of the General Federation of Egyptian Trade Unions.
The committees will try to balance between the interests of the corporation and those of the employees, taking into consideration the seniority, family burdens and vocational skills of employees.
Does the law grant employees the right to strike or object to certain work conditions?
The law has granted employees the right to organize a strike, with no threat to their job security, under the supervision of their trade union organizations in defense of their vocational, economic and social interests.
Trade unions are responsible for notifying employers of the date and the reason of the strike at least 10 days before it takes place.
However, organizing strikes is prohibited if they result in any disturbance to national security or delay services provided to citizens.
Foreigners working in Egypt have to present their legal work permits beforehand.
The law also constrains the hiring of foreigners to a ratio of one foreigner to ten Egyptians, and all labor laws apply to Egyptians and foreigners equally.
In addition to gaining work permits from whatever country they end up working in, Egyptians seeking to work abroad also have to obtain a legal work permit from Egypt.
They should also submit a description of the nature and requirements of their profession and copies of their labor contracts as well as state the negotiated salary.
The law apparently does not tolerate gender discrimination as stated in Article 88: “All employment regulations and policies should apply to female employees equalizing their status to that of their male counterparts without discrimination as long as their work conditions are analogous.”
Public sector workers including health employees, firefighters and police are set to join a demonstration on 21 September against government plans to cut civil service pay in 2011.
The proposals are part of the budget cuts put forward by the new government and the health union warns of the risk that the cuts could be deeper than the 10% being talked about.
Unions are also concerned about planned government reforms of the Labour Code which they believe are aimed at weakening employee rights to make the labour market more “flexible”.

A pay agreement for 2011 has been negotiated in the civil service but with only one union federation, Memur-Sen, supporting the increase.
Both Kamu-Sen and KESK left the negotiations at different points in protest at the way they were being run by the government.
KESK also wanted the negotiations postponed until after the referendum and the possibility that unions would have a clear right to strike if constitutional changes are agreed.
The negotiations will deliver two 4% pay increases in each half of 2011 plus TL80 (€41) for all workers.

All EPSU affiliates are being urged to reply to the questionnaire on equal pay that was sent out earlier this year.
This is a vital issue for EPSU with two resolutions passed on the subject at last year’s Congress.
So far we have had 14 responses from nine EU Member States and two Eastern European countries.
This means we have a long way to go before getting a comprehensive picture of pay inequality and action to close the gender pay gap in the public services.

The WSI trade union research institute has found that regional authorities are pursuing various possibilities to set up or re-establish procurement rules that require contractors to bide by relevant collective agreements.
They have been reviewing the situation since 2008 when the European Court ruled against Lower Saxony in the Rüffert case.
Following the case 10 regional authorities set aside their procurement rules.
Now four have introduced new rules and five are planning changes this autumn.
The authorities are using sectoral minimum wages as a basis for their new rules or are taking advantage of the fact that special rules apply to the transport sector.
Two regional authorities have also introduced minimum wages specific to procurement.

UK - Local government employers in Scotland impose pay freeze
Unions have reacted angrily to the decision by the COSLA Scottish local government employers to impose a pay freeze on 150,000 council workers.
COSLA had offered a three-year deal with 1% in 2010, 0% in 2011 and 0.5% in 2012.
This was rejected by unions but instead of negotiating the employers have moved to impose a worse deal with a 0.65% increase this year followed by two years of pay freeze.

Services union VIDA is supporting the ÖGB trade union confederation’s campaigning around equal pay and the Equal Pay Day planned for 29 September.
The date was chosen to correspond to the 25.6% gender pay gap in Austria, represented by the idea that if men and women both work full-time for a year the pay gap means that on average women are unpaid for the final three months of the year.
The union stresses that equal pay for work of equal value is not just a question of fairness but would also mean an important boost to the economy.

The Fagforbundet municipal union has broken off negotiations over a new two-year agreement with the church employers.
A key matter for dispute is over pay for workers with 20 years’ service and the union says that the employers’ current offer would leave this group of workers around €885 a year worse off than workers with 20 years’ service covered by similar collective agreements.
The dispute now goes to arbitration.

The Federal Legislative List , which identifies the subjects within the sole legislative purview of Parliament, is divided into two parts.
Legislation on items in the first part, which includes national defense, nationality and citizenship, foreign affairs, civil service and a wide range of other items, must be introduced in the National Assembly.
If passed by the National Assembly, the bill is then forwarded to the Senate for consideration.
Within a period of ninety days, the Senate may either pass the bill with or without amendment, or reject it entirely.
If the Senate should fail to take any action on the bill within the prescribed period of time, the bill is deemed to have been passed without amendment.
It then moves on to the President for assent and for publication as an act of Parliament.
An amended or rejected bill must be reconsidered by the National Assembly and, if it is again passed by that body, with or without amendment, the bill is forwarded to the President for his or her assent.
All other proposed legislation, bills relating to items in the second part of the Federal Legislative List or in the Concurrent Legislative List may be introduced in either house.
The Concurrent Legislative List found in Article 70(4) of the Constitution, includes provisions for the welfare of labor: conditions of labor, employer's liability, workers’ compensation and health insurance; trade unions, industrial and labor disputes; establishment of and carrying on of labor exchanges, employment information bureaus and training establishments; regulation of labor and safety in mines, factories and oil- fields; and unemployment insurance.
Bills originating from the second part of the Federal Legislative List or the Concurrent List are sent to the President for his or her signature.
If within seven days, he or she fails to do so, the bill automatically becomes an act of Parliament.
With reference to specific types of cases, in particular labour disputes, Special Courts for Trial of Offenses and Tribunals have been created.
Appeals from the Special Courts are generally submitted to the High Courts, with the exception of Labour Courts, which retain separate forums of appeal.
Article 11 of the Constitution prohibits all forms of slavery, forced labour and child labour;
Pakistan’s labour laws trace their origination to legislation inherited from India at the time of partition of the Indo-Pak subcontinent.
The laws have evolved through a continuous process of trial to meet the socio-economic conditions, state of industrial development, population and labour force explosion, growth of trade unions, level of literacy, Government’s commitment to development and social welfare.
To meet the above named objectives, the government of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan has introduced a number of labour policies, since its independence to mirror the shifts in governance from martial law to democratic governance.
All terminations of service in any form must be documented in writing stating the reasons for such an act.
If a worker is aggrieved by an order of termination he or she may proceed under Section 46 of the Industrial Relations Ordinance 2002, aimed at regulating the labour-management relations in the country, and bring his or her grievance to the attention of his or her employer, in writing, either him or herself, through the shop steward or through his or her trade union within three months of the occurrence of the cause of action.
Forms of termination have been described as removed, retrenched, discharged or dismissed from service.
To safeguard against any colorful exercise of power, victimization or unfair labour practices, the Labour Courts have been given powers to examine and intervene to find out whether there has been a violation of the principles of natural justice and whether any action by the employer was bonafide or unjust.
The Joint Works Council deals with matters, which were of the competency of the earlier Joint Management Board, such as the improvement in production, productivity and efficiency, provision of minimum facilities for those of the workers employed through contractors who are not covered by the laws relating to welfare of workers.
It has also taken up tasks of the previous Works Council, i.e.
promoting settlement of differences through bilateral negotiations, promoting conditions of safety and health for the workers, encouraging vocational training within the establishment, taking measures for facilitating good and harmonious working conditions in the establishment, provision of educational facilities for children of workers.
Registration of a trade union is to be made under the Industrial Relations Ordinance.
Workers’ trade unions are registered with the Registrar Trade Unions in the Province, and if the industry or establishment is nationwide with the National Industrial Relations Commission, after fulfilling a number of requirements, listed in Article 6 of the IRO 2002.
Through its registration, the trade union obtains certain benefits: registration confers a legal existence as an entity separate from its members.
Trade unions in Pakistan generally function on plant-wide basis, with their membership contingent on the size of the industry/trade to which they belong.
Once established, the trade unions and employers' associations have the right to draw up their constitutions and rules, to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organize their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes.
To determine the representative character of the trade union in industrial disputes and to obtain representation on committees, boards and commissions, the Industrial Relations Ordinance makes provision for the appointment of a Collective Bargaining Agent (CBA).
The CBA is a registered trade union elected by secret ballot.
The CBA is entitled to undertake collective bargaining with the employer or employers on matters connected with employment, non-employment, the terms of employment or any right guaranteed or secured to it or any worker by or under any law, or any award or settlement.
Collective agreements are thus formulated by the CBA.
The agreements may contain matters such as the facilities in the establishment for trade union activities and procedures for settling collective disputes including grievances and disciplinary procedures.
Substantive provisions settle terms and conditions of employment, wages and salaries, hours of work, holiday entitlement and pay, level of performance, job grading, lay-offs, retrenchment, sick pay, pension and retirement schemes.
Such agreements once duly executed by both parties become the source of law.
The agreements should invariably be in writing and should be drafted with care, for they are meant to settle disputes rather than raise them.
In addition to statutory benefits under the labour laws, the adjustment of rights takes place through collective bargaining including adjudication in Labour Courts.
The IRO 2002 has changed the appellate procedure on the provincial level, which used to be brought before a Labour Appellate Tribunal.
This institution was abolished by the IRO 2002.
Appeals of Labour Court decisions now lie directly with provincial High Courts.
Office bearers of trade unions are given protection against arbitrary transfer, discharge and dismissal.
Any ill-intentioned action on the part of the employer against an office-bearer of a trade union or against a worker for trade union activities, is construed as an unfair practice and the National Industrial Relations Commission is entrusted with the task of preventing such offenses.
Security of service is ensured to the workers.
Similarly, unfair labour practices on the part of workers and trade unions is elaborated and incorporated in law.
If dispute settlement proceedings before the Conciliator fail and no settlement is reached, and if the parties have not agreed to refer their dispute to an arbitrator, the workers retain the right under section 31 of the Industrial Relations Ordinance 2002, to go on strike providing due notice to their employer within seven days, and the employer has the right declare a lock-out after the delay of notice of conciliation has expired.
The party raising a dispute retains the option, at any time, either before or after the commencement of a strike or lockout, to make an application to the Labour Court for adjudication of the dispute.
Under section 32 of the IRO 2002, if a strike or lockout occurs within the public utility services sector the Federal Government and the Provincial Government may, by order in writing, also prohibit its occurrence at any time before or after the commencement of the strike or lockout.
No party to an industrial dispute may go on strike or declare a lockout during the course of conciliation or arbitration proceedings, or while proceedings are pending before the Labour Court.
In addition, the National Industrial Relations Commission (the Commission), adjudicates and determines industrial disputes to which an industry-wise trade union or federation of such trade unions is a party , as well as disputes which are of national importance.
A strike or lockout is declared illegal if it is commenced without giving notice of conciliation to the other party of the dispute, or if it is commenced or continued in a manner other than that provided by the IRO 2002 or in contravention with this text.
In case of an illegal strike or lockout, an Officer from the Labour Department may make a report to the Labour Court, and require the employer or CBA or the registered trade union concerned, to appear before the Court.
The Court may, within 10 days, order the strike or lockout to be stopped.
In case of contravention of the order of the Court by the workers, the Labour Court may pass orders of dismissal against the striking workers, or cancel the registration of the trade union that committed such contravention.

The ILO has in 2003 declared 28 April the World Day for Safety and Health at Work, focusing international attention on the magnitude of the problem and how promoting and creating a safety and health culture can help to reduce the number of work-related deaths each year.
The trade union movement has organized the International Commemoration Day for Dead and Injured Workers worldwide since 1996 coordinated by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU).
Safe work is at the heart of the ILO’s Decent Work Agenda.
It is essential to achieving all four of the ILO’s strategic objectives.
Many of the international standards created since the ILO was founded in 1919 address issues related to occupational safety and health.
Work can only be decent if it is safe and healthy.
Occupational safety and health falls squarely into the category of social protection.
And successful social dialogue is one of the key tools in making work safe and healthy.
The ILO created a new tool to contribute to achieving safe and decent work.
The Promotional Framework for Occupational Safety and Health Convention, 2006 (No.
187) was adopted by the most recent International Labour Conference.
As a framework Convention, it is designed to provide for a coherent and systematic treatment of occupational safety and health.
The Promotional Framework may also serve to promote recognition of existing Conventions.
The new Convention requires member States to promote continuous improvement of occupational safety and health in order to prevent occupational injuries, diseases and deaths.
It foresees three main tools to achieve this aim:
According to the Convention, the national policy should serve to promote a safe and healthy working environment.
Its delivery is ensured by an infrastructure known as the national system for occupational safety and health.
The system should consist of institutional mechanisms, such as laws, regulations and responsible authorities, as well as activities such as the provision of both tripartite and technical information and advice, training and education, occupational health services, research, and the collection of data on accidents and diseases.
Against this background, a national programme should be developed, consisting of a predetermined time frame, priorities and means of action formulated to improve occupational safety and health, and crucially some means of assessing progress.
Last year over 100 countries celebrated World Day for Safety and Health at Work.
Events ranged from speeches held by leaders from government, employers' organisations and trade unions to exhibitions focusing on occupational safety and health and displays of traditional dancing.
There were also podium discussions and workshops and extensive media coverage.
For more information see the web site
According to ILO estimates, each year two million men and women die from work-related diseases and accidents - a death toll averaging some 5,000 workers a day.
Globalization is affecting occupational safety and health in a variety of ways, some positive, some negative.
A strong safety and health culture in all enterprises is a key step towards both preventing occupational deaths and diseases and tackling related effects of globalization.
The ILO World Day for Safety and Health is bringing tripartite strength to the International Commemoration Day for Dead and Injured Workers organized worldwide by the trade union movement since 1996 and coordinated by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU).
The World Day for Safety and Health at Work is intended to focus international attention on the magnitude of the problem and how promoting and creating a safety and health culture can help to reduce the number of work-related deaths each year.

A journeyman electrician carries a lot of responsibility on a job site.
He or she is qualified to perform just about any sort of electrical work, barring those tasks reserved for master electricians.
In addition to their skill at installation and maintenance of all manner of electrical components, journeyman electricians may also find themselves in a managerial position, teaching and supervising apprentice electricians.
It's a position requiring years of work and training, much of which is difficult to get without first joining a union or trade organization.
Once an electrician receives the rank of journeyman, however, the typical electrician salary is quite comfortable.
Perhaps "electrician salary" isn't the best term, though - most journeyman electricians are still paid by the hour.
When conducting your electrician salary research, it's a good idea to also research electrician hourly wages in order to compare and contrast.
The Electrician Wages by Years Experience chart shows that a journeyman electrician who's been in the position for less than a year often makes between $12.00 and $18.00 an hour.
Keep in mind, though, that these are journeyman electrician wages - that year or less of experience is coming on top of a three to five year apprenticeship.
The kind of certification that is required of an electrician will vary from state to state.
Researching Electrician Hourly Wages by Certification , we can see that, overall, general contractors tend to earn the highest electrician hourly wages.
Electrician wages themselves also vary from state to state.
Check out the Electrician Salary by State report to see how your state stacks up.
Every paid-up affiliated union (at the beginning of 2002 there were nearly 600) is entitled to send delegates.
The number of votes each union has varies according to the strength of its declared transport worker membership.
Unions can bring with them non-voting advisers.
Also present will be observers from non-affiliated organisations including the other nine International Trade Secretariats (ITSs) and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) plus several guests of honour.
The motions address changes in the international trade union movement and the development of “Global Unions”.
This includes the ICFTU’s “Millennium Review” which is reassessing how the major institutions of the international trade union movement relate to each other, so as to create a more dynamic global unionism.
They look at how the union movement relates to the wider world of popular movements and non-governmental organisations concerned with how to control the globalisation process.
An ITF action programme is proposed to build active links and broad alliances with movements and NGOs (non-governmental organisations) that are supportive of trade union goals.
They draw on the lessons of “Mobilising Solidarity” to examine how to build even closer co-operation between the ITF and its member unions.
François Yverneau of the road transport branch of the French Transport Workers’ Federation (FGTE –CFDT) retired in September 2001, at the age of 64, after an association with the union going back nearly 30 years, the last 10 as a full-time official.
He was very active within the ITF, helping contribute to efforts at European Union level to secure a better deal for road transport workers, especially on the issue of working time.
At home he was a leading member of the union team who secured early retirement for truckers, a significant achievement.
He was awarded the French national order of merit in 2001.
A decade later he left Malawi for Zimbabwe where he continued his railway career with the National Railways and his trade union career with the Railway Association of Enginemen, first as a member of the executive and a year later, then aged just 37, as its General Secretary.
This was a post he was to hold until 1987 when his union became one of three that joined forces to become the Zimbabwe Amalgamated Railwaymen’s Union (ZARU).
Lovemore took over as ZARU’s first Assistant General Secretary and in 1990 he took the post of General Secretary, running the union’s administration with great skill and dedication during a period of considerable political upheaval.
Ben Udogwu, ITF Regional Secretary for Africa, commented: “In this capacity, Shana represented workers in all transport sectors with energy and sincerity.
He earned wide respect for the ITF through his outstanding performance at meetings of the Southern African Transport and Telecommunications Commission (an agency of the Southern African Development Community) with which he enjoyed consultative status.
He supported the creation of an integrated sub-regional transport network with greatly improved road and rail links, as a means of boosting the prosperity of the Southern Africa region.
“Shana was a man of acute trade union instincts who discharged his duties with incredible dedication.
His services and friendship will be greatly missed.”
Abstract.
We estimate the fraction of hidden unemployment in the disability insurance (DI) inflow rate on the basis of a longitudinal administrative data set of Dutch employers for the period 1994–2003.
This fraction can be identified by imposing so-called exclusion restrictions on variables that are thought to impact the layoff rate but not disability risk.
We find that the fraction of hidden unemployment in DI inflow amounts to 11 per cent.
This implies that 2.6 per cent of all layoffs took place via the DI scheme.
In addition, we find that this share has declined substantially over time, suggesting that various policy measures taken have been effective.
By now, there is a substantial body of empirical research that addresses the effects of social insurance on labour supply (see Krueger and Meyer, 2002 for a survey).
This research seems of particular interest for many Western European countries, where the relative generosity of the welfare state has led to substantial hidden unemployment within social security arrangements.
In addition, recent empirical evidence also points at hidden unemployment in the disability scheme in the USA.
The latter is relevant as well for the Netherlands, where the disability insurance (DI) scheme was found to contain much hidden unemployment.
Consequently, many policy measures aimed at firms were initiated in order to curb the use of DI as an alternative to the ‘official’ unemployment scheme.
In particular, various forms of experience rating were introduced in sickness absenteeism and DI from the early 1990s on.
In addition, requirements of employers during the sickness period (i.e.
the period preceding disability assessment) were made more severe.
Yet, the extent to which these reforms have been successful in curbing hidden unemployment in the DI scheme is unknown.
In this paper, we contribute to the empirical literature by providing explicit estimates for the degree of hidden unemployment in the Dutch DI scheme.
In addition, we are able to estimate the time pattern of this hidden component, and hence deduce implicitly whether the various policy reforms taken have been effective.
Although we are not able to explicitly quantify the isolated effects of the various policy measures taken, the time pattern still indicates whether the complete reform package has been effective.
In contrast to previous studies, the (administrative) longitudinal data set we use allows us to control for unobserved firm-specific effects, thus improving the reliability of estimates.
We address the layoff decision from the viewpoint of the firm — the argument being that most policies to curb hidden unemployment in the DI scheme have been directed towards firms.
Within the context of our model, a firm wants to lay off a worker when the cost of extending the contract exceeds the benefits to the firm.
1 Whether such a layoff is labelled ‘Unemployment’ or ‘Disability’ is only relevant to the extent that it affects the firm's layoff costs ( Aarts and de Jong, 1992 ).
Because of the imperfect verifiability of worker health, there is scope for using DI as an alternative to the ‘official’ unemployment insurance (UI) scheme.
Thus, relatively high layoff costs in the UI scheme may induce the employer to (make an attempt to) lay off workers through the DI scheme.
Second, procedures for firing employees may be complicated, and are often time-consuming and (therefore) costly.
A third argument for over-using the DI scheme is that the DI scheme is more generous than the UI scheme, thus increasing the willingness of workers to accept the scheme.

Similar to earlier work in this field, we identify substitution from UI to DI by making use of exclusion restrictions.
That is, it is assumed that variables related to the firm's wage bill should in theory not affect DI inflow, whereas at the same time there is reason to believe that these variables should affect the layoff rate.
Generally, the firm's cost of employing a worker is highly determined by the worker's wage level.
Thus, if correlation is found between the concerning variables and DI inflow, then this can be considered as evidence for hidden unemployment in DI inflow.
In addition, we use a proxy variable for the (sectoral) business cycle for identifying this substitution effect (assuming that DI inflow should in theory not be affected by the business cycle).
Following Wooldridge (2002 ), we include employer averaged values of variables in the (Tobit) regressions of the UI and DI inflow rates, so as to prevent our estimates to suffer from omitted variable bias.
We also take into account that there may exist some ‘natural correlation’ between DI and UI inflow, which may, for example, be the case if low productivity workers with both high UI and DI risks are concentrated within particular firms.
By explicitly modelling such natural correlation, we are able to obtain more precise estimates for the amount of hidden unemployment.
The empirical analysis shows that hidden unemployment is the major determinant of the observed correlation of UI and DI inflow rates of firms.
We estimate that 11 per cent of the observed DI inflow rate in 1994–2003 exists of hidden unemployment (which is equivalent to 3 per cent of all dismissals being channelled into the DI scheme).
When estimating the model for separate years, we find that this share has decreased dramatically, from 38 per cent in 1994 to about 3 per cent in most recent years.
From this, we conclude that the various policies have been effective in discouraging the use of DI as an alternative layoff scheme.
Earlier studies by Riphahn (1997 ) and Hassink et al.
(1997 ) present empirical models where the magnitude of substitution effects is addressed explicitly.
Riphahn (1997 ) tests the hypothesis that variables affecting the ‘risk’ of early retirement affect the risk of disability retirement similarly.
For some characteristics, like age, wage, and job characteristics, risk structures appear to be very similar.
However, the effects do not coincide with respect to the individual health and aggregate employment measures, which indicates that both schemes are not complete substitutes.
Rather than testing the hypothesis that the inflow in the two schemes are full substitutes, Hassink et al.
(1997 ) model the extent of substitution between UI and DI as a structural parameter that can be estimated.
Identification of this parameter hinges upon exclusion restrictions.
With employer survey data, Hassink et al.
(1997 ) use variables like (lagged) quits and dismissals, as well as the training period per firm as exclusion restrictions for the inflow into UI.
In a similar vein, working conditions, and the number of workers on sick leave are assumed to affect the inflow into DI only.
With this information, they find that between 6 and 9 per cent of all dismissals are channelled into the DI scheme.
In a recent paper, Koning and van Vuuren (2006 ) apply a similar methodology as Hassink et al.
(1997 ) and the current article, but estimate their model on a considerably smaller sample of employers, which only allows for the identification of a constant fraction of hidden unemployment in DI.
The authors estimate the fraction of dismissals through DI at 3 per cent for the years 1993–2002.
3
Over the years, the Dutch DI system has repeatedly been subject to public debate.
Expressed as a percentage of the insured population, the stock of DI recipients peaked at 16 per cent in the mid-1980s, and since then has declined and stabilized at about 13 per cent.
There is strong evidence that the DI scheme was used as a substitute pathway into both unemployment and early retirement.
Using medical information of the 1980 cohort of DI entrants, Aarts and de Jong (1992 ) estimate a structural share of hidden unemployment of 33–51 per cent.
Based on aggregate (time-series) data, Westerhout (1996 ) estimates that about half of the DI recipients in the period 1973–92 exists of hidden unemployment.
Finally, Hassink et al.
(1997 ) find a fraction of 10 per cent of hidden unemployment in DI inflow for the years 1988 and 1990.
It is however still an open question whether the share of hidden unemployment in DI remains as important nowadays as it used to be in the 1970s and 1980s.
In contrast to the DI scheme, UI entitlement is restricted to workers who meet minimal work history conditions.
In particular, there are two criteria that determine eligibility, as well as the entitlement period of UI.
In order to become eligible to the UI scheme, workers must have earned wages in at least 26 of the 39 past weeks.
However, if the worker has not earned wages in at least four out of the five most recent calendar years, then the UI benefit scheme is virtually equivalent to the social assistance benefits, and the entitlement period is six months.
If the worker meets the four-out-of-five condition, then the scheme is wage-related and equals 70 per cent of the wage in the job previous to unemployment, where the entitlement period is a step function of the work history.
At present, the minimum entitlement period equals six months, whereas the maximum entitlement period equals five years for workers.
Together with the non-statutory arrangements made by social partners, this makes the UI scheme rather attractive as an exit route into early retirement.
In particular, some collective agreements supplement the UI scheme to 90 per cent or 80 per cent of the previous wage earnings and extend the entitlement spell.
We define DI and UI inflow rates per employer as the percentage of workers that enrols into the DI or UI scheme while being under contract by that firm.
Consequently, two types of underreporting may occur.
First, underreporting may result from the fact that we do not count the inflow of workers with combined DI and UI benefits, amounting to 0.17 per cent of the number of employees of an average firm in our sample.
In full-time equivalents, this effect corresponds to 16 per cent of the total DI inflow rate and 1.4 per cent of the total UI inflow rate.
The inclusion of combined DI and UI inflow rates would bias our estimation results of the amount of hidden unemployment upwards: as DI and UI inflow rates are measured in terms of the fractions of workers in firm observations, the correlation between both rates that results from combined benefits would be fully interpreted as substitution between the two schemes.
A second source of underreporting is confined to the UI inflow rates only.
In particular, our definition of UI inflow exclusively looks at the immediate worker flow from work into unemployment, whereas the situation may be more subtle in the somewhat longer term.
There may be delays in assigning UI inflow to specific employers for which we cannot trace back the initial date of UI inflow.
As a result of this, the extent of underreporting in the UI inflow rate equals 21 per cent of the total inflow rate.
In conclusion, the DI and UI inflow rates per firm in our sample are on average both undervalued by about one-fifth.
Our approach improves on the studies just mentioned in three aspects.
First, the longitudinal data set used allows us to control for unobserved firm-specific effects.
We discuss the incorporation of such effects in Section 4.2 .
Second, we allow UI and DI risks to be correlated, apart from correlation that results from hidden unemployment.
We label this correlation as natural correlation, or effects that are exogenous to the firm.
Such natural correlation may, for example, arise if low productivity workers at the same time face relatively high disability and unemployment risks.
If these workers are concentrated in particular firms, then the DI and UI risks of employers will be correlated as well.
Ignoring such statistical correlation may produce a biased estimate of the fraction of hidden unemployment in DI inflow (this is worked out in more detail in the Appendix ) — the observed correlation will then be misperceived as causal or substitution effects.
Third, we are able to estimate hidden unemployment for separate years, which may reveal a specific pattern over time.
The latter is particularly interesting, as it indicates whether the various policy reforms have been effective.
In this subsection we proceed by explaining the behavioural model of the firm.
The second and third step are discussed in the two following subsections.
Firms decide to lay off a certain fraction of their workforce (f0), and at the same time a proportion of workers is lost as a result of ‘true disability’ (d0).
However, as was mentioned in the introduction, firms may experience incentives to redirect layoffs through the DI scheme.
Thus, the firm avoids UI experience rating and firing costs 10 and DI benefits may be more acceptable to the worker than UI benefits.
Together with the imperfect monitoring of disability, these incentives make it conceivable that some transitions into DI are in fact hidden unemployment, with the latter being defined as the difference between the actual DI inflow rate and the ‘true DI incidence rate’.
Defining f as the observed layoff rate, and d as the observed DI inflow rate, we may reformulate this mathematically as
Obviously, our primary goal is to estimate λ.
The fraction of hidden unemployment in the DI inflow can be derived from this parameter straightforwardly, as both f and d are observed:
4.3 Recovering the share of hidden unemployment
In the third step we recover the share of hidden unemployment from the reduced-form estimates.
Comparing the reduced-form Tobit equations in [3] to the behavioural model in [1], it is clear that the reduced-form specification must somewhere implicitly contain the structural parameter λ.
In this subsection, we seek to identify this parameter by imposing exclusion restrictions on the reduced-form parameters.
In practice, this means that we postulate that some variables should in theory not affect the disability incidence rate, whereas they could well affect the layoff decision of the firm.
If it is found that these variables do affect the DI inflow rate, then we consider this as evidence of hidden unemployment in DI.
Firms compare the costs and benefits of employment, and, in principle, decide to lay off a worker whenever the costs exceed the benefits.
Although the wage level is one of the principal determinants of the costs involved with employment, it is to be expected that this variable is also one of the principal determinants of the layoff decision of the firm.
On the other hand, it may be expected a priori that the employee wage distribution does not affect the inflow in the DI scheme.
More specifically, workers are insured against any loss of income that is due to the risk of disability.
Thus, in the absence of hidden unemployment, the absolute level of wages does not affect the DI inflow rate.
We therefore use wage quartiles as exclusion restrictions in our benchmark model.
13 Second, the sectoral wage sum growth can be considered as an indicator of the business cycle, onlyaffecting the ‘true’ UI inflow rate.
We will use this variable to check for the robustness of our results.
close to zero, the correlation between DI inflow and UI inflow that results from hidden unemployment can be approximated by
) in the reduced-form model.
The importance of hidden unemployment is also mirrored by other parameter estimates, in particular those in the equation for the DI inflow rate.
In contrast to the reduced-form estimates, we find that the ‘true’ DI inflow rate increases with age.
Basically, our estimate of λ for 1994–2003 is identified from the exclusion restrictions imposed on the wage quartile coefficients.
The reduced-form estimates for UI inflow indicate that high-wage firms are more likely to dismiss workers.
For DI inflow, we find the reduced-form coefficients to be less pronounced — i.e.
only for the first wage quartile, we find the effect on DI inflow to be positive and significant.
This suggests that hidden unemployment in DI is most prevalent for low-wage workers.
, so that we have unique values for our structural parameters.
For the inflow into the full DI scheme, the estimated fraction of hidden unemployment is 15 per cent.
For the partial scheme, we find similar effects (18 per cent).
Table 4 also makes apparent that the hidden component in DI inflow has decreased substantially over time.
In 1994, nearly 40 per cent of the DI inflow rate is estimated to consist of hidden unemployment, whereas for 1999–2003 this percentage was only 2–4 per cent.
This decrease can mainly be attributed to a lower proportion of layoffs that is directed to DI, and has further been aggravated by a lower (total) layoff rate.
These findings suggest that the various policies aimed at discouraging substitution from UI to DI have indeed been effective.
20 Particularly in the time intervals 1994–96 and 1998–99, the hidden UI component in DI inflow has decreased substantially.
In a way, these results are surprising, as DI inflow rates in our sample started to decrease not earlier than in 1998.
We therefore conclude that, with constant substitution rates, the DI inflow rate would have been substantially higher until 1999.
Moreover, decreases in the DI inflow rates in more recent years cannot be explained by a lower inflow of dismissals.
Rather than substitution between the schemes, it seems that preventative effects have reduced the worker injury risk, but also a general increase in the health level may have contributed to this, albeit to a limited extent (see, for example, Koning, 2004 ).
Notes: a In the benchmark model we identify the share of hidden unemployment from the imposition of exclusion restrictions on wage quartiles (also see Table 4 ).
In the alternative model (ii) we use yearly wage sum growth per sector as an exclusion restriction.
In the second alternative model (iii) we again use the exclusion restrictions of the benchmark model, but we include higher-order polynomials of the average values of the explanatory variables, as suggested by Zabel (1992 ).
In this paper, we construct and estimate a (semi-)structural model, so as to uncover the size of hidden unemployment in the DI inflow rate.
For this purpose, we use longitudinal administrative data for the Netherlands over the period 1994–2003.
In principle, the estimation procedure we propose can be applied to various types of data sets, ranging from survey data to (large) administrative data.
In the first stage of the estimation, standard estimation techniques can be used to obtain reduced-form estimates.
These estimates can then be used to obtain minimum distance estimates of the structural parameters of our model.
The estimates are particularly informative on the potential size of policies that aim to diminish moral hazard problems — for instance, the use of DI experience-rating systems.
We find that the average fraction of hidden unemployment in DI inflow in 1994–2003 equals about 11 per cent.
This corresponds to 2.6 per cent of all layoffs, including those through the ‘official’ UI scheme.
We find this result to be robust to our choice of exclusion restrictions.
More specifically, using wage distribution quartiles on the one hand, and sectoral business cycle indicators on the other hand, we obtain similar estimates for the size of hidden unemployment.
Our estimates suggest that most of the correlation that is observed between the UI and DI inflow rates can be explained by hidden unemployment in DI, and not by natural correlation that is exogenous to the firm.
For the period of investigation, we find that the hidden component in DI inflow has decreased substantially, from 38 per cent in 1994 to 2–4 per cent from 2000 onwards.
This means that, with constant substitution effects, the DI inflow rate would have been substantially higher until 1999.
Moreover, the decreases in DI inflow from 2000 onwards cannot be explained by a lower inflow of dismissals.
Instead, it may well have been that preventative measures by employers, in particular the experience-rating plan that started in 1998, have lowered the DI inflow rate substantially.
The estimation method we propose in this paper offers interesting avenues for further research.
One way to extend the model is by also addressing substitution between DI inflow and (early) retirement schemes.
Taking this into account — as suggested by Kerkhofs et al.
(1999 ) — would probably imply a higher share of false claimants of DI benefits.
Similarly, substitution effects can be modelled between the inflow rate into the partial disability scheme and into the full disability scheme.
In Section 4.2 we have directly presented the reduced-form specification for the observed DI and UI inflow rates.
These reduced-form specifications can however be explicitly derived from a structural econometric specification that includes the hidden unemployment parameter λ.
For notational convenience, we derive the structural model parameters in a linear model context.
This derivation can be readily extended to the bivariate Tobit version that is estimated in this paper.
In this case, the so-called ‘ABC formula’ is mostly used to determine the amount of severance pay.
This means that the reference pay increases with worker tenure, the current wage earnings, and the extent to which the employer and/or worker can be blamed for the dismissal.
We also estimated the model for separate sectors.
We find hidden unemployment to be the highest in the hotel and catering industry (7 per cent of all dismissals).
We also find the fraction of dismissals directed to the DI scheme (λ) to be relatively high for the financial sector, but the number of dismissals is relatively low as well, resulting in a low share of DI inflow that can be classified as hidden unemployment.
More generally, low sectoral UI inflow rates coincide with a high fraction of hidden unemployment.
Note that we have investigated whether the change in the hidden unemployment fraction correlates with the business cycle (measured as the change in GDP growth), and find a negative but insignificant correlation coefficient.

Ministry of Social Affairs (2005) ‘Ontslagstatistiek: Jaarraportage 2004.
Report, Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment, Directorate of Labour Relations, The Hague.
In tackling the economic crisis in Europe, government and social partner responses, in the form of collective bargaining between unions and employer associations, have been multifaceted and included a wide range of policy measures.
Leaving aside governmental recovery pacts, and focusing on social partners’ responses to protect and promote employment and to safeguard workers’ purchasing power, two major observations can be made: First, statutory, i.e.
law-based, provisions for short-time working and partial unemployment (as in Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, Slovenia, Poland and Hungary) have served as a buffer to mitigate negative employment effects resulting from the contraction of output.
Such short-time working or partial unemployment schemes aim at maintaining employment through temporary working time reductions and at protecting wages by fully or partly compensating workers, by the provision of wage subsidies, for losses in income resulting from a reduction in hours worked.
Insofar as they contribute to companies’ goals of increasing organisational and working-time flexibility, protect human capital and company-specific skills by avoiding redundancies and – at the same time – guarantee the social security entitlements and social welfare rights of employees as well as maintaining their purchasing power, short-time working arrangements have been widely welcomed by both unions and employers’ associations.
Second, the implementation of statutory short-time working provisions is carried out through collective bargaining at the national or sectoral and – in particular – at the company level.
In countries such as Austria, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands, provisions on the implementation of short-time working schemes have been established in a number of sectoral collective agreements.
In other countries, mostly in the central and eastern European countries (i.e.
Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovenia) where statutory short-time working schemes have been introduced (or, as in the Netherlands, re-introduced) as a response to the crisis, law-based provisions are implemented almost exclusively at the enterprise level.
As a consequence, the role of company-level social partners in finding tailor-made responses to deal with the decline in industrial orders has increased.
Such ‘negotiated’ responses by social partners via collective bargaining differ considerably with regard to negotiation processes, their outcome, and the instruments and measures included in such ‘crisis-related’ collective agreements (Glassner and Keune 2010).
Four factors account for the ‘character’ of a negotiated response made against the particular background of the crisis.
First, the national system of industrial relations strongly determines the balance of power between organised labour and business.
Inclusive multi-level bargaining systems allow for the conclusion of ‘higher-level’ agreements that set the framework for bargaining units at the company level.
Thus, the bargaining process is highly coordinated, and basic standards are guaranteed and implemented in a flexible and decentralised way that allows appropriate responses to the specific requirements of the firm.
Secondly, the deteriorating economic situation of companies (or sectors) sets limits on the negotiating leverage and tends to force unions and employee representatives into a defensive position.
Thirdly, the role of the state is decisive in providing a supportive legal-institutional framework (as in the form of short-time arrangements) and in promoting collective bargaining as an instrument to deal with the crisis.
And fourthly, although institutional and economic conditions determine the room for manœuvre of bargaining actors, the outcome of the collective agreement is strongly shaped by their strategies and their capacity to find innovative solutions and arrive at a ‘balanced’ compromise.
With regard to the content of collective agreements concluded in response to the crisis, the flexible reduction of working time has been the most important instrument in dealing with the temporary suspension of business activity.
In countries where arrangements for short-time working already existed or have been introduced, losses in income borne by workers have been limited.
However, the extent of compensation differs considerably between countries and sectors.
In some countries, social partners – in particular in the metal sector – agreed on top-ups to statutory minimum short-time working allowances or – as in Germany – introduced even more flexible procedures to implement working time reductions in the company.
Furthermore, it is mostly workers in the manufacturing industries, in particular the metal, automotive, chemical and ICT sectors, that are covered by short-time working and partial unemployment schemes, service sector workers having been included in such measures to a lesser extent.
Another important issue addressed in collective agreements is the flexibilisation of wage-setting.
In a number of companies, mostly in the automotive sector, in electro-technics and engineering, and in particular in Germany and the Nordic countries, collective agreements include opening clauses that allow for phased wage increases that may be suspended should the company face temporary economic difficulties.
Similarly, training and skill enhancement has been an important issue, in particular in relation to the flexible reduction of working time.
In a number of countries short-time working arrangements include incentives (such as exemptions from income tax and/or social security contributions as in Germany, Slovenia and Romania) for employers and employees to offer/participate in training programmes.
When it comes to assessing the impact of the economic crisis on industrial relations, two questions arise.
First, have governments’ and social partners’ responses given rise to a trend towards ‘decentralisation’ of collective bargaining?
In general industrial relations systems have proved rather stable and sufficiently flexible to respond to the current economic conditions.
This is particularly true in those countries where bargaining coordination is centralised at the national and/or sectoral level.
In countries where collective bargaining is widely decentralised with the enterprise as the predominant level – as in the majority of the central and eastern European countries and in the United Kingdom – the conditions for enabling social partners to arrive at negotiated responses have been less favourable.
So far, only in Ireland does it appear that a decentralisation of collective bargaining may be on the way, as a result of a lack of state support and the threat of the largest employers’ association to withdraw from collective bargaining.
Secondly, has the increased use of opening clauses opened the door for an undercutting of norms set in higher-level collective agreements?
The large majority of agreements, in particular in Germany (a country often referred to in relation to the danger of ‘hardship clauses’), is a result of a rather balanced exchange of interest, albeit with wage restraint as a central feature.
Wage concessions are often made in return for employment guarantees or the extension of employee participation rights.
The downside of the social partners’ priority of safeguarding jobs is a further deceleration of wage dynamics that is particularly felt by employees working in companies strongly affected by the crisis and where resources to compensate for income losses due to short-time work are limited.
In general, however, social partners have played a decisive role in drafting and adopting a wide range of measures aimed at increasing companies’ internal flexibility, limiting labour cost growth, maintaining employment, and improving skill levels, and in this way they contribute to creating the preconditions for sustainable recovery.
For unions, meanwhile, it is vital to ensure that deviations from collectively set standards are in line with higher-level agreements and that they are temporary in nature.
Equally important is the fight against wage restraint – in Germany gross wages in 2009 decreased (for the first time in the post-war period) by 0.4% – and the re-enforcement of a productivity-orientated wage policy.
Unions should intensify the coordination of collective bargaining policies across borders in order to counter the pressure on wages and working conditions that is expected to continue even once the output crisis has been overcome.
The Equal Pay Act (part of the Fair Labor Standards Act) prohibits wage discrimination by employers and labor organizations based solely on sex.
(d) Prohibition of sex discrimination (1) No employer having employees subject to any provisions of this section shall discriminate, within any establishment in which such employees are employed, between employees on the basis of sex by paying wages to employees in such establishment at a rate less than the rate at which he pays wages to employees of the opposite sex in such establishment for equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions, except where such payment is made pursuant to (i) a seniority system; (ii) a merit system; (iii) a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production; or (iv) a differential based on any other factor other than sex: Provided, That an employer who is paying a wage rate differential in violation of this subsection shall not, in order to comply with the provisions of this subsection, reduce the wage rate of any employee.
(2) No labor organization, or its agents, representing employees of an employer having employees subject to any provisions of this section shall cause or attempt to cause such an employer to discriminate against an employee in violation of paragraph (1) of this subsection.
(3) For purposes of administration and enforcement, any amounts owing to any employee which have been withheld in violation of this subsection shall be deemed to be unpaid minimum wages or unpaid overtime compensation under this chapter.
(4) As used in this subsection, the term ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œlabor organizationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬?
means any organization of any kind, or any agency or employee representation committee or plan, in which employees participate and which exists for the purpose, in whole or in part, of dealing with employers concerning grievances, labor disputes, wages, rates of pay, hours of employment, or conditions of work.
Joblessness can hit individual job-seekers hard.
Lacking a job often means lacking social contact with fellow employees, a purpose for many hours of the day, and of course, the ability to pay bills and to purchase both necessities and luxuries.
This last is especially serious for those with family obligations, debts, and/or medical costs, especially in a country such as the U.S., where the availability of health insurance is often linked to holding a job.
Dr. M. Harvey Brenner, among others, has shown that increasing unemployment raises the crime rate, the suicide rate, and encourages bad health .
[1] (http://ashleymac.econ.vt.edu/ashley/3204/brenner.pdf) Because unemployment insurance in the U.S. typically does not even replace 50 percent of the income one received on the job (and one cannot receive it forever), the unemployed often end up tapping welfare programs such as Food Stamps — or accumulating debt , both formal debt to banks and informal debt to friends and relatives.
Some hold that many of the low-income jobs (such as McJobs ) aren't really a better option than unemployment with a welfare state (with its unemployment insurance benefits).
But since it is difficult or impossible to get unemployment insurance benefits without having worked in the past, these jobs and unemployment are more complementary than they are substitutes.
Unemployment insurance keeps an available supply of workers for the McJobs, while the employers' choice of management techniques (low wages and benefits, few chances for advancement) is made with the existence of unemployment insurance in mind.
This combination promotes the existence of one kind of unemployment, frictional unemployment .
Another cost for the unemployed is that the combination of unemployment, lack of financial resources, and social responsibilities may push unemployed workers to take jobs that do not fit their skills or allow them to use their talents.
That is, unemployment can cause underemployment (definition 1).
This is one of the economic arguments in favor of having unemployment insurance .
Under both ancient and modern systems of slave-labor, slave-owners never let their property be unemployed for long.
(If anything, they would sell the unneeded laborer.
) Planned economies (often called " communist countries ") such as the old Soviet Union or today's Cuba typically provide occupation for everyone, using substantial overstaffing if necessary.
(This is called "hidden unemployment," which is sometimes seen as a kind of underemployment , definition 3.
) Workers' cooperatives — such as those producing plywood in the U.S. Pacific Northwest — do not let their members become unemployed unless the co-op itself goes bankrupt.
Most developed countries have aids for the unemployed as part of the welfare state .
These unemployment benefits include unemployment insurance , welfare , and subsidies to aid in retraining.
To calculate the unemployment insurance benefits you might receive in the United States, see the useful page at the Economic Policy Institute (http://www.epinet.org/content.cfm/datazone_uicalc_index).
Of course, unemployment insurance and similar programs have replaced other systems (support from community and churches, home gardening and other production) which played a similar role in the past.
The usual German workweek these days is 38.5 hours, and many employers shut up shop early on Friday afternoons.
The law requires 18 working days of vacation annually, but some companies give much more than that, sometimes as much as 30 working days.
Unpaid leave is also permitted under certain circumstances.
German law is very generous when it comes to maternity and paternity leave.
Mothers are allowed six weeks leave at full pay prior to the child's birth and eight weeks at full pay afterward.
In the case of a multiple birth, 12 weeks paid leave is allowed.
The mother or father is then allowed up to three years of unpaid leave to stay at home with the child.
Recently, the German government initiated a program that allows direct subsidies to new parents ( Elterngeld ).
Let's say that you have a critical skill, are a member of the family of a person with a critical skill or come from another European Union country.
The chances are you can seek work in Germany.
If you are none of the above, you may have problems.
( See the separate article on residence and work permits.
)
A third option is the Labor Office (Arbeitsamt).
It has extensive listings of vacancies, which you can examine without charge even if you have no work permit.
It is sometimes possible for an American with a tourist passport to find a job with the U.S. military forces in Germany, though the prospects aren't terribly bright.
Both local nationals and family members of military people have priority over tourists.
Check with the Civilian Personnel Office that is located in just about any community with a substantial U.S. military presence.
If you find such a job you can take it without having a work permit.
The right to strike is a basic component of any style of management and Manfred Davidmann defines it, giving its source and authority.
He looks at the extent to which people are allowed to strike, and at the extent to which they are able to strike, and what this indicates.
Of interest is his description of Britain's labour relations struggle in the seventies.
This brings in the right to strike, unofficial strikes, role of shop stewards, economic damage resulting from introducing such labour relations legislation and the extent to which this was known in advance.
When a very senior civil servant retired to his country cottage, he caused a stir in the village.
Every morning one of the local boys would call and disappear for a minute or so into his cottage.
They persuaded the boy to reveal what was going on: "I am paid to knock on his bedroom door and shout a few words and then he shouts a few words".
He finally told them what these words were.
He said: "I shouts 'The Secretary of State wishes to see you', and he shouts back 'To hell with the Secretary of State'.
"
To them it appears as if people do not want to work, as if conditions have to be created which force the working population to do as told, by depressing their standard of living <1> and the quality of their lives so that they become more dependent on the employer.
However, enterprises organised on authoritarian lines have many problems.
Orders are passed down and mistakes readily result in critical appraisal and dismissal.
Hence people avoid making decisions so that matters to be decided are either passed up for the decisions to be made at a higher level, or decisions are made by committees as it is more difficult to dismiss all the members of a committee for jointly making a wrong decision.
There are likely to be many such committees.
People survive by becoming expert at passing the buck.
Empire building takes place, this being one way of increasing job security.
Blame is passed to someone else, empires are built at someone else's expense; people work against each other and we see conflict instead of co-operation.
Senior management tends to be overworked, staff turnover tends to be high and workers restrict effort.
Employees participate when they agree to allow themselves to be organised by an employer, and organisation which is based on consent of those being organised is participative.
In a participative organisation people accept responsibility for work to be done, accept that it is their job to carry out a part of the company's activities and that they will be held accountable for the quality of their work.
The manager's job is to back his subordinate by removing obstacles from the subordinate's path, the subordinate asking for such assistance as the need arises.
The manager co-ordinates the work of the group which he manages with that of the higher group in which he is a subordinate.
As work may be a source of satisfaction or of frustration, dependent on controllable conditions, the extent to which subordinates derive satisfaction from their work also depends on their own manager's and on the organisation's general style of management.
People who derive satisfaction from their work will like doing it and do it to the best of their ability; if work is a source of frustration, they will restrict effort and the work is likely to be done badly.
Authority is clearly centred at the top and strikes are illegal.
This places Russia straight on the line marked 'A' (see Figure 6a).
The right to strike is not recognised in the Soviet Union.
It appears {7} that co-operation with management is enforced and that the 'collective contract' between the administration and the workers does not necessarily offer real job security.
Rewards include prizes such as public commendation, certificates of merit, bonuses or gifts of value.
Slack workers may be reprimanded, demoted to lower paid work for a period of up to three months, or sacked.
There was a deep reluctance for workers to take responsibility for any initiatives.
It seems that fairly recently a group of thirty-eight Soviet workers signed a petition against repression and oppression in the field of work.
They apparently brought the document to the attention of the Soviet authorities.
However, Trade Unions in Russia appear to serve the employer (state) rather than the workforce and the attempt to set up a free (unofficial) trade union for representation of the actual workforce has been countered by repression.
The considerable social upheaval and internal terrorist activities (by which I mean the use of vicious and brutal treatment of civilian population for the sake of 'political' ends) may be related to the country's form of government or to the desire for self-government in certain parts of the country but they do not seem to be related to the right to strike.
The United States is a democratic country and it is more difficult to determine to what extent authority is centred at the top and to what extent it is balanced by the authority of the working population exercising their power through the withdrawal of their labour.
The Taft-Hartly Act limits the right to strike, seemingly shifting responsibility for declaring a strike from the factory floor to the union head office.
A cooling-off period may be ordered which delays the beginning of a strike by some months, in this way giving management and workers another chance to negotiate an agreement before engaging in open confrontation, giving both sides another chance to avoid large scale national economic damage which could otherwise arise.
The relative position of one country with respect to another on the scale seems fairly clear.
The right to strike exists and is openly used but the right to strike is limited.
Ownership is in private hands rather than in the hands of the state as in Russia and so we place the USA a good bit further towards the participative style of management, roughly just over half of the way along the scale towards participative management, and this is illustrated by Figure 6d.
On the whole, Australia is not far away from the United States as regards the right to strike.
However, in Australia strikes are illegal since arbitration is compulsory.
This places Australia close to the USA but also closer to the authoritarian style of management and this is shown by Figure 6d.
Before the Act there was no legal limitation to the right to strike but ownership was private so that the UK occupied roughly position 1 on the scale (see Figure 6e).
This then is the central, relevant and utterly important issue at the root of the confrontation.
The Industrial Relations Act and any similar legislation takes away the right to strike from the working population and gives it to the union establishment, takes away from them the ability to decide their own course of action, to agree voluntarily to work for the employer or to decide when to withdraw their labour, takes away from the working population the ability to make their voice heard, the power to express their opinion, the power to influence events, to negotiate in their own interest.
The Industrial Relations Act took away power from the ordinary working people and gave it to a few people at the top of the union establishment.
It replaced upward flowing authority (from the people) by downward flowing authority (from the top).
It removed and destroyed a basic freedom by taking the power to withdraw their labour away from the workforce.
It did not just limit the right to strike, it took it away from the workforce and together with the corresponding authority and power gave it to the few people at the top, to the establishment.
The result of the ensuing confrontation and struggle was that the Industrial Relations Act was repealed and other legislation took its place.
This brought back the right to strike but the 'closed-shop' provisions compelled the worker to belong to the union if he wished to work.
It gave the union and thus its establishment the power to decide who should work and who should not.
The changes would thus seem to have been aimed at increasing the power of the establishment rather than that of the workforce and its elected representatives.
The material point is not whether it is a left wing or right wing dictatorship but whether and to what extent it is a dictatorship.
What matters is whether management is authoritarian or participative.
That is, what matters is whether the people are free or whether they are oppressed, whether they have the right to strike and whether they can exercise this right.
There was no right to strike and this placed Yugoslavia on the scale somewhere between the United States of America and where the United Kingdom used to be, shown by the first Yugoslav position on the scale.
Some years ago strikes were made legal and Yugoslavia moved even further towards participative management, shown by a move from position 1 to position 2 on the scale (see Figure 6f).
Not only are people able to withdraw their labour, but in addition they exercise a great deal of control over their own working conditions and over the future of the enterprise.
If they strike, then presumably they strike against their own management, backing the policy-making board they have elected or perhaps even striking against the policy set by this policy-making board.
The right to strike is there, the workers have that power at least in principle.
It is possible that they may in fact be unable to freely withdraw their labour, that the right to strike is restricted in some way.
In Israel the same Labour government and establishment had until 1977 been in control for just under thirty years.
The government is a very large employer, there is a very considerable private sector but there is also a very large trade union owned sector which contains some of the largest companies in the country.
By 1973 it had become apparent that power was being concentrated in relatively few people and that even the trade union organisation had become more authoritarian.
There was a strong feeling that the central trade union federation (Histadrut) does not represent the workforce as it should.
'Unofficial strikes result {10} from such neglect, drawing attention to local unresolved grievances.
If there are too many unofficial strikes then trade union officials have to be made responsible for properly taking up their members' grievances with management and need to be replaced if they do not do so.
Instead, the government passed a law restricting the right to strike.
Unofficial strikes are out but the Histadrut can call strikes.
Local grievances are bottled up, resentment increases, the conflict becomes more severe.
'
'Introducing such legislation generally results in fewer but bigger strikes which do far more damage to the economy than before.
So what such a law does is to silence effective protest against the trade union establishment and to increase the power of the trade union leaders to direct and control their members.
The free man can withdraw his labour as he pleases so that a basic freedom has been restricted.
'
The Israeli labour law applies to essential or government controlled enterprises.
It was introduced at about the same time as the British Industrial Relations Act and amounts to a move towards a more authoritarian style of management, as shown by position 1 in Figure 6g.
This is open and direct confrontation between the management, that is the socialist 'Labour' party, and the workers.
Management is attempting to compel the men to work whether they like it or not by using as a weapon against the men the labour legislation I have already mentioned.
Management is here encouraging and promoting strife and conflict instead of co-operation and teamwork.
The men were at that time apparently 'working to rule' and apparently there are no labour laws which can be used against them.
Even if the Histadrut had been afraid of legal consequences, they need not have actively opposed the men by withdrawing trade union protection.
The secretary-general of the Histadrut is reported to have said that their decision to withdraw trade union protection was mainly influenced by two inter-related considerations:
To deter workers in essential services from setting their working conditions themselves.
There was not a 'labour dispute'.
The men seem to have worked to rule which apparently and probably was not a 'strike' in the legal sense of the labour law referred to earlier on.
The men's committee now had it from both the Histadrut and from the government.
The Histadrut told them also to faithfully follow their labour contract while the government (management) told them that also they must obey the Histadrut.
In other words they had been locked out by their employer and had been opposed by their trade union.
What took place was that management and owners (the government) and the central trade union federation co-operated with each other to squash an 'unofficial' dispute.
They did so in an attempt to enforce the decisions of the central union establishment over those of the locally elected representatives and the representative works committees, to enforce the decisions of the central establishment over that of the locally elected representatives.
The way in which owners (government), management and Histadrut (central trade union federation) co-operated with each other in my opinion clearly proves this point.
One fails to see how this confrontation in which the government, the management and the central trade union federation opposed and crushed a small section of the working force could contribute to anything but future dissatisfaction, frustration and industrial unrest throughout the country.
Since then Israel has had a continuous sequence of conflict, confrontation and strikes which can be compared to the intense internal struggle which took place in the United Kingdom after the passing of the Industrial Relations Act, in both cases the direct result of moving from position 1 to position 2 (Figure 6g), of moving towards a more authoritarian style of management.
About three months later there were reports from Bonn that dockers and railway workers in Shanghai, the world's most densely populated city, had gone on strike in the last few months for higher wages and better working conditions.
It seems that four strikes closed the main dockyards and railway stations.
It seems that radicals opposed the eight-grade wage scale endorsed by the constitution and demanded immediate moves toward an egalitarian wage.
Many older workers, however, were demanding "more co-operation" from the higher-paid cadres - which is a roundabout Chinese way of demanding higher wages and better working conditions {15}.
About one-third of the employed labour force are members of trade unions, distributed through something like 60,000 unions, based mostly on enterprises.
Such enterprise unions negotiate primarily at the factory, site or enterprise level, although there are some negotiations between national trade union federations on the one hand and employers' associations on the other.
Roughly three-quarters of the trade union membership are in the private sector and exercise the right to free collective bargaining.
Hence Japan is fairly authoritarian in its style of management.
There is little or no power sharing.
People have the right to strike but striking is limited by the Japanese equivalent of the Western fear of the sack, by pressure to conform.
Hence I put Japan close to the UK but consider it to be somewhat more authoritarian (see Figure 6i).
On this basis Spain would seem to be pulling itself up and one would expect both Israel and Britain to be losing out.
But Yugoslavia, which we considered to be one of the most powersharing countries, has a lower standard than much more authoritarian countries.
It could be that we have rated Yugoslavia too highly, that freedom is much more restricted than we thought, that people in Yugoslavia may have the right to strike but are unable to do so.
Further, Yugoslavia started at a much lower level but is catching up and has still some considerable way to go.
These considerations would seem to explain Yugoslavia's apparently anomalous position.
Figure 11 is an example of what has been done.
Here are determinations showing the change in the style of management of a large organisation at level 'A' over a period of about five years.
The measurements were taken at regular intervals and made at two different levels of management.
It took about two years for the results of the particular approach adopted to show but the gains to the organisation are seen to be enormous.
During the later stages the work was continued at the more senior levels and further improvement is seen to have resulted.

Women'S Bureau was officially organized within the Department of Labor in 1920 to investigate and report on the conditions of working women.
Its direct antecedent was the Women-in-Industry Service that had been established in 1918 to advise the Department on wartime labor standards for working women.
As a bureau inside the federal government, the Women's Bureau does not initiate legislation nor does it have any oversight or enforcement capabilities.
Its charge is to formulate standards and policies to promote the welfare of wage-earning women, improve their working conditions, increase their efficiency, and advance their opportunities for profitable employment.
Mary Anderson, a shoeworker and organizer for the Women's Trade Union League in Chicago, was the first head of the Bureau, a position she held until 1944.
As a government office, the Women's Bureau became the official clearinghouse for collecting statistics on working women.
In this capacity it performed the work done previously by voluntary, non-government groups such as the National Consumers' League (NCL).
From its inception, the Bureau worked closely with the National Women's Trade Union League (NWTUL) to promote equal pay, minimum wage, and maximum-hours legislation; and worked toward eliminating night work and employment in dangerous industries.
For decades, the Bureau also led an informal women's coalition that included the NCL, NWTUL, YWCA, the National Councils of Jewish, Catholic, and Negro Women, the League of Women Voters, the American Association of University Women, and women's affiliates in the AFL and CIO.
Working together as a coalition, these women's organizations made considerable progress during the New Deal era in bettering conditions and industrial protections for working women.
The Bureau played a key role in passage of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.
The Bureau has participated in the International Labor Organization.
It led the successful drive to have President Kennedy establish his Commission on the Status of Women in 1961.
Since the 1960s, the Women's Bureau has lobbied for the Equal Pay Act of 1963, created employment initiatives for young and low-income women, and directed attention to the special needs of minority women.
In 1982, the bureau initiated a drive to encourage employer-sponsored day care facilities, and in the 1990s worked for passage of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993.
In 1999, the Bureau established a National Resource and Information Center to make information on issues concerning women more accessible to working women, as well as to their families and employers.
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) was established to enforce provisions of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Title VII forbids discrimination in the workplace based on race, age, handicap , religion, sex, or national origin.
Title VII covers all phases and aspects of employment including but not necessarily restricted to hiring, termination of employment, layoffs, promotions, wages, on-the-job training, and disciplinary action.
Businesses covered by Title VII include employers in the private sector with 15 or more employees, educational institutions, state and local governments, labor unions with 15 or more members, employment agencies, and, under certain circumstances, labor-management committees.
Originally, government-owned corporations, Indian tribes, and federal employees were not covered under the provisions of Title VII; the latter group was protected from discriminatory practices by Executive Order 11478, which was administered and enforced by the U.S. Civil Service Commission.
In 1978, however, federal equal employment functions were transferred to the EEOC.
Title VII—which, along with the rest of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, became operational on July 2, 1965—has since been amended several times over the years.
Key amendments include the Equal Opportunity Act of 1972, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, and the Civil Rights Act of 1991.
The EEOC is also responsible for enforcing the Equal Pay Act of 1963, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (including amendments to Section 501 prohibiting employment discrimination against federal employees with disabilities), and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.
Today, the EEOC provides oversight and coordination of all federal regulations, practices, and policies affecting equal employment opportunity.
The history of federal efforts to create an agency to deal with discrimination goes back to 1941.
Wartime manpower needs and a threat by black civil rights activists to march on Washington, D.C., in support of their demands for improved job opportunities led President Franklin D. Roosevelt to create, by executive order, the Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC).
The FEPC was responsible for ensuring that the federal civil service and those industries essential to the war effort or holding government contracts observed fair employment practices.
The committee operated until 1946.
President Harry S. Truman established the Committee on Government Contract Compliance, which operated only from April 1952 to January 1953.
In September 1953, President Dwight D. Eisenhower established the Committee on Government Contracts; it was replaced in April 1961 with President John F. Kennedy's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity.
In all of these cases, agency authority covered only government employment and employment in private companies doing business directly with the government.
Legislative support for an agency responsible for ending discrimination in private sector employment did not exist until the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 .
Not only has Congress increased the tools available to the EEOC since 1964, it has also expanded the scope of its authority.
In 1979, the EEOC became the lead agency for handing all types of employment discrimination.
Congress gave it enforcement authority for complaints brought under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Equal Pay Act , and Title VII.
Later, Congress expanded the EEOC's jurisdiction through the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Older Workers Benefit Protections Act of 1990, and the Civil Rights Act of 1991 .
The EEOC was created by title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C.A.
§ 2000e-4).
Title VII was amended by the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 (Pub.
L. No.
92-261, Mar.
24, 1972, 86 Stat.
103), the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 (Pub.
L. No.
95-555, Oct. 31, 1978, 92 Stat.
2076 [42 U.S.C.A.
§ 2000e(K)]), and the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (Pub.
L. No.
102-166, Nov. 21, 1991, 105 Stat.
1071). On July 1, 1979, responsibility for enforcement of the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, in private industry as well as state and local governments, was transferred from the Department of Labor to the EEOC.
The Equal Pay Act prohibits gender-based pay differences for substantially equal work requiring equal skill and responsibility; the Age Discrimination Act prohibits employment discrimination against workers or applicants forty years of age or older.
Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) (42 U.S.C.A.
§§ 12101 et seq.
) has been enforced by the EEOC since July 1992.
Title I governs private employers, state and local governments, employment agencies, labor organizations, and joint labor-management committees.
The ADA prohibits employment discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities and requires that employers make reasonable accommodations for these individuals.
Complaints under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 and Equal Pay Act of 1963
The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 and Equal Pay Act of 1963 cover most employees and job applicants in private industry and in the federal, state, and local governments.
An age discrimination charge must be filed with the EEOC within 180 days of the alleged violation, or where the action took place in a state that has an age discrimination law and an authority administering that law, within 300 days of the violation or 30 days after receiving the notice of termination of state proceedings, whichever is earlier.
A lawsuit must be filed within two years of the alleged discriminatory act, or within three years in cases of a willful violation of the law.
A lawsuit under the Equal Pay Act of 1963 may be filed by the EEOC or by the complainant.
There are no prerequisites to bringing a private action under this law.
Wages may be recovered for a period of up to two years prior to the filing of a suit, except in a case of willful violation, for which three years' back pay may be recovered.
The name of the individual filing the complaint may be kept confidential at the administrative level.
Federal employees or job applicants who want to file complaints of job discrimination based on race, color, national origin, sex, religion, age, or physical or mental disability must first consult an equal employment opportunity counselor with the employees' or applicants' agency within 45 days of the alleged discriminatory action.
If the complaint cannot be resolved informally, the person may file a formal complaint within 15 days of receiving a notice of the right to file a complaint.
An accepted complaint is investigated by the agency, and the complainant has a right to a hearing before an EEOC administrative judge before the agency issues its final decision.
An individual who wishes to file a complaint under the Equal Pay Act of 1963 must follow these procedures.
An individual may also elect to file suit under the Equal Pay Act of 1963 without prior resort to the agency or to the EEOC.
In 1975, when backlog reached more than 100,000 charges to be investigated, President Gerald Ford 's full requested budget of $62 million was approved.
A "Backlog Unit" was created in 1978 in Philadelphia to resolve the thousands of federal equal employment complaints inherited from the Civil Service Commission .
^ In addition, The EEOC, the Departments of Labor and Justice, the Civil Service Commission and the Office of Revenue Sharing have adopted Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures to assist employers in complying with federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination.

Two pieces of legislation have been proposed in recent years in attempt to redress the inequity.
The Paycheck Fairness Act, sponsored by Senator Tom Daschle (D-S.D.
) and Representative Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), would increase penalties for equal pay violations and prohibit retaliation against whistle-blowers.
The Fair Pay Act, sponsored in past years by Senator Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), would prohibit wage discrimination based on sex, race, or national origin and require employers to provide equal pay for work of equal value, whether or not jobs are the same.
The Equal Pay Act of 1963 (EPA) (P.L.
No. 88-38, 77 Stat.
56, 59) prohibits employers from discriminating on the basis of gender by compensating workers differently for jobs that require equal skill, effort and responsibility.
In adopting the EPA, an amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, Congress hoped to eliminate wage differentials because they were thought to depress wages and the standard of living, prevent maximum utilization of available labor resources, lead to labor disputes, and constitute an unfair method of competition.
Congress also strove to eliminate stereotypes and misconceptions regarding the value of work performed by women.
Attempts to curb gender-based pay disparities in American industry were not new in 1963.
In fact, during World War II (1939–1945), the War Labor Board declared and administered a policy of "equal pay for women.
" Prior to the passage of the EPA, several presidential administrations had proposed legislation to eliminate gender-based wage discrimination.
They argued that employees doing equal work should be paid equal wages regardless of their gender.
Success finally came on February 14, 1963, when, in a letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Secretary of Labor Willard Wirtz recommended enactment of "equal pay" legislation and submitted a draft bill.
In its deliberations over the act, however, Congress purposely rejected the concept of "equal pay for comparable work" promoted by some advocates of this law, opting instead to adopt an "equal pay for equal work" formula.
"Equal work" means jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort and responsibility and which workers perform under similar working conditions.
Section One of the act provided that those employers covered by the Fair Labor Standards Acts (FLSA) must provide equal pay for equal work regardless of gender, and Section Two of the bill amends the FLSA to state that wage differentials based solely on the gender of the employee are an unfair labor standard.
Section Three lists special circumstances and exemptions to the act.
Section Four, among other things, gives employers bound by collective bargaining agreements a one-year moratorium on enforcement, or until the collective bargaining agreement expired, whichever came first, before compliance was required.
In addition the law exempts wage payments if made pursuant to a seniority system, a merit system, a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production, or one which creates a differential based on any factor other than sex.
For example, differences in the employer's economic benefit received from the work performed can justify a wage differential.
All of the occupational exemptions originally allowed for in the FLSA as a matter of political compromise also apply to the EPA, so workers in agriculture, hotels, motels, restaurants, and laundries, are excluded from the EPA, as are workers in professional, managerial and administrative occupations.

The Equal Pay Act of 1963 is a United States federal law amending the Fair Labor Standards Act , aimed at abolishing wage disparity based on sex.
It was signed into law on June 10, 1963 by John F. Kennedy as part of his New Frontier Program [1] .
In passing the bill , Congress denounces sex discrimination for the following reasons:
No employer having employees subject to any provisions of this section [section 206 of title 29 of the United States Code] shall discriminate, within any establishment in which such employees are employed, between employees on the basis of sex by paying wages to employees in such establishment at a rate less than the rate at which he pays wages to employees of the opposite sex in such establishment for equal work on jobs[,] the performance of which requires equal skill , effort, and responsibility , and which are performed under similar working conditions, except where such payment is made pursuant to (i) a seniority system ; (ii) a merit system ; (iii) a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production; or (iv) a differential based on any other factor other than sex [ .
. .
. ] [2]
In 1963, Congress passed the Equal Pay Act ("EPA" or the "Act") [3] as an amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act [4] , to "prohibit discrimination on account of sex in the payment of wages by employers.
" Congress included within the text of the EPA a clear and concise policy statement and briefly described the problems it was intended to remedy.
The clear statement of congressional intent and policy guiding the EPA’s enactment indicate the Congressional desire to fashion a broad remedial framework to protect employees from wage discrimination on the basis of sex.
The Supreme Court has expressly recognized the view that the EPA must be broadly construed to achieve Congress’ goal of remedying gender discrimination.
Congress passed the EPA out of "concern for the weaker bargaining position of women" to provide a remedy to discriminatory wage structures that reflect "an ancient but outmoded belief that a man, because of his role in society, should be paid more than a woman.
" [5] The EPA protects both men and women.
It also protects administrative, professional and executive employees who are exempt under the Fair Labor Standards Act .
The EPA, Section 206(d)(1) , prohibits "employer[s] ... [from] discriminat[ing] … on the basis of sex by paying wages to employees [...] at a rate less than the rate [paid] to employees of the opposite sex [...] for equal work on jobs [requiring] equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions[.
]" To establish a prima facie case under the EPA, an employee must show that:
the jobs are performed under similar working conditions.
[6]
The EPA provides that the employer may not pay lower wages to employees of one gender than it pays to employees of the other gender employees within the same establishment for equal work at jobs that require equal skill, effort and responsibility, and that are performed under similar working conditions.
Once a plaintiff meets their heavy burden and establishes a prima facie case of gender discrimination under the EPA, then the defendant may only avoid liability by proving the existence of one of four statutory affirmative defenses.
[7] The EPA’s four affirmative defenses allows unequal pay for equal work when the wages are set "pursuant to (i) a seniority system; (ii) a merit system; (iii) a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production; or (iv) ... any other factor other than sex[.
]"
Second, Congress expanded the EPA’s coverage to professionals and other white collar employees.
[13] For the first nine years of the EPA, the requirement of equal pay for equal work did not extend to persons employed in an executive, administrative or professional capacity, or as an outside salesman.
Therefore, the EPA exempted white collar women from the protection of equal pay for equal work.
In 1972, Congress enacted the Educational Amendment of 1972, which amended the FLSA to expand the coverage of the EPA to these employees, by excluding the EPA from the professional workers exemption of the FLSA.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , Women’s salaries vis-à-vis men’s have risen dramatically since the EPA’s enactment, from 62% of men’s earnings in 1970 to 80% in 2004.
[19] Nonetheless, the EPA’s equal pay for equal work goals have not been completely achieved, as demonstrated by the BLS data and Congressional findings within the text of the proposed Paycheck Fairness Act.
[20]
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton first introduced the “Paycheck Fairness Act” on April 20, 2005, which, among other provisions, proposes to amend the EPA’s fourth affirmative defense to permit only bona fide factors other than sex that are job-related or serve a legitimate business interest.
[21] Representative Rosa DeLauro first introduced an identical bill in the House of Representatives on the same day.
[22] On January 29, 2009, President Barack Obama signed into law the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act , which overturned the holding of a Supreme Court case,Ledbetter v. Goodyear, regarding the applicable statute of limitations.
This bill, providing that each gender-unequal paycheck is a new violation of the law, was the first signing of the Obama Presidency and came almost forty-five years after the Equal Pay Act.
However, a 2007 Department of Labor study [23] cautioned against overzealous application of the EPA without closer examination of possible reasons for pay discrepancies: "the raw wage gap continues to be used in misleading ways to advance public policy agendas without fully explaining the reasons behind the gap.
" This study notes, for example, that men as a group earn higher wages in part because men dominate blue collar jobs, which are more likely to require cash payments for overtime work; in contrast, women comprise over half of the salaried white collar management workforce that is often exempted from overtime laws.

It is important to note that the prima facie case of sex discrimination under Title VII is different from the EPA.
For example, Title VII requires intent to discriminate on the basis of sex, and does not require that a plaintiff prove job equality or identify a male comparator.

With certain restrictions, the law gives employers and employees some flexibility to agree to a "different" version of some of the minimum standards under the Employment Standards Act, 2000 (ESA).
This can be done through written agreements between employees and employers.
In some cases, such as where employers and employees enter into agreements for excess hours or overtime averaging, other conditions such as obtaining an approval from the Director of Employment Standards will also have to be met.
average hours of work over a period of two weeks or more for the purpose of determining overtime entitlements
compensate an employee for overtime hours with paid time off rather than with overtime pay
Under the Employment Standards Act, 2000 (ESA), employment is terminated if the employer:
There are a number or exemptions to the termination of employment provisions in the ESA.
Be sure to check Is my job covered?
to make sure you're entitled to written notice of termination or termination pay in lieu of notice under the ESA.
(b) a longer period than described in (a) above, where an employer recalls an employee who is represented by a trade union within the time frames set out in an agreement between the union and the employer.
For example, your employer can't end your employment if any part of the reason for the termination of employment is based on you asking questions about the ESA or exercising a right under the ESA or because you take, or plan to take, a pregnancy, parental, family medical or emergency leave, or because you refused to work in excess of the daily and weekly limits on hours of work.
For more details see Reprisals .
Note: Special rules apply in the case of "mass terminations", where 50 or more employees are terminated at an employer's establishment within a four-week period.
If these circumstances apply to you, look for more information under Resources (below).
What is the difference between termination pay and severance pay?
Termination pay is given in place of the required notice of termination of employment.
Severance pay is paid to a qualified employee who has his or her employment "severed".
It compensates for loss of seniority and job-related benefits and recognizes an employee's years of service.
You only qualify for severance pay when your employment is severed and you:
The facts about equal pay for equal work
The Employment Standards Act, 2000 (ESA) provides that women and men must receive equal pay when:
performed under similar working conditions in the same establishment.
Similar working conditions in the same establishment
Working conditions refer to such things as:
Andy and Kyra both work on a production line.
Kyra packs plastic spoons into small boxes, and Andy packs the small boxes into bigger boxes.
There isn't anything about either of these jobs that requires more skill, effort or responsibility than the other.
If employees haven't been paid equal pay for equal work, employers must raise wages -- not lower them -- to achieve equal pay.
a seniority system.
Under an established seniority system, the time an employee has worked for an employer is credited.
This can be used to justify paying a more senior employee a higher wage than a less experienced employee
Pay equity is equal pay for work of equal value.
The Pay Equity Act is intended to eliminate the wage gap that exists due to the undervaluation of what is typically thought of as "women's work".
Generally speaking, if you are represented by a trade union and are covered by a collective agreement (whether or not you are actually a member of the union), your claim, if it is to be pursued, must be pursued through the grievance procedure contained in the collective agreement between the employer and the trade union.
You will need to speak to your union representative.
Generally speaking, employees represented by a union can't file a claim with the ministry.
If you are represented by a trade union and are covered by a collective agreement (whether or not you are actually a member of the union), your claim, if it is to be pursued, must be pursued through the grievance procedure contained in the collective agreement between the employer and the trade union.
If you have already started a court action against the employer for failure to pay wages or for discrimination in benefit plans, you cannot file a claim with the ministry for the same matter.
In addition, if you have started a court action for wrongful dismissal, you cannot file a claim for termination pay or severance pay under the ESA for the same termination.
Cambodian employers update us on their Child Labour project conducted in cooperation with the ILO >>>>>
Besides being actively involved in the industrial relations and private sectors, CAMFEBA has initiated and implemented certain Corporate Social Responsibility projects including Child Labour Project.
Under the ILO IPEC’s technical and financial support, the project, in its first phase 2006-2008, was aiming to mobilizing employers and their business organizations for the elimination of child labour in the country, focusing on the immediate elimination of its worst forms.
The project was targeting 7 cities and provinces covering bricking sector, rubber plantation sector, fishing sector, salt production sector, child porting sector, and domestic child labour.
Child Labour Focal Persons (CLFPs) representing the target sectors
Code of Conducts for employers against child labour
Employers sensitization on issues, knowledge and information about child labour
As the project has created a platform for employers to address and immediated eliminate the worst forms of child labour and employers globally have played an important role in mobilizing public opinion against child laour, CAMFEBA continues to build on its experiences and working in this area.
Currently CAMFEBA is working with ILO IPEC in order to pursue implementing a new phase child labour project (2009-20012) which is targeting 15 cities and provinces in the country.
We are grateful to on going support by ILO IPEC in engaging CAMFEBA in the elimination of child labour, especially its worst forms.
California's small businesses form the backbone of our state's economy.
They provide the most jobs to our people and with their great flexibility they are able to quickly adapt to the changing demands of the marketplace.
They are both the symbol and culmination of California's great entrepreneurial spirit and they form the basis of our free-market economy.
These businesses and their employees are facing an ever increasing danger.
Their ability to compete in the world economy is being threatened.
The underground economy plagues many of our once vital industries, driving down wages, harshening working conditions and undercutting legitimate businesses to a point where they can no longer fairly compete and can no longer provide well-paying jobs to Californians.
Businesses operating underground have typical profiles such as avoiding licensing requirements, which makes them harder to find and bring into compliance with state and local laws; they pay wages in cash, which allows them to avoid payroll taxes that fund unemployment insurance, disability insurance, and paid family leave; they fail to pay income taxes; they often employ vulnerable workers (newly arrived immigrants), children and the poor to whom they often fail to pay even the minimum wage mandated by state or federal law.
Businesses operating in the underground economy fail to carry workers' compensation insurance, often avoiding minimum occupational safety and health requirements.
By avoiding so many legal requirements, these underground operations carry much lower overhead costs which give them an unfair competitive advantage over legitimate businesses that follow the rules.
In order to help legitimate businesses and California workers combat the underground economy, California needs stronger enforcement of the current labor laws.
For decades California has had some of the strongest labor and workforce safety laws in the country.
To help enforce these labor laws and regulations, the Triple "E" Coalition (Economic and Employment Enforcement Coalition-EEEC) was created as a multi-agency enforcement program consisting of investigators from the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement , Division of Occupational Safety and Health , Employment Development Department , Contractor's State License Board and US Department of Labor .The primary emphasis of the EEEC is to combine the enforcement efforts of the agencies and put as many investigators into the field as possible.
“Workday” is defined in the Industrial Welfare Commission Orders and Labor Code § 500 for the purpose of determining when daily overtime is due.
A workday is a consecutive 24-hour period beginning at the same time each calendar day, but it may begin at any time of day.
The beginning of an employee’s workday need not coincide with the beginning of that employee’s shift, and an employer may establish different workdays for different shifts.
However, once a workday is established it may be changed only if the change is intended to be permanent and the change is not designed to evade overtime obligations.
Daily overtime is due based on the hours worked in any given workday; and the averaging of hours over two or more workdays is not allowed.
Any seven consecutive days, starting with the same calendar day each week beginning at any hour on any day, so long as it is fixed and regularly occurring.
"Workweek" is a fixed and regularly recurring period of 168 hours, seven consecutive 24-hour periods.
An employer may establish different workweeks for different employees, but once an employee's workweek is established, it remains fixed regardless of his or her working schedule.
An employee's workweek may be changed only if the change is intended to be permanent and is not designed to evade the employer's overtime obligation.
Employees covered by a valid collective bargaining agreement if the agreement expressly provides for the wages, hours of work, and working conditions, and if the agreement provides premium wage rates for all overtime hours worked and a regular hourly rate of pay for those employees of not less than 30% more than the state minimum wage.
who work over 40 but not more than 60 hours during the workweek due to a temporary modification in their normal work schedule not required by the employer and arranged at the request of the employee
Any employee who is engaged in work that is primarily intellectual, managerial, or creative, and which requires exercise of discretion and independent judgment, and for which the remuneration is not less than two times the monthly State minimum wage for full time employment
Exempt from overtime provision during any week in which more than half of such employee's working time is devoted to performing the duties of an irrigator.
Employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement if the agreement provides premium wage rates for overtime work and a cash wage rate of at least $1.00 per hour more than the state minimum wage.
No overtime required for a regular schedule of not more than 10 hours per workday within a 40-hour workweek.
For all Orders except Order 16, if the employer requires an employee to work fewer hours than those that are regularly scheduled, the employer must pay the employee overtime at the rate of one and one-half times the employee's regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of eight hours, and, of course, double the employee's regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of 12 hours for the day the employee is required to work the reduced hours.
For Order 16 only, an employee who works longer than eight hours but no more than 10 hours in a workday pursuant to an alternative workweek schedule, must be paid an overtime rate of not less than one and one-half times his or her regular rate of pay for any work in excess of the regularly scheduled hours established by the agreement.
No violation of the daily overtime provisions by an employer covered by Order 5 who institutes a validly adopted alternative workweek schedule that provides for workdays exceeding 10 hours but not more than 12 hours within a 40-hour workweek without the payment of overtime, provided that:
An employee who works beyond 12 hours in a workday must be paid overtime at double the employee's rate of pay for all hours in excess of 12; and
An employee who works in excess of 40 hours in a workweek must be paid overtime at one and one-half times the employee's regular rate of pay for all hours worked over 40 in the workweek.
No daily or weekly overtime required provided employee does not work more than 54 hours and not more than six days in a workweek.
In an emergency, employee may work over 54 hours or more than six days in a workweek and must be paid not less than one and one-half times employee's regular rate of pay for all such excess hours.
No double time required.
No daily overtime.
No weekly overtime required, provided employee does not work more than 40 hours nor more than six days in a workweek.
In an emergency, employee may work over 40 hours or more than six days in a workweek and must be paid not less than one and one-half times employee's regular rate of pay for all such excess hours.
No double time required.
No daily overtime.
No weekly overtime required, provided, employee does not work more than 40 hours nor more than six days in a workweek.
In an emergency, employee may work over 40 hours or more than six days in a workweek and must be paid not less than one and one-half times employee's regular rate of pay for all such excess hours.
No double time required.
who are not otherwise exempt/excluded from the overtime provisions of Order 14 (Agricultural Occupations)
However, no overtime pay is required on the seventh (7th) consecutive day of work in a workweek when the total hours of employment during such workweek do not exceed 30 and the total hours of employment in any one workday thereof do not exceed six.
Live-in employees who are required or permitted to work (i) during the three scheduled off-duty hours that fall within the 12-hour span of work; or (ii) during the 12 consecutive off-duty hours in a workday, must be paid overtime at the rate of one and one-half the employee's regular rate of pay for all such hours worked.
Live in employees who work in excess of five workdays in a workweek must be paid overtime at the rate of one and one-half times the employees regular rate of pay for hours worked up to and including nine hours on the sixth (6th) and seventh (7th) workdays, and two times the employee's regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of nine hours on the sixth (6th) and seventh (7th) workdays.
who are not otherwise exempt/excluded from the overtime provisions of Order 15 (Household Occupations)
No overtime pay is required on the seventh (7th) consecutive day of work in a workweek when the total hours of employment during such workweek do not exceed 30 and the total hours of employment in any one workday thereof do not exceed six.
Providing flexible working hours is another method of helping employees to balance their work and family responsibilities; this can facilitate their time management for other commitments and responsibilities.
This section deals with provisions such as flextime, compressed work weeks and annualized hours.
Although these work arrangements do not ordinarily affect the total number of hours worked (as opposed to provisions such as job sharing, which lead to a reduction of working time), they usually give employees much more control than typical schedules in determining the distribution of time spent at work and time spent on other activities.
This can allow working parents to adjust their schedules to spend more time together or to share child care or elder care duties.
These arrangements therefore have the added advantage of providing more options concerning leisure time and of ensuring, in the case of two-parent families, a more gender-equal distribution of household work.
1
The following graph presents the percentage (%) of major collective agreements containing provisions for flextime.
There has been a gradual increase in the frequency of such clauses: in 1988, 9.8% had flextime clauses; 13.1% in 1993 and 14.3% in 1998.
Thus, flextime has gained prominence during the past decade.
"Flexible" working hours are not always necessarily designed to meet employees’ needs, and may not, in fact, be voluntary.
They may instead be initiated by the employer to improve efficiency and productivity by maximizing operational flexibility.
Although this may be justified on the basis of economic considerations, this type of flexibility may not be particularly conducive to the balancing of work and family obligations.
Often, flexible hours provisions found in collective agreements will reflect a compromise between the interest of employers in optimizing production or service delivery and the needs of employees for flexibility in their work schedules.
This is explicitly recognized in at least one instance.
The Company and the Union recognize both the need to maximize productivity and operating efficiency while recognizing the needs of employees for flexibility in work schedules.
Accordingly, the parties agree to adopt on a trial basis a flexible working hours arrangement which, to be deemed successful, meets the Company’s business and operating needs while maximizing job flexibility as far as is practicable.
When either the Corporation or a group of employees affected consider it desirable to establish a work day, a work week or a work schedule other than those described in this Article, any such changes shall only be made following mutual agreement.
In the event two or more employees pre-select the same start/finish and/or lunch times, and all employee selections cannot be accommodated due to operational requirements, selections will be approved on a seniority basis.
A compressed work week is an arrangement whereby employees work longer shifts in exchange for a reduction in the number of working days in their work cycle (i.e.
on a weekly or biweekly basis).
This can be beneficial for employees in terms of additional days off work (e.g.
longer weekends allowing "mini-vacations") and reduced commuting time, whereas employers can extend their daily operating hours, with less need to resort to overtime.
Compressed work week arrangements may be particularly useful for employees who wish to reduce the number of days per week spent at work, but who can not financially afford to decrease their working hours.
The following graph shows that the presence of compressed time provisions within collective agreements has increased during the past decade.
It should be noted, however, that the data set does not differentiate between employer-initiated and employee-initiated compressed work week schedules.
Therefore, one should exercise caution in interpreting these numbers: considered on their own, they are not necessarily indicative of a trend towards more family-friendly workplaces.
The flexible work week provided clerical employees under this section is intended to allow the work week of such employees to be scheduled as any combination of hours in a four (4) or five (5) day period, Monday to Friday inclusive, to a maximum thirty-two (32) hour work week.
Work schedules will be determined by the department head; but, wherever possible, consideration will be given to employee preferences.
In situations where employees must work simultaneously (i.e.
assembly lines, work teams), it may not be operationally feasible to allow compressed (or other) schedules that are tailored to each individual’s preferences.
However, a few collective agreements provide employees the opportunity to collectively request an alternate schedule.
Of course, this approach may cause some difficulties if a minority of workers is negatively impacted by such a change.
Nonetheless, it still does offer a measure of flexibility for employees overall.
Where 75% of the affected employees in a particular operation or set of operations who have seniority request permission to move to an alternate shift schedule which is acceptable to the Company, such new schedule shall be instituted for a trial period not to exceed 6 months.
ii) the schedule does not result in additional overtime work or payment by virtue of such variation unless the parties otherwise agree;
iv) the hours of work are averaged over the life of the compressed work schedule not to exceed fifty-six (56) calendar days.
Obviously, from the perspective of balancing work and family responsibilities, the most advantageous contract clauses are normally those providing employees with the opportunity to request a compressed work schedule tailored to their personal needs and preferences.
This can often be done within the context of general "flexible work week" provisions; this may be combined with flextime.
It is agreed that the employer can establish work schedules of four (4) ten-hour days.
Flexible working time arrangements can also be provided in the form of "annualized" hours.
These essentially allow employees to choose, within certain boundaries, their days and hours of work, with the proviso that they work a specified number of hours in a year.
This can also be calculated over a shorter averaging period, be it on a monthly, biweekly, or other basis.
Such arrangements combine elements of flextime and compressed work weeks and can have the added advantage of reducing recourse to overtime.
Despite these benefits and the attention that telecommuting has attracted in the media, very few collective agreements contain telework provisions.
Those that exist are mostly concentrated in the public sector and in various Crown corporations, particularly in British Columbia.
The paucity of telework clauses is partly due to the fact that not all occupations are amenable to such an arrangement.
Moreover, employers may be concerned by the initial implementation costs, potential legal liabilities, and difficulties in supervising and appraising the performance of teleworkers.
Unions may disapprove of work-at-home clauses if they perceive them as leading to greater isolation of employees, reduced job security and promotion opportunities, and diminished health and safety protection.
1
The Employer and the Union agree to establish a Joint Committee to discuss the matter of implementing telecommuting on a trial basis.
The Joint Committee shall consist of not more than three (3) representatives of the Employer and three (3) representatives of the Union.
The Committee shall report its findings and any recommendations to the respective bargaining committees for the renewal of the next Collective Agreement.
Where a recommendation is approved by the principals of both parties, it may be implemented prior to the next round of collective bargaining.
Some agreements contain more detailed telework clauses.
These usually specify eligibility and selection criteria and work schedules, together with the terms, conditions and duration of the arrangement.
The parties can also negotiate specific safeguards for employees, to ensure there are no deleterious effects on their workload, employment status and job security.
The Company shall select participants on the basis of their seniority from qualified volunteers who meet the following selection criteria:
The Company agrees to continue reimbursing employees for all work-related expenses, in accordance with its practices and the Collective Agreement, except expenses incurred by employees in travelling to and from their reporting center during the Teleworking period.
(...)
Work hours shall be established in accordance with the Collective Agreement.
Unions often insist on including a number of safeguards for participating employees when negotiating telework agreements.
The most basic requirements are that teleworking must be both voluntary and cancellable.
Additional measures regarding the employment status, work responsibilities and job security of telecommuting employees are also important issues normally discussed by the parties.
While involved in telecommuting, individuals continue to be employees of the Corporation and retain all rights and benefits of the Collective Agreement.
Employee status, salary, benefits and job responsibilities will not change due to participation in telecommuting.
(1) Telework shall not affect the terms and conditions of employment of any employee and the provisions of all collective agreements and relevant legislation continue to apply to an employee who teleworks.
4.
The collective agreement provisions apply to teleworkers subject to this Letter of Understanding.
Hours of work for teleworkers shall be in accordance with the collective agreement.
(4) ensure that the environment of the teleworkplace is such that the employee is able to respect the terms and conditions of employment, as well as relevant collective agreements, legislation, regulations and policies;
Although the provisions examined in this chapter all dealt with the organization of working time, be it in terms of overtime, scheduling, flexible arrangements, work time reduction or telework, they are certainly not the only issues affecting the balancing of work and family responsibilities with respect to time.
Indeed, as will be shown in the following chapters, there are a number of other provisions with a direct or indirect impact on work time, especially those concerning maternity, parental and other leave and vacations.
In Scott & Co v Richardson [2005], the Dependant, Mr Richardson, who worked for a Scottish firm of debt collectors, refused to accept his new terms of employment which required him to visit defaulting debtors during the evenings.
Mr Richardson agreed to work evenings but only if this would continue to attract overtime payments as had previously been the case.
Scott & Co tried for seven months to persuade Mr Richardson to change his mind but he refused, finally issuing an ultimatum that his employer should either accept his position or dismiss him.
They chose to dismiss him.
At first instance, Scott & Co claimed that the change in working conditions was required to bring the company into line with new market practices and to allow them to plan work more cheaply and effectively.
Mr Richardson argued that Scott & Co had failed to prove that there were advantages to the new working arrangements and that the real reason for the changes was to save money in overtime payments.
Mr Richardson succeeded in his claim for unfair dismissal and the Employment Tribunal held that it did not appear that the imposition of the shift system was of such discernible advantage that the only reasonable thing to do was to terminate the employee's contract unless he would agree to the new arrangement.
Following the letter from John Monks, General Secretary of the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) and the European industrial federations on the subject of restructuring operations, the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso,replied that a European framework for restructuring would help to avoid protectionist reactions.
The ETUC has for many years been defending the introduction of an instrument, at European level, to manage transitions and anticipation and it is willing to pursue the debate along those lines.
The European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) and the European Chemical Workers’ Federation (EMCEF) are convinced of the importance of the new chemical laws – REACH and Classification, Labelling, Packaging (CLP) – this is the reason why they are calling on their member organizations to alert employers to their responsibilities through a new campaign.

)
If accrued compensatory time off is not used by an FLSA-nonexempt employee within 26 pay periods or if the FLSA-nonexempt employee transfers to another agency or separates from Federal service before the expiration of the 26 pay period time limit, the employee must be paid for the earned compensatory time off at the overtime rate in effect when earned.
An FLSA-exempt or nonexempt employee must be paid for compensatory time off not used by the end of the 26th pay period after the pay period during which it was earned at the overtime rate in effect when earned if the employee is unable to use the compensatory time off because of separation or placement in a leave without pay status (1) to perform service in the uniformed services or (2) because of an on-the-job injury with entitlement to injury compensation under 5 U.S.C.
chapter 81.
NEW YORK (CNN/Money) - Controversial new rules regarding overtime pay went into effect Monday, with the Bush administration and labor advocates squabbling over how many U.S. workers are affected.
The changes mark the first major overhaul of the federal overtime law in more than 50 years.
The Labor Department says the new rules will strengthen overtime rights for 6.7 million American workers, including 1.3 million low-wage workers who were denied overtime under the old rules.
"Why would anyone want to take overtime pay away from as many as 6 million Americans at a time when they need that money the most?
" Edwards asked.
"I'm skeptical," said employment lawyer Robert Whitman, referring to all the rhetoric.
"It's very hard to generalize about this.
The Labor Department did not come out and say 'the following 50 job titles are automatically exempt or non-exempt (from overtime pay)," said Whitman, a partner in the New York office of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe.
"That's not possible to do.
"
Under the law, there are three primary tests for determining who is eligible ("non-exempt") and who is not ("exempt") from overtime pay.
First up is the "salary-basis" test.
To be exempt from overtime, workers must be paid a set salary, not an hourly wage.
This has long been the rule under federal overtime law.
The new rules don't change this requirement.
The second criteria, called the "salary-level" test, has been amended.
In order to be exempt from overtime, the new rules require that employees earn a minimum salary of $455 a week, or $23,660 a year.
That's triple the prior minimum salary of $155 a week, or $8,060 a year.
The nation's workers and employers face a brand new set of overtime regulations.
CNNfn's Louise Schiavone looks at the new rules and the debate.
White-collar employees who earn more than $100,000 a year are automatically exempt from overtime pay under the new law.
That wasn't the case before, although many high-income workers have been exempt for other reasons besides their income level.
The third test is where the rules get considerably more complicated -- and controversial.
The final prong is called the "duties" test.
It tries to establish eligibility based on the type of work an employee performs every day.
Under federal law, a worker whose job is deemed "administrative," "professional" or "executive" in nature does not qualify for overtime.
The categories themselves won't change.
Instead, the new rules aim to clarify the type of work that qualifies as administrative, professional and executive.
For example, under the executive exemption, a fast-food manager who is involved in key staffing decisions like hiring, firing and promoting may no longer be eligible for overtime pay.
Previously, that fast-food manager had to have the actual power to hire and fire employees in order to be considered exempt.
Overtime rules have long been contentious, with labor unions seeking more time-and-a-half coverage for workers and businesses wanting to restrict non-exempt employees.
While both sides agree that the rules, which have not been revamped since 1949, were outmoded, they have disagreed vehemently about what aspects of the rules need changed.
Every administration since President Jimmy Carter has tried to rewrite overtime rules, but efforts failed because the issue is so politically contentious.
Since the mid-1990s, however, litigation between employers and their workers over time-and-a-half eligibility has exploded.
Many companies like Starbucks, Wal-Mart and Taco Bell have been sued by workers who claim their employers have taken advantage of the outmoded rules to deny them overtime pay.
After a series of multimillion-dollar jury verdicts and settlements, business groups demanded that the Bush Administration rewrite the rules.
J. Craig Shearman, the vice president for government affairs at the National Retail Federation, said retailers, who have been especially hit hard with lawsuits, are pleased with the new rules.
Among other things, he said they simplify overtime classifications by relying less on job titles and more on actual duties.
Labor unions, meanwhile, vow to continue waging battles in court for overtime pay.
And if Democrats retake the White House in November, it's likely that the new rules will be further revised in order to placate workers.
Another factor that could dampen the impact of the new regs is state law.
Some 18 states, including California and Illinois, have separate overtime laws that trump federal law, according to Amy Bess, an employment law partner at Sonnenschein Nath & Rosenthal in Washington, D.C.
With many employers having to make multiple employees redundant, demand for independent legal advisers to sign off large numbers of Compromise Agreements is increasing.
It is in the employer's, employee's and trade union's interest to simplify the process and ensure all employees have access to expert employment law advice in the easiest way possible.
This is particularly so where there are time constraints.
So how can this be done?
If you are an employer making multiple redundancies, or you are a trade union representing a number of people being made redundant, the Compromise Agreement sign-off process can be time consuming and complex.
The more law firms involved, the more cumbersome it can be.
Where multiple redundancies are being made, it is often more efficient for one specialist employment law firm to advise all employees.
This ensures consistency and reduces the time needed to complete the process.
Employers and trade unions can choose a law firm that offers a bulk Compromise Agreement sign-off service.
However, where a single firm is nominated by the union or employer, every employee retains their right to choose their own employment law solicitor if they so wish.
And the employer or trade union must ensure they advise employees of their right to instruct an alternative employment solicitor.
If you are an employer or trade union and you choose to instruct one law firm to act for your employees, this firm will negotiate with your legal team or solicitors if they encounter any problems with the Compromise Agreements.
To make the process as straightforward as possible, it is important to instruct your own specialist employment law solicitors to draft the Compromise Agreements and advise on your proposed enhanced settlement terms.

What is Constructive Dismissal?
While most people will be familiar with the term unfair dismissal, understanding constructive dismissal is less common.
Constructive dismissal occurs if you have been forced to resign from your job.
You might have been constructively dismissed if your employer has acted unreasonably in breach of your contract.
There are many circumstances which can result in constructive dismissal but bullying, excessive workload, demotions & short notice relocation are some of the most common reasons.
Do I have an Unfair Dismissal Case?
If you feel that your employer may have dismissed you unfairly it's important that you make your complaint with three months of leaving the company or you will have no legal comeback.
It's also worth seeking legal advice as the unfair dismissal laws are complex but normally the company is required to go through three stages to dismiss you fairly.
The first stage is they must prepare a written statement explaining why they are considering disciplinary action.
After this they must invite you to a meeting providing you with time to prepare & allow you to take along a colleague or trade union representative.
If after this stage they have decided to dismiss you must have the right to appeal.
If any of these steps haven't been taken you may well have a case for unfair dismissal which you can take to an Employment Tribunal.
Many of us encounter Constructive Unfair Dismissals one time or another.
Before we proceed, let us take a look at what qualifies as a fair dismissal and constructive unfair dismissal.
Unfair Dismissals on the other hand is when your employer ended your employment unfairly.
Under the UK Employment Law; it is considered Unfair when;
Constructive unfair dismissal ( when an employer forces his employee to quit due to his conduct or behavior).
This are just some of the grounds that can be considered as Unfair Dismissal.
If you have experienced or is experiencing this; then I suggest the need to seek employment legal advice from employment law specialist or employment solicitors.
You could also seek employment law advice from the employment tribunal if you are uncertain if your dismissal has grounds to be considered unfair.
They offer a Public enquiry line or helpline for this cases.
There are also a lot of employment law firms in UK and London who specializes in unfair dismissal laws and redundancy law.
In times of employment disputes, It is beneficial that you know your employment rights and the laws that protects this rights.
It is essential that you have a grasp of knowledge of what maybe considered fair dismissal, unfair dismissal laws and redundancy laws.
We have to be equipped with this knowledge to fight any company that exercises unfair dismissals.
Who knows?
After going through this and proving you have received an unfair dismissal, you might end up claiming unfair dismissal compensation.
The forestry sector is in the grips of globalization, while at the same time attempting to make forestry development sustainable.
Both trends are major conditioning factors for livelihoods, employment and working conditions.
In a natural resource-based sector like the forest industry, the links between sustainable development and the International Labour Organization (ILO) goal of decent work come out more clearly than in other sectors.
There is a large measure of congruity between the social dimensions of sustainable development in forestry, as set out in international agreements, and the goal of decent work: opportunities for women and men to obtain productive work in conditions of freedom, equity, security and human dignity.
Forestry livelihoods, employment and working conditions should be discussed in the light of two powerful political and economic developments: globalization and sustainability.
Globalization is clearly gaining momentum in forestry and accelerating the structural changes that have taken place over recent decades.
Falling tariffs and regulation facilitating and encouraging foreign direct investment (FDI) are important driving forces.
Globalization presents advantages and provides new opportunities, but also comprises risks.
The far-reaching and rapid changes caused by globalization have also led to concerns over repercussions on employment levels and forest-based livelihoods, over job security, working conditions and rights at work (ILO, 2001a).
Subsistence employment is likely to decline in most countries, although in Africa it is likely to decline more slowly.
Informal employment is probably growing in most developing countries.
Unfortunately, it is often employment of last resort, providing very low, unstable incomes and poor working conditions.
Decent work is to work productively in conditions of freedom, equity, security and human dignity.
How is forestry doing in this respect?
While there is no single answer to the question (see Poschen, 1997), some deficits remain painfully associated with the sector.
For overviews of the occupational safety and health situation in forestry, see ILO (1991 and 1997) and FAO (1993).
Forestry in general and logging in particular continue to be among the three most dangerous occupations in almost all countries.
Forestry work is also beset by serious health problems related to high physical workloads, exposure to climatic extremes, noise and vibration (see ILO, 1991; 1992 and 1997).
Few workers reach normal retirement age.
The swift change to outsourcing has often meant that measures to ensure acceptable working conditions and safety standards have lagged behind.
Contractors and their employees often experience disadvantages such as short-term contracts, discontinuous employment, greater safety and health hazards, low profitability, long working hours and lack of qualification (in terms of both management and technical skills).
Surveys in Finland (Mäkinen, 1999), Chile (Wenzel and Fecci, 1998) and South Africa (Manyuchi, 2002) show that most have lost out in pay and benefits.
Labour turnover among contractors continues to be high (e.g.
INFOR, 1998 for Chile).
Migrant and clandestine forestry workers have become an issue of increasing concern worldwide.
These workers are often subject to human rights violations and poor working conditions.
They have the most dangerous jobs and they are the least protected in terms of financial resources, education, access to medical care, unionization, workers' compensation, and health and safety.
In Asian countries like Malaysia, clandestine and migrant work is often linked to illegal logging activities.
Working conditions are often appalling.
The use of child labour in industrial logging and charcoal making has been reported in Brazil.
Both child and bonded labour have been reported from states in the Amazon region (ILO, 2001b).
The ILO has also found evidence of forced labour in connection with teak logging in Myanmar and with Dayaks in logging concessions and forest plantations in Indonesia.
In forestry, the institutions of social dialogue and the organizations involved are often weak.
Unionization rates are low and although forest industry associations often exist, they seldom function as employers' organizations, particularly in developing countries.
In all countries, the trend towards outsourcing has complicated organization and the establishment of fora for social dialogue.
Another problem is the absence of women in local networks, associations and trade unions.
Job security will be a major issue for the next two decades, as the transition continues to a workforce predominantly of contractors and the self-employed.
Governments and the private sector should promote professionalism among contractors and discourage bad and illegal practices.
Establishment of contractor associations to provide services and extension should be encouraged.
In recent years more attention has been paid to the relationship between working conditions and productivity (see Strehlke and Johansson, 1996; FAO/ECE/ILO, 1998).
The potential for raising productivity by improving working conditions is, however, often underutilized.
This is largely due to lack of evidence concerning the cost/benefit ratio of such investment.
The benefits are particularly difficult to quantify.
More research could provide much needed evidence to decision-makers.
An example of a hands-on way in which social partners in a number of countries have been building on the relationship between decent work and sustainable development is seen in the codes of forest practices incorporating productivity concerns, as well as protection of the environment and the workforce.
The ILO Code of Practice on Safety and Health in Forestry Work (ILO, 1998) has become a reference document for firms, and national safety regulation and certification schemes such as the Pan-European Certification Scheme and the Forest Stewardship Council.
effective abolition of child labour (ILO Conventions 138 and 182); and
Certification of forest management is perhaps the most widely known and applied measure to promote decent work in forestry.
Social aspects such as working conditions and occupational safety and health, as well as skills requirements, have sometimes been incorporated into such schemes.
Certification should be transparent and certification standards should include a minimum coverage of social aspects with regard to working conditions, sharing in benefits and participation in decision making based on core ILO conventions (Poschen, 2000).
Governments, private forest owners and the forest industry should adopt long-term policies and management plans for forests, as well as strategies for industry development, in order to secure a reliable resource base for industry activity and growth.
These policies, plans and strategies should include adequate provisions and financial resources for social and labour aspects of sector development such as employment, income generation, improvement of working conditions and safety, as well as upgrading of skills.
Workers should participate in making the decisions that will affect them.

Forestry and Wood Industries Committee, Second Session, Geneva.
A proposed EU Directive designed to protect temporary agency workers has been blocked by some Member States for more than five years.
The ETUC and affiliated trade unions are demanding urgent agreement on the new law.
Temporary Agency Work is the most rapidly growing form of atypical work in the EU over the last 20 years.
In Denmark, Italy, Spain and Sweden, the use of temporary agency workers has increased five-fold, and has at least doubled in most other countries, according to the Dublin-based European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions.
By 2000, 2% of workers in the old Member States (EU-15) were on temporary agency contracts.
Each year, some 6 million people are on the agencies’ books at some time or other.
In the new EU Member States, this form of working is also on the increase, although few statistics are yet available.
Slovenia, for example, passed legislation to authorise temporary work agencies in 1998, with new measures to protect workers in 2003.
Since enlargement in May 2004, more opportunities for temporary agency workers from these countries have opened up in the EU-15, making it crucial to establish minimum standards to avoid undercutting of pay and working conditions.
Because temporary staff move frequently from one workplace to another, it is not easy to secure collective representation rights.
However, trade unions have concluded national deals in a number of EU-15 countries, including the Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium, France and Spain.
Compared to all other forms of employment, temporary agency work has the worst record for working conditions, judged on a number of indicators, including repetitive labour, and the supply of information to employees about workplace risks.
Do more shift work and have less time to complete jobs.
It states that a temporary agency worker may not be treated less favourably, in terms of basic working conditions (working time, rest periods, holidays, pay etc), than a permanent member of staff doing a ‘comparable’ job in the same firm.
But in order to accommodate national law and practices, it also allows exceptions to be made where workers have a permanent contract with an agency, or collective agreements provide adequate protection.
In 1995, the Commission launched a process of consultation with the European social partners - employers’ and workers’ representatives - leading to the start of negotiations between the two sides a year later.
The social partners reached agreement in the areas of part-time work and fixed-term contracts, which were formalised as EU Directives in 1997 and 1999 respectively.
In May 2000, the social partner organisations ETUC, UNICE and CEEP launched talks on a temporary work agreement, but after a year of negotiations it became clear that the employers were not going to accept that temporary agency workers’ conditions should be on an equal footing with staff in the user company.
Trade unions throughout the EU have been lobbying hard to get this law approved.
In the UK, for example, trade unionists thought they had achieved a breakthrough in July 2004, when they secured agreement from the government to lift its longstanding objections.
Nannies and other household employees are considered non-exempt workers under the Fair Labor Standards Act.
That means their employer is required to pay overtime for all hours over 40 in a 7-day work week (live-in nannies are generally an exception to this rule, although a few states require live-ins to be paid overtime as well).
Overtime hours must be paid at a rate that is at least 1.5 times the regular rate of pay.
Many families try to side-step overtime by offering a salary.
In their minds, jobs that pay a salary -- instead of hourly -- are legally able to pay a fixed amount of wages regardless of how many hours the employee works.
This is true in most "white-collar," "highly-compensated" professions because workers in these types of jobs are not prone to abuse.
In the case of household workers, however, employers must make sure to properly address overtime pay.
Note about overtime: If the worker and employer agree to a salary based on a schedule that regularly includes more than 40 hours, the family should protect themselves by addressing overtime in an employment agreement that is signed by the employee.
For example: Family and nanny agree to $450 per week based on a 45-hour work week.
The employment agreement should specify that the weekly compensation was calculated based 40 hours at the regular rate of pay $9.47/hr plus 5 hours at the overtime rate of $14.21/hr.
Additionally, it must be stated that any hours over 45 in a work week will be paid at the overtime rate of $14.21.
Overtime issues are particularly dangerous for employers because there is no statute of limitations.
So former employees can file a wage dispute many years after the relationship has terminated.
Back wages plus back taxes, penalties and interest can make this a very expensive mistake.
The good news is a simple employment agreement makes all the worries go away.
Overtime hours are to be calculated both on a daily and on a weekly basis.
The higher of the two numbers is overtime hours worked in the week.
All employees, including those who are paid a weekly, monthly, or annual salary, must be paid overtime pay for overtime hours they work.
A number of industries and occupations are subject to variations in daily and weekly hours worked before overtime is payable.
Overtime must be paid at the rate of at least 1.5 times the employee's regular wage rate.
The sole exception applies where the overtime is accumulated under an overtime agreement.
Employees, who are paid exclusively by incentive pay such as commission, piecework or a similar method, have no established rate of pay.
Therefore, for the purpose of calculating overtime entitlements the wage rate is deemed to be the minimum wage.
If the incentive pay is less than what would have been earned applying the minimum wage, the employer must top up the incentive pay earnings.
If an employee is paid by a combination of salary and incentive pay, and the salary is greater than minimum wage, the salary establishes the hourly rate for the purpose of calculating overtime entitlements.
Some employers and employees agree to replace overtime pay wholly or partly with time off with pay.
This is done through the use of an overtime agreement.
An overtime agreement allows overtime hours to be banked and later taken off with pay, hour for hour, during regular work hours.
There are a number of rules that apply with respect to overtime agreements:
The agreement can be between an employer and a single employee or with a group of employees, or the overtime agreement can be part of a collective agreement.
Overtime hours are calculated the same way under an overtime agreement as it would be if overtime pay is to be paid at time-and-a-half.
The Code requires an overtime agreement to be in writing.
Employers must give employees who are covered by an overtime agreement a copy of the agreement.
Time off must be taken within three months of the end of the pay period in which the overtime was earned.
If time off is not taken, overtime hours must be paid out at time-and-a-half.
Most workers who are paid an hourly wage and work more than 40 hours in a 7-day work week must be paid overtime.
When paying overtime, a business must pay at least one and one-half times the worker’s regular hourly rate.
Yes.
Businesses may make overtime mandatory even if the workers do not want to do so, and even on a day that is normally a scheduled day off.
(Exception: registered nurses and licensed practical nurses.
Get information here on nurses’ overtime rules .
)
Most workers paid by the hour must be paid overtime for working more than 40 hours in a 7-day work week, but some do not.
For a partial list of the types of workers who may not be required to be paid overtime, please go to Jobs Not Paid Overtime .
Washington law allows a worker to request time off at a later time instead of being paid overtime wages in each pay period.
This is sometimes called “comp time” or “exchange time.”
When the employee takes the time off, it must be at the rate of at least an hour and one-half for each overtime hour worked.
In other words, the employee must either be paid overtime wages at time and one-half or be allowed to take an hour and one-half off for each overtime hour worked.
Businesses may choose to pay overtime to workers who work on a holiday, but the law does not require them to do so.

Overtime pay is one of the foundations of the American workplace.
Employees expect to be compensated for their overtime, so California overtime labor laws are designed to prevent California employers from taking advantage of their workers by providing regulations against the following:
Bob works for ABC Software, located in California.
He is paid a fixed salary of $60,000 annually and has worked 4 hours of overtime, 5 days per week for the past 3 years.
If it is determined that Bob is not exempt and is entitled to California overtime pay, his claim may yield an estimated $208,883 from his employer.

Shift work is usually separated into early morning, afternoon and late night shifts.
Allowances for shift work range from an additional 10% to 30% on top of your normal salary for the entire shift.
Many awards and agreements allow for workers to work a set number of days within a seven day period.
Part of these ordinary hours of work may fall on a Saturday or Sunday or late on certain nights.
For instance if you work as a hairdresser or at a restaurant, your normal hours may include weekend or late night work.
If you work a late shift, work on a Saturday or Sunday, or a public holiday you will usually be entitled to additional money or penalty rate.
The amount of the penalty rate will depend on which award or agreement covers your work.
Overtime rates are paid for work completed outside your ordinary hours of work.
For example, your award or agreement may not include weekends and late night work in your ordinary hours of work.
If this is the case and you are required to work at these times, you will usually be entitled to some extra money on top of your usual salary.
This will be paid at the overtime rate detailed in your award or agreement.
In some circumstances, part-time and casual workers may be required to work up to the same hours as a full-time worker before overtime is paid.
It is important to check your award or agreement for the conditions of overtime and penalty rates for your job as these conditions can differ between different types of work.
You may be able to take time off in lieu (instead of receiving penalty or overtime payments) for extra time worked.
Once again, check your award or agreement to see if this applies to you.
For most employees, whether they work full-time, part-time, are students, temporary help agency assignment employees, or casual workers, overtime begins after they have worked 44 hours in a work week.
After that time, they must receive overtime pay.
Overtime pay is 1½ times the employee's regular rate of pay.
(This is often called "time and a half.
")
For example, an employee who has a regular rate of $12.00 an hour will have an overtime rate of $18.00 an hour (12 x 1.5 = 18).
The employee must therefore be paid at a rate of $18.00 an hour for every hour worked in excess of 44 in a week.
Unless a contract of employment or a collective agreement states otherwise, an employee does not earn overtime pay on a daily basis by working more than a set number of hours a day.
Overtime is calculated only:
Many employees have jobs that are exempt from the overtime provisions of the Employment Standards Act, 2000 ( ESA ).
Others work in jobs where the overtime threshold is more than 44 hours in a work week.
(See " Industries and Jobs with ESA Exemptions and/or Special Rules ")
Managers and supervisors do not qualify for overtime if the work they do is managerial or supervisory.
Even if they perform other kinds of tasks that are not managerial or supervisory, they do not get overtime pay if these tasks are performed only on an irregular or exceptional basis.
Some employees have jobs where they are required to do more than one kind of work.
Some of the work might be specifically exempt from overtime pay, while other parts might be covered.
If at least 50 per cent of the hours the employee works are in a job category that is covered, the employee qualifies for overtime pay.
Gerard works for a taxi company both as a cab driver and as a dispatcher in the office.
Working as a cab driver he is exempt from overtime pay, but working in the office as a dispatcher he is not.
During a work week, Gerard worked 26 hours in the office and 24 hours driving a cab, for a total of 50 hours.
This is six hours over the overtime threshold of 44 hours.
Because Gerard spent at least 50 per cent of his working hours that week as a dispatcher (a job category that is covered), he qualifies for six hours of overtime pay.
Agreements for Paid Time Off Instead of Overtime Pay
An employee and an employer can agree in writing that the employee will receive paid time off work instead of overtime pay.
This is sometimes called "banked" time or "time off in lieu.
"
If an employee has agreed to bank overtime hours, he or she must be given 1½ hours of paid time off work for each hour of overtime worked.
Paid time off must be taken within three months of the week in which the overtime was earned or, if the employee agrees in writing, it can be taken within 12 months.
If an employee's job ends before he or she has taken the paid time off, the employee must receive overtime pay.
This must be paid no later than seven days after the date the employment ended or on what would have been the employee's next pay day.
The manner in which overtime pay is calculated varies depending on whether the employee is paid on an hourly basis, on a fixed salary, or has a fluctuating salary.
Overtime pay calculations may also be affected by public holidays.
The following are several examples of how overtime pay is calculated in different cases.
Ravi's regular pay is $12.00 an hour.
His overtime rate (1½ × regular hourly pay) is $18.00 an hour.
This week Ravi worked the following hours:
A fixed salary compensates an employee for all non-overtime hours up to and including 44 hours a week.
After 44 hours, the employee is entitled to overtime pay.
First Sharon's regular (non-overtime) hourly rate of pay is calculated:
Then the amount of overtime she worked is calculated:
50 hours − 44 hours = 6 hours of overtime
Sharon is entitled to $102.24 in overtime pay.
Finally, Sharon's regular salary and overtime pay are added together:
First Ben's regular (non-overtime) hourly rate of pay is calculated:
Next his regular (non-overtime) earnings are calculated.
He is entitled to $11.25 an hour for all hours up to and including 44 hours a week:
Then his hourly overtime rate is calculated:
His overtime rate is $16.88 for every hour in excess of 44 hours.
The amount of overtime Ben worked is calculated:
50 hours − 44 hours = 6 hours of overtime.
Finally, Ben's regular pay and overtime pay are added together:
Calculating Overtime When There is a Public Holiday
Antonio’s regular pay is $12.00 an hour.
Antonio worked overtime on a week with a public holiday, but he did not work on the holiday.
Antonio’s public holiday pay for the Monday is $96.00 (See Public Holidays Pay for information on how to calculate public holiday pay).
This week Antonio worked the following hours:
Since Etsuko received premium pay for working nine hours on the public holiday, these hours are not included when the overtime pay is calculated:
54 hours − 9 hours at premium pay = 45 hours = 1 hour of overtime pay
Since Kathleen agreed not to receive premium pay for the nine hours she worked on the public holiday, these hours are counted when the overtime pay is calculated:
50 hours − 44 hours = 6 hours of overtime
Some employees' wages are not based on the number of hours they work in a week but instead are paid by the number of pieces they complete and/or by commission.
These employees must be paid at least the minimum wage for all the hours they work.
They are also usually entitled to overtime if they work more than 44 hours a week.
Calculating the overtime for piecework or straight commission employees
First the regular (non-overtime) hourly rate of pay is calculated:
Then the hourly overtime rate is calculated:
Their overtime rate is $16.37 for every hour in excess of 44 hours.
Next, the amount of overtime worked is calculated:
48 hours − 44 hours = 4 hours of overtime.
They are each entitled to $65.48 in overtime pay.
Finally, the regular pay and overtime pay are added together:
Calculating the overtime for hourly rate plus commission employees
Justine is paid $15.00 an hour plus commissions.
In one work week she worked 50 hours and was paid $750.00 in hourly wages plus $200.00 in commissions.
Because Justine was paid $15.00 per hour for all hours she worked, including her 6 overtime hours, she has already received $90.00 in respect of her overtime entitlement.
Result: Justine was entitled to $194.34 for overtime pay and was paid $90.00.
Her employer therefore owes her an additional $104.34.
An employer and an employee can agree in writing to average the employee's hours of work over a specified period of two or more weeks for the purposes of calculating overtime pay.
Under such an agreement, an employee would only qualify for overtime pay if the average hours worked per week during the averaging period exceed 44 hours.
For example, if the agreed period for averaging an employee's hours of work is four weeks, the employee is entitled to overtime only after working 176 hours during the four work weeks (44 hours × 4 weeks = 176 hours).
Note that averaging periods cannot overlap one another and must follow one after the other without gaps or breaks.
In addition to having agreements in writing, the employer must also obtain an approval to average hours of work for overtime pay purposes from the Director of Employment Standards.
An approval to average hours of work for overtime pay purposes expires on the date on which the averaging agreement between the employer and employee expires, or on any earlier date specified by the Director in the approval.
The Director of Employment Standards may also unilaterally revoke an approval to average hours of work by providing the employer with reasonable notice.
Employers who would like to make an application for an approval to average hours of work for overtime pay purposes are required to make their application in a form provided by the Ministry of Labour.
The application form is available on the Ministry's website.
For more information, please refer to the Employer's Guide to the Application Process: Excess Hours of Work/Averaging Hours .
An employer who receives an approval to average overtime pay must post a copy of the approval in the workplace where it is likely to come to the attention of the employee(s) identified in the approval and to keep it posted until it expires or is revoked and then remove it.
Myron and his employer agree in writing to average his hours for overtime purposes over a period of two weeks and Myron's employer obtains an approval from the Director of Employment Standards.
Myron works 54 hours the first week and 36 hours the second week.
He earns $14.00 an hour and his overtime rate is $21.00 per hour (1½ × $14.00).
The average number of hours worked per week minus 44 hours equals the average number of overtime hours in each week of the averaging period.
The overtime entitlement in week one and two of the averaging period is calculated by multiplying the average overtime hours per week by his overtime rate for that week.
Connor earns $13.00 an hour in weeks when he is working in the retail department and $20.00 an hour when he is working on the assembly line of his employer's operation.
He and his employer have agreed in writing and the employer has received an approval from the Director of Employment Standards to average his hours over four weeks for the purpose of calculating overtime.
In the first two weeks of the averaging period he is working in the retail department and his overtime rate is $19.50 per hour ($13.00 × 1½).
In the second two weeks of the averaging period he is working on the assembly line and his overtime rate is $30.00 an hour ($20.00 × 1½).
The maximum number of hours an employee can work in a regular work week, before being paid overtime, is 44 hours.
However, since Connor has signed a written agreement and his employer has an approval from the Director to average his hours of work for overtime pay purposes over a four week period he will qualify for overtime pay if his average hours (that is, the average hours per week during the averaging period) exceed 44 hours.
An employee can make an agreement to take time off in lieu of overtime pay or an agreement to average hours of work for overtime pay purposes, however, an employer and an employee cannot agree that the employee will give up his or her right to overtime pay under the ESA .
Agreements such as these are not allowed and the employee is still entitled to overtime pay.
An employer cannot lower an employee’s regular wage to avoid paying time and a half after 44 hours (or another overtime threshold that applies) in a work week.
For example, if Josée’s regular pay is $15.00 an hour, her employer cannot drop her regular rate in a week when overtime was worked to $12.00 an hour and then pay her $18.00 (1½ × $12.00) for overtime hours worked instead of $22.50 (1 ½ × $15.00).

State wage and hour/labor department .
The best way to survive an audit from your state's wage and hour (or employment) department is to comply with the state employment laws in your state.
The best way to comply is to know the law.
Look up the employment laws in your state, as they relate to minimum wages, child labor laws, overtime and overage, rest periods and other terms of employment,.
4.
OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) .
The best way to survive an OSHA inspection is have a fully compliant OSHA program in place, including an OSHA poster and training for employees on hazardous materials/blood borne pathogens (if applicable)/fire and other emergencies.
And, of course, your workplace must be free of hazards.
5.
Federal Wage and Hour (Labor Department) .

Overtime pay is the compensation paid to an employee for hours worked more than 40 hours in a single work week.
Yes, always.
States cannot adopt laws that do not at least meet the federal law minimum overtime pay standards.
Some state laws require overtime pay to be paid when an employee works more than eight hours in a single day and some state laws for overtime pay are more generous to employees than are federal laws.
Who is Eligible to Receive Overtime Pay?
All nonexempt workers are eligible to receive overtime pay, and, in some cases, this includes salaried employees that may also be considered nonexempt.
No.
It is important to understand that “nonexempt” does not necessarily include all hourly wage earners.
An employee is determined to either be nonexempt (eligible) or exempt (not eligible) for overtime pay based on a variety of factors.
Do I have to Pay Salaried Workers Overtime Pay?
Generally, no, but in some cases you may be required to pay overtime to salaried employees (nonexempt salaried employees are usually defined as those working in certain industries, performing certain tasks, and who make a salary under a certain threshold).
In some cases, an employer may pay a “salary” for nonexempt positions to simplify payroll.
However, the employer must still pay the salaried, nonexempt worker for any overtime hours that they work.
How Much is the Overtime Hourly Pay Rate?
Federal law stipulates nonexempt employees eligible for overtime pay be compensated for overtime hours at a rate of one and one-half (1.5) times their regular rate of pay.
Do I have to Pay Employees Overtime Based on Hours Worked?
Yes.
However, employers may pay some employees by piecework or annual salary (in which case any expected overtime hours are “built in” to the compensation package).
But in each case, overtime pay for all nonexempt employees must still be calculated based on the hours eligible employees work per workweek.
Overtime pay must be paid at the same time an employee is paid for regular hours worked in the same 7-day (24 consecutive hours) work week.
In other words, an employer cannot hold back on overtime pay – it must be kept current and paid on the same cycle for regular payroll.
Although some employers voluntarily offer premiums or overtime pay for this, there is no provision in the FLSA that immediately leaps out at you, about your employer specifically requiring you to carry a pager or cell phone during "off-duty" hours.
It's a no-brainer that employers are obligated to pay overtime to eligible employees who've already worked a 40-hour workweek, but must work additional hours because their employers called them to duty from standby.
But, generally, the FLSA does not require employers to issue overtime pay to "on-call" employees just for standing by at home or leaving phone numbers where they can be reached.
However, if your employer imposes additional restraints on your freedom, such that you can't use the time effectively for personal pursuits, Fact Sheet #22 mentions that you might be due compensation.
For a brief interpretation, see the article " When You Have To Be Paid For Not Working " at Nolo.com, an information service offering content about common legal matters.
If your employer makes you attend a training class during or outside of your regular work hours, then the time probably counts as "hours worked".
Your employer will owe you overtime pay, if all hours you worked (including the training class) exceed 40 in the same workweek.
For example, if you've already worked 38 hours and a mandatory training class adds another 4 hours, for a total of 42 in a workweek, then your employer likely owes you 2 hours of overtime pay.
Whether or not your employer would owe you overtime pay for other training scenarios, depends on "if this, then that" factors that are a bit too convoluted to explain here.
Step through the FLSA Hours Worked Advisor to learn about other training scenarios.
True independent contractors (ICs, freelances, consultants) are self-employed, and as such, not entitled to overtime pay under the FLSA.
(But ICs may contractually arrange overtime pay with their clients.
) However, if an employer has misclassified you as an IC, when you're really an employee according to the FLSA guidelines , that's a different matter.
Although there is no direct relationship with the FLSA, the IRS also offers guidelines they call Common-Law Rules , to help you determine whether or not you're misclassified as an IC.
The IRS will even make the determination for you , if you're willing to risk ticking off your employer.
If the IRS determines that you are misclassified, while it's mostly for tax purposes, you might in turn have a valid lawsuit under the FLSA, state labor law or both, to collect back overtime pay and even benefits.
In the meantime, the IRS might nail your employer for back taxes and fines, which could help your case.
But it's a probably a good idea to let an attorney decide whether or not to open the IRS can of worms.
For example, filing a lawsuit under the FLSA or equivalent state law might be the better way to go.
Legally, no.
It's your right to challenge your employer's questionable overtime pay practices.
(But challenge in a reasonable way, to avoid giving your employer a legit, "loophole" excuse to fire you.
) If your employer fires you anyway, you might have a winnable lawsuit for retaliation in violation of Federal labor law or wrongful termination .
See an attorney about that.
To ensure you have a leg to stand on, it might be a good idea to consult with an attorney (or at least your union rep) before you challenge your employer's overtime pay practices.
Overtime lawsuits are occurring more frequently in the U.S. Some workers have filed and won lawsuits alleging that they were misclassified as salaried-exempt employees or independent contractors, to their employers' advantage.
Others have sued and won because a company policy contradicted the definition of a salaried-exempt employee, such as docking pay for tardiness.
(Because salaried-exempt employees might have to work extra hours without overtime pay, employers can't dock their salaries for tardiness.
But excessive tardiness is likely " good cause " for termination under the Employment At Will Doctrine .
) There are many more reasons one might legitimately sue for back overtime pay.
If you prefer, you might be able to bypass the judicial system through arbitration .
Alternately, you may request a hearing with a Department of Labor Administrative Law Judge .
In any case, first see an attorney who specializes in overtime pay matters.
Read the article " New Overtime Law " for a summary of the Federal overtime pay changes that became effective in August, 2004.
These overtime pay FAQs cover the basic rules only.
There are many exceptions, special cases and other rules in both the FLSA and equivalent state labor laws that are not included here.
As mentioned earlier, state laws may differ from the Federal Act .
Consult with an attorney if you think you've been cheated out of overtime pay.

The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) is the federal agency charged with promoting the best interests of wage earners, job searchers, and retirees.
The DOL does this by: “improving their working conditions, advancing their opportunities for profitable employment, protecting their retirement and health care benefits, helping employers find workers, strengthening free collective bargaining, and tracking changes in employment, prices, and other national economic measurements.”
The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), first enacted by the United States Congress in 1938, sets standards for the basic minimum wage and overtime pay.
The FSLA also sets standards for recordkeeping and for child labor.
The FLSA affects most private and public sector employment, including state, local, and federal government.

For covered, nonexempt employees, the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) requires overtime pay (PDF) to be at least one and one-half times an employee's regular rate of pay after 40 hours of work in a workweek.
Some exceptions apply under special circumstances to police and firefighters and to employees of hospitals and nursing homes.
Some states have overtime laws.
In cases where an employee is subject to both the state and federal overtime laws, the employee is entitled to overtime according to the higher standard (i.e., the standard that will provide the higher overtime pay).
The Department of Labor has revised and clarified the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act.
The FairPay site contains helpful fact sheets explaining these changes and also includes the revised regulations and an online training program to make this transition easy for employers and employees.
For non-exempt (hourly) employees, no.
An employer does not have to pay hourly employees for time off on a holiday.
An employer is only required to pay hourly employees for time actually worked.
On the other hand, exempt employees (salaried employees who do not receive overtime), who are given the day off, must be paid their full weekly salary if they work any hours during the week in which the holiday falls.
This requirement for exempt employees did not change under the new federal overtime regulations.
Must paid time off be counted as hours worked in determining whether an employee is entitled to overtime?
No.
If an employer provides paid holidays, it does not have to count the paid hours as hours worked for purposes of determining whether an employee is entitled to overtime compensation.
An employee must actually work 40 hours in a week before he/she is eligible for overtime.
Paid time off (holidays, vacation, sick leave, etc.
) is not considered time worked.
Note, however, that many collective bargaining agreements include additional provisions for determining overtime.
As a restaurant owner, it is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with state and federal employee laws, such as those pertaining to minimum wage, overtime, and tips.
Here is a basic overview of employer responsibilities, which every new restaurant owner should be familiar.
Failure to comply with these rules can result in hefty fines from local, state and federal authorities.
Overtime refers to hours worked beyond the standard 40-hour week.
If an employee works overtime, they get paid time and half.
For example, if a cook who is paid $12.00 an hour works 45 hours, five of those hours will paid at $18.00 an hour.
It is a good idea to limit overtime, otherwise you payroll costs will skyrocket.
Occasionally an employee might offer to work overtime for their regular wage, to get more hours.
Regardless of their wiliness to work for their regular wage, employers must pay overtime.
Alien workers, or immigrants, are another example of where you want to be sure and verify their worker eligibility.
The last thing you need as a new restaurant owner is to be accused of hiring illegal aliens to work for you, simply because you didn’t validate their visa or work permit.

Section 14 bis of the Constitution establishes a number of workers' rights, including dignified and equitable working conditions; limited working hours; paid rest and vacations; fair remuneration; minimum vital and adjustable wage; equal pay for equal work; participation in the profits of enterprises, with control of production and collaboration in the management; protection against arbitrary dismissal; stability of the civil servant; free and democratic labour union organization.
It also guarantees trade union rights to enter into collective bargaining, to resort to conciliation and arbitration, the right to strike, and the protection of union representatives.
This list of workers' rights calls for further development by law, as the wording of the constitutional provision does not allow for direct implementation.
Some of the above rights have been actually implemented by laws or regulations, while others (e.g.
profit sharing and co-determination) have not.
The first labour legislation in Argentina was first adopted in the early decades of the XX th century.
Like many other Latin American countries, the first areas to be regulated, even before 1910, were weekly rest, and work by women and minors.
In 1915 a Law was adopted, on industrial accidents and occupational diseases.
Further legislation addressed issues such as hours of work (1929), and termination of employment (1934).
Paid leave and trade union organization were regulated in the forties, by the then Secretary of Labour, Colonel Perón, and collective bargaining was regulated in the fifties.
As the labour legislation became more sophisticated, and as it was being further enriched by collective agreements and judicial decisions, it became indispensable to have a consolidated text.
This was done in 1974, and took the form of a Law on Contract of Employment (Ley de Contrato de Trabajo, LCT), which underwent a major revision in 1976.
Whereas trade unions were formed in Argentina as early as the XIX th Century, no specific regulation was adopted in this field until 1945, when Decree no.
23852 was issued.
This Decree organized trade unions under an industry-wide and single-union structure.
At the same time, the Secretary (later upgraded to Minister) of Labour was given far-reaching powers in union recognition procedures.
At the union higher level structure, only one Workers' Confederation was recognized, namely the General Confederation of Workers, CGT.
Decree 23852 was amended several times.
Yet the industry-based and single-union structure remains the prevailing pattern in the country.
The Ministry of Labour is still a key stakeholder in union recognition procedures.
Present regulation is laid down in Law no.23551, of 1988.
Collective Labour Disputes are regulated by various texts, the most noteworthy of which is Law 14786, on conciliation and arbitration in industrial disputes, adopted in 1958 (Ley 14786 de conciliacion obligatoria.doc.
)
The right to strike is guaranteed under the constitution, and it is normally granted in all activities, it being understood that a minimum service must be guaranteed where a strike affects an essential service.
In 2000 a law was repealed, which permitted the public authority to submit a labour conflict to compulsory arbitration (as a matter of fact this law had very rarely been invoked).
Collective agreements may also play an important role in labour regulation, particularly because they are legally binding, and usually cover very a wide range of industries or branches of industries.
As a matter of fact, most workers are covered by a collective agreement.
However, their actual impact varies widely from one industry to another, and in most cases apart from fixing wages they are not a meaningful source of labour regulation.
Case law plays a certain role, however limited, in actual labour regulation, to the extent that leading judicial decisions may clarify the actual bearing of labour law provisions.
According to the country's legal system, legal interpretation as laid down through decisions by superior tribunals is mandatory on lower tribunals with respect to similar cases.
Furthermore it should be noted that the Supreme Court is empowered to dismiss the application of any legal rule which it considers not compatible with the Constitution (1) .
Whereas the decision it may take in such a case would not legally repeal such a rule it would, however, be binding on any other individual case where the application of the same rule would be at stake.
This means that the State would actually be obliged to amend the said rule, so that it becomes consistent with the Constitution.
While labour litigation normally does not reach the Supreme Court, in some cases it has, and some rulings by this Court contribute to Argentinean Labour Law (2) .
The web site of the Ministry of Labour publishes the most relevant labour laws: http://www.trabajo.gov.ar/documentacion/legislacion/index.html
The first three months of a contract of employment are considered a probation period, during which the contract may be terminated at any time by either party, provided the contract has been duly registered with the competent authority in charge of labour.
Collective agreements may, however, extend probation up to six months.
In small enterprises (i.e.
enterprises that employ 40 workers or less, and whose billing does not exceed a prescribed ceiling) the probation period is six months, and it can be further extended by collective agreement up to twelve months in respect of skilled workers.
The contract of employment can be suspended on various grounds, such as the employee's sickness, or maternity, holding of public office or of trade union office, and military service.
Other grounds for suspension are lack of work because of a downturn in demand, and disciplinary reasons, in which cases the suspension cannot be for more than thirty days within a twelve month period.
Below is a summary of the rules that apply in the case of termination of employment on the initiative of the employer:
termination based on the worker's conduct: the employer may terminate the contract of employment by summary dismissal if the worker fails to discharge his or her obligations under the contract to an extent that is prejudicial to it, and if the seriousness of this failure means that the relationship cannot continue.
In this case no notice is required, and no severance pay is due.
A worker may terminate the employment relationship by constructive dismissal, if the employer fails to discharge his or her obligations under the contract.
In this case the worker is entitled to payment in lieu of notice, and to an indemnity equal to that which is payable by the employer in the case of dismissal without cause.
Under Law 25323 (Official Bulletin of 11 October 2000) the amount of severance pay and compensation in lieu of notice is paid at twice the base rate (i.e.
a 50 per cent increase) if the employer failed to register the employment relationship.
This measure was adopted to fight against undeclared employment, which in 1999-2000 affected more than one third of all wage earners.
For additional information on termination of employment, see the Termination of Employment Digest.
The legal working time is eight hours per day and forty-eight hours per week.
However, the regular working week does not exceed 44 hours for daily work, 42 hours for night work, and 36 hours where work is performed in hazardous or unhealthy environments.
This is because work is normally not permitted on Saturday afternoon and Sunday.
Nonetheless, the competent authority may authorize exceptions to this rule, and in practice it does.
Paid leave is granted to workers who have completed at least six months of service with the same employer over a period of twelve calendar months.
Its length depends on the worker's seniority: it is 14 calendar days, when the worker has less than 5 years of service, 21 calendar days from 5 to 10 years of service, 28 calendar days from 10 to 20 years of service and, 35 calendar days when the workers' length of service is 20 years or more.
Furthermore, it is unlawful for an employer to terminate the employment of a woman during her pregnancy or absence on maternity leave, except on grounds unrelated to the pregnancy or birth.
The burden of proving that the reasons for dismissal are unrelated to pregnancy or childbirth rest on the employer.
Consequently, any dismissal that operates within a period of 7 ½ months before and 7 ½ months after childbirth is presumed to be due to pregnancy or maternity, provided the worker has submitted in due time a certificate proving she is pregnant.
If the employer fails to prove that the reason for dismissal is unconnected to pregnancy or maternity he/she would be obliged to pay an indemnity worth one year's salary, in addition to severance pay and notice that are due for regular termination of the contract of employment at the employer's initiative.
Young workers may not perform night work (i.e.
work performed between 20 hours and 6 hours the following day).
Any worker aged more than 18 years of age has the right to earn a remuneration not less than the minimum wage that has been fixed by the competent authority.
However, the minimum wage of most workers is determined in fact by collective agreements, which are negotiated at the industry or the branch level, and are legally binding on all workers and employers in the respective industries or branches.
This minimum may be increased by company level agreements or the individual contract of employment.
Trade unions are regulated by law 23351, adopted in 1988.
Under this law all workers have the right to establish and to join trade union associations of their choice, without prior authorization.
This include the right not to join a union, and to withdraw from a union.
Trade union leaders must be appointed by direct and secret ballot of the rank and file.
They may hold office for no more than four years, but they can be re-elected.
Collection of union dues by check off is mandatory under the trade union law.
This includes ordinary and extraordinary union dues that are due by all union members, as well as special contributions that may be due by all workers, including non union members, when a new collective agreement enters into force, and an agency shop clause has been agreed upon.
Any trade union is granted the right to represent their individual members.
However, for a union to be granted collective representation rights it is indispensable that it be certified as a trade union with union personality (personería gremial), upon fulfilment of the following requirements: (a) the union is officially registered and has been acting for at least six months; (b) its membership covers not less than 20 per cent of the workers it intends to represent; (c) it is the most representative trade union in the respective industry or branch, within a given territorial scope (frequently a city or a province, but may also be the national territory).
Apart from very few exceptions, only one union in each branch or industry, and within a given geographical area, is granted trade union personality.
This means that in practice the country has a single-union structure, since a union that is merely registered does not enjoy collective representation rights.
Moreover, enterprise level unions cannot be granted trade union personality where a branch level or an industry level union with trade union personality covers the respective geographical area for the industry or category corresponding to that enterprise.
In fact, enterprise level unions are all but inexistent.
The Ministry in charge of labour is the competent authority to register unions and to grant trade union personality.
It also determines which union represents such or such group of workers in case two or more unions compete for the representation of the same workers.
Its decisions may be challenged before the National Labour Court of Appeal.
The Trade Union Law specifies a number of unfair labour practices.
These include employers' interference in trade union activities, employers' economic support of a workers' union, anti-union discrimination, dismissal or other prejudicial measures against workers who engage in trade union activities; refusal to engage in collective bargaining, or obstruction of the collective bargaining process, or the refusal to provide a staff list for the purpose of holding internal elections of staff delegates.
Collective Bargaining is regulated by Law 14250, of 1954, which underwent a far-reaching reform in 2000.
Collective bargaining may be held at different levels, namely national, the provincial, local, industry-wide, branch-wide and company level.
It is also possible to conclude a collective agreement targeted at particular categories of workers within a given bargaining unit.
Yet, most workers are covered by national and industry-wide collective agreements, many of which date back to 1975 (only the pay scales have been updated since then).
This is why, under the recent reform (Law 25250, of 2000 Nueva Ley de Empleo Estable.doc) the Ministry in charge of Labour is to establish a calendar to renegotiate these agreements, within a timeframe of two years.
A slightly different provision applies to more recent collective agreements.
In any case it is now foreseen that collective agreements whose duration has expired may be denounced by either party, and would eventually cease to be binding after a transitional period has elapsed.
The parties to collective bargaining are on the one hand an employer, a group of employers, or an employers' association, and on the other hand a trade union enjoying trade union personality.
In practice, most national wide agreements are signed between a workers' federation or a national trade union, on the one side, and an Employers' Chamber with national coverage on the other side.
Company level agreements are signed by the individual enterprise, on the one hand, and a local level union, on the other hand, to the extent it enjoys trade union personality (not an enterprise level union, which normally does not enjoy trade union personality).
Under the newly approved law 25250 workers' delegates will be admitted at the bargaining table, which was not guaranteed under the previous law.
For a collective agreement to be binding, it must be approved by the ministry in charge of labour (this is called homologación).
Once approved, it is legally binding on all employers and workers included in the industry or the branch, within its territorial scope.
Collective agreements normally regulate wages and other conditions of work.
They also include provisions concerning interpretation and application, which is usually left to the competence of a tripartite commission.
Special rules have been enacted to regulate collective bargaining in the civil service and in the public education.
Workers' representation at the enterprise level is held by workers' delegates, or by internal committees.
Workers' delegates and members of internal committees are elected by all the workers in the enterprise, but they must be union members, and should have been working in the enterprise for at least one year before the election is held.
They hold office for two years, and can be re-elected.
They are granted a credit of paid hours of delegation, in keeping with the relevant collective agreement, and are protected against dismissal except the case of serious misconduct.
Such protection starts as from the moment they put forward their candidature and lasts until twelve months after their mandate has come to an end.
During such period they can neither be suspended from employment, transferred to another job or position, or otherwise prejudiced in their conditions of work.
Workers' delegates and internal committees may submit grievances to the employer, and they may accompany labour inspectors when the latter undertake inspections in the enterprise.
Pursuant to Law 25250, of 2000, they also have the right to participate at the bargaining table when collective bargaining is undertaken at the enterprise level.
Law 25250 has repealed previous legislation (however, rarely used), which permitted the public authority to submit a collective labour dispute to compulsory arbitration.
This Law has also created a Federal Service of Mediation and Arbitration, as an independent and technical body which would mediate in collective labour dispute.
This part of that law as yet has not been implemented.
Individual labour disputes are settled by tribunals established under the jurisdiction of the provinces.
However, in the city of Buenos Aires labour disputes are dealt with by national judges, since as yet there has been no transfer of judicial competences from the Nation to the City.
This is why labour judges in the city of Buenos Aires are still called National Judges, although they hear cases that in principle should fall within a territorial (provincial) jurisdiction.
Most of the provinces, and the State, have established a specialized jurisdiction to deal with individual labour disputes.
In all cases it is made up of magistrates.
Tripartite tribunals to deal with labour disputes are unknown in Argentinean practice.
The Supreme Court is not normally a jurisdiction in labour disputes.
It can however hear complaints, when a law or a decree is challenged on the ground it is not compatible with the Federal Constitution.
A conciliatory phase is mandatory within the jurisdiction of the City of Buenos Aires, before a complaint can be submitted to a labour tribunal.
A new overtime law went into effect in 2004.
Although it was generally referred to as the new overtime law, it was actually the regulations of a very old Federal law that lawmakers changed, entitled the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) .
The FLSA also regulates equal pay , child labor and the minimum wage .
Federal overtime law is enforced under the FLSA by the U.S. Department of Labor , Wage and Hour Division, for employees of private-sector businesses.
The Wage and Hour Division also enforces FLSA overtime law for employees of state and local governments, and Federal employees of the Library of Congress, U.S. Postal Service, Postal Rate Commission, and the Tennessee Valley Authority.
Federal overtime law does not require employers to pay overtime to employees who must work at night or on Saturdays, Sundays, holidays , or other "days of rest," unless the hours worked exceed 40 in one workweek.
It also does not require employers to pay overtime to employees for standby duty, also referred to as on-call duty (e.g., carrying a company pager or cell phone), unless the employer imposes additional restraints such that employees cannot effectively use their standby time for personal pursuits.
Federal overtime law does, however, require employers to pay overtime if they call employees to work from standby duty, and the employees end up working over 40 hours in the same workweek as a result.
It also generally requires employers to pay overtime if they make training mandatory during or outside of normal work hours, if the hours employees worked, including training time, exceed 40 in the same workweek.
Federal overtime law does not make mandatory overtime illegal, in that it does not limit the total number of hours that employers may make employees work per workweek, as do child labor laws.
Consequently, employers may force employees age 16 and over (18 and over if hazardous duty) to work mandatory overtime hours.
Congressmen reintroduced a bill in July, 2007, called the Safe Nursing and Patient Care Act of 2007 .
If it (or a future equivalent bill) passes, it will limit the number of mandatory overtime hours that nurses must work at certain patient-care facilities.
At this writing, some state legislators have enacted or are considering equivalent state overtime laws for nurses.
Written agreements between employees (or unions) and employers are allowed to include or expand the minimum protections afforded by Federal overtime law.
However, such agreements may not waive employee rights under the FLSA.
In other words, private-sector employers may not rightfully offer or force comp time in place of overtime pay.
However, private-sector employers may offer comp time as a reward, as long as it doesn't replace overtime pay (or the minimum wage ).
Regardless, many employers still offer or force comp time, in ignorance of Federal overtime law or intentionally to evade it.
States and municipalities are allowed to establish their own overtime laws that include or expand the minimum protections afforded by the FLSA.
Some have, while others have adopted the FSLA as is.
Consequently, some of the information in this article may differ under state and municipal FLSA equivalents.
Employees are protected by whichever law—Federal, state or municipal—is the most generous.
For example, at this writing, California overtime law requires employers to pay overtime for hours worked in excess of eight in any single workday, while the Federal FLSA requires employers to pay overtime only for work hours exceeding 40 total in a workweek.
California overtime law is more generous to eligible employees in other ways, too.
See State Labor Laws to look up your state's overtime law.
For more information or to report employer violations, start by contacting the Federal or your work state's department of labor .
The FLSA does not allow employers to retaliate against eligible employees for reasonably expecting their employers to pay them for overtime hours worked.
Employers also cannot retaliate against employees for reporting employers' actions that are outlawed under the FLSA or for participating in FLSA proceedings .
As a general principle employees have a right to terminate their employment with an employer and employers have the right to terminate the employment of employees.
These rights, however, come with responsibilities.
The main responsibility in most cases is to provide notice of intention to terminate.
The length of such notice is normally dependent on the duration of the employment with the employer.
The employer must pay all wages, overtime, general holiday pay and vacation pay due the employee within three days following termination of employment.
If an employee gives proper notice, the employer must pay all earnings to the employee within three days following termination of employment.
If an employee quits without proper notice all wages, overtime, holiday and vacation pay is due to the employee within 10 days after the date on which the notice would have expired if it had been given.
Other circumstances that permit an employer to terminate employment without giving notice include:
the employee refuses work made available through a seniority system,
the employee is not provided with work because a strike or lockout is taking place at the employee's place of employment,
When an employee's employment is terminated for 'just cause', the employer must pay all wages, overtime, general holiday pay and vacation pay due the employee within ten days following the date of termination.
The employer must be able to support their position that there was just cause for dismissal without notice.
no work is provided to the employee because there is a strike or lockout at the employee's place of employment
the employer reduces the wage rate, overtime rate, vacation pay, general holiday pay or termination pay.
The minimum wage of $8.80 per hour is used to calculate the minimum entitlement to overtime pay under a salary/bonus pay system.
An employee receives a bonus of $800 in the pay period in which he works 20 overtime hours and 10 hours on the general holiday.
How do you determine if the employee has received minimum entitlements?
For overtime hours worked and hours worked on the general holiday:
If a field service employee works in the shop, how is the payment of overtime affected?
Several statutes, taken together, make up the Austrian law on termination of employment at the initiative of the employer.
The most important are the Civil Code (CC), sec.
1162, the Works Constitution Act (WCA) and the White-Collar Employees Act.
While the WCA contains provisions concerning unfair dismissal generally, several laws provide protection from dismissal for specific categories of employees: the Job Security Act; the Disabled Persons Employment Act; the Maternity Protection Act; and the Paternal Leave Act.
Collective agreements and individual employment contracts may also provide special protection for the employee where the provisions are more favourable to the employee than those of the aforementioned legislation.
senior salaried employees with decisive influence in the management of the establishment;
Termination of employment at the initiative of the employer
Austrian law incorporates a distinction between summary dismissal, which immediately terminates the employment contract, and an ordinary dismissal with notice, which ends the employment contract at the end of the period of notice.
Summary dismissal.
A ground is required, but there is no remedy of reinstatement.
Summary dismissal presupposes that the employer cannot objectively be expected to continue the employment relationship, not even for the period of notice.
Sec. 1162 of the Civil Code generally provides that a labour contract can be dissolved for “important reasons” without notice.
The labour laws further specify what constitutes such important reasons.
betrayal of professional secrets and certain criminal acts;
prejudicial work on the side (moonlighting); and
the joining or belonging to trade union, or trade union activities;
Pursuant to sec.
45a of the Labour Market Support Act, there is a collective dismissal if the number of employees is to be reduced within four weeks:
The period of notice to which an employer is bound is typically in proportion to the period of employment (seniority principle).
However, the periods of notice differ for white-collar and blue-collar workers, and in addition there are also special periods of notice for particular occupations.
Collective agreements also frequently establish notice periods which are more beneficial to employees than the applicable statutes.
In the case of blue-collar workers, sec.
77, Commerce Regulations, specifies that in the absence of any other arrangement, notice shall be 14 days.
This provision, however, is not enforceable and may be shortened by contract or collective agreement.
In view of the above, longer notice periods are laid down in many industry-level collective agreements and some company agreements.
In current court practice, any period of notice which is less than that stipulated or which is set for an earlier date than permissible is considered as termination of an employment relationship at an early date.
It is therefore treated as “unfounded premature dismissal”.
Consequently, the employee is entitled to wages for the remaining period of time, that is, until the date when a regular termination of the employment relationship, in accordance with the period of notice, is possible.
Collective dismissals.
The works council is to be consulted, as with individual dismissals (sec.
105, Works Constitution Act), and shall be informed as soon as possible of any collective dismissals or intended alterations to the establishment, and shall discuss such alterations with the employer (sec.
109(1), (2), WCA).
Provision for measures to prevent, eliminate or alleviate the consequences may be made by works agreements in establishments where at least 20 employees are permanently employed.
Where agreement cannot be reached between the employer and the works council on the conclusion, amendment or revocation of any such works agreement and no arrangement for all settlements has been made by collective agreement or determination, a decision shall be taken by a disputes board if either of the parties so requests.
The 2002 Act governing employee retirement and provision of severance pay introduced a new severance pay scheme, which applies to all private employment relationships established after 1 January 2003.
Under the new scheme the employer is required to contribute 1.53 per cent of the monthly wage to an employee income provision fund.
Upon termination of the employment contract, the employee has an entitlement to severance pay from the fund.
The amount of the entitlement is based on the employer’s contributions to the fund and the interest accrued.
Payment in cash can only be requested if more than 36 monthly contributions were made in respect of the employee (by one or more employers) and if the contract is not terminated at the initiative of the employee or by summary dismissal.
However, in any case, the accrued capital is carried over to the next employment relationship.
For labour contracts concluded before 1 January 2003, the previous system of severance pay remains applicable.
Severance pay is due only if the employment relationship is terminated after a period of at least three years’ service in the organization.
The amount of severance pay is paid according to length of service as listed below.
However, collective/company agreements or individual contracts of employment may improve on these payments.
Employees are not entitled to severance pay if they terminate the employment contract or in case of summary dismissal.
Jurisdiction over disputes concerning unfair dismissal lies with the system of labour courts (sec.
105(4), WCA; sec.
50(1), Labour and Social Courts Act).
Two principal avenues of appeal exist.
Under sec.
105(3) of the WCA, unfair dismissal can be claimed on the grounds that it is:
in response to certain legitimate actions on the part of the employee (e.g.
trade union activity/membership, candidature for or membership in a works council, holding office as a health and safety representative, etc.
).
Compensation for unfair dismissal is usually limited to reimbursement of actual loss of earnings between dismissal and ruling; in the case of unfair summary dismissal, pay for the notice period is required.
If the court accepts the appeal, the dismissal is immediately declared invalid and, theoretically, the old working relationship resumes.
An individual dispute arises from a disagreement between an individual worker and his or her employer over an aspect of their employment relationship.
An individual dispute exemplifies a “rights dispute”, that is a dispute over the application of the terms of legislation or an existing agreement, whether a collective bargaining agreement or an individual written or oral contract of employment.
Thus there could be a dispute over the amount of wages paid or their manner of payment, work schedules, working conditions, entitlement to leave and so forth.
In the field of health and safety an individual dispute may arise in relation to the use of personal protective equipment, extra payments for carrying out dangerous work (hazard pay - a practice now frowned upon in favour of eliminating hazards), refusal to perform work that poses an imminent danger and observance of health and safety rules.
An individual dispute may be initiated by a worker complaining to vindicate what he or she believes to be a right, or reacting to employer-imposed disciplinary action or dismissal.
If a dispute involves similar claims on behalf of individual workers, or if an individual dispute raises a point of important principle for a trade union, an individual dispute can also lead to collective action and, where new rights are then sought, to an interests dispute.
For instance, a single worker who refuses to perform work that he or she thinks is too hazardous may be disciplined or even dismissed by the employer; if the trade union sees that this work poses a continuing danger for other workers, it may take up the issue with collective action, including a work stoppage (i.e., a lawful strike or a wildcat strike).
In this way, an individual dispute may lead to and become a collective dispute.
Similarly, the union may see a point of principle which, if not recognized, will lead it to make new demands, thus giving rise to an interests dispute in future negotiations.
The resolution of an individual dispute will depend largely upon three factors: (1) the extent of legal protection afforded to workers in a particular country; (2) whether or not a worker falls under the umbrella of a collective agreement; and (3) the ease with which a worker can have enforcement of his or her rights, whether they are afforded by law or collective agreement.
In most countries, however, certain rights enjoyed by an individual will be the same no matter what the length of his or her engagement or the size of the enterprise.
These normally include protection against victimization for trade union activity or for reporting to the authorities an employer’s alleged infringement of the law, called “whistle-blower” protection.
In most countries, the law affords protection to all workers against discrimination on the basis of race or sex (including pregnancy) and, in many cases, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin, marital status and family responsibilities.
Those grounds are all listed as improper bases for dismissal by the ILO Termination of Employment Convention, 1982 (No.
158), which also adds to them: union membership and participation in union activities; seeking office as, or acting or having acted as, a workers’ representative; and filing a complaint, or participating in proceedings against an employer involving alleged violation of laws or regulations, or having recourse to administrative authorities.
These last three are clearly of particular relevance to the protection of workers’ rights in the field of safety and health.
The ILO Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations recently highlighted the seriousness of retaliatory measures, in particular in the form of termination of employment, taken against a worker who reports the employer’s failure to apply occupational safety and health rules while the workers’ physical integrity, health and even lives may be at risk.
When fundamental rights or the physical integrity of lives of workers are at stake, it would be desirable for conditions as to proof (reversal of the burden of proof) and measures of redress (reinstatement) to be such as to allow the worker to report illegal practices without fearing reprisals (ILO 1995c).
An individual dispute may often arise around the question of an employee’s refusal to perform work that he or she believes to pose an imminent hazard; the belief must be that of a reasonable person and/or be held in good faith.
In the United States the reasonable belief must be that performance of the work constitutes an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury.
In some countries, this right is negotiated in collective bargaining; in others, it exists by virtue of legislation or court interpretations.
Unfortunately, this important right is not yet universally recognized, despite its inclusion as a basic principle in Article 13 of the ILO Occupational Health and Safety Convention, 1981 (No.
155). And even where the right exists in law, employees may fear retaliation or job loss for exercising it, particularly where they do not enjoy the backing of a trade union or an effective labour inspectorate.
Another way in which an individual dispute can arise in connection with a health and safety issue is the participation of an individual in strike action to protest unsafe working conditions.
His or her fate will depend on whether the work stoppage was lawful or unlawful and the extent to which the right to strike is guaranteed in the particular circumstances.
This will involve not only its status as a collective right, but how the legal system views the employee’s withdrawal of labour.
In many countries, going on strike constitutes a breach of the employment contract on the part of the employee and whether this will be forgiven or not may well be influenced by the overall power of his or her trade union vis-а-vis the employer and possibly the government.
A worker who has a strong theoretical right to strike but who can be temporarily or permanently replaced will be reluctant to exercise that right for fear of job loss.
In other countries, engaging in a lawful strike is explicitly made one of the grounds on which a worker’s employment may not be brought to an end (Finland, France).
The ways in which an individual dispute can be resolved are in general the same as those available for the resolution of collective disputes.
However, different labour relations systems offer varying approaches.
Some countries (e.g., Germany, Israel, Lesotho and Namibia) provide labour courts for the resolution of both collective and individual disputes.
The labour courts in Denmark and Norway hear only collective disputes; individual workers’ claims must go through the regular civil courts.
In other countries, such as France and the United Kingdom, special machinery is reserved for disputes between individual workers and their employers.
In the United States, individuals have rights to bring actions claiming unlawfщl employment discrimination before bodies that are distinct from those before which unfair labour practice claims are pressed.
However, in non-union situations, employer mandated arbitration for individual disputes is enjoying popularity despite criticism from labour practitioners.
Where an individual is covered by a collective bargaining agreement, his or her grievance can be pursued by the trade union under that agreement, which usually refers disputes to voluntary arbitration.
An individual’s ability to win a claim may ofien depend on his or her access to procedures that are fair, affordable and rapid and whether he or she has the support of a trade union or an able labour inspectorate.
Under applicable laws, employees are generally entitled to equal pay for equal work within the same establishment, regardless of race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age or disability.
Prior to the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 (linked below), the Equal Pay Act of 1963 was the best-known "equal pay law".
It amended the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and became one of the landmark Federal discrimination laws .
The Equal Pay Act prohibits employers from discriminating on the basis of gender, by paying unequal wages to men and women who perform essentially the same jobs.
The jobs don't have to be exactly the same, but must be substantially equal.
Ever since the Act became law, employers have been prohibited from paying unequal wages to men and women working essentially the same jobs, except only when based on a factor other than gender; examples are seniority and merit.
The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) enforces the Equal Pay Act of 1963.
It also enforces the following discrimination acts, which function as equal pay laws when applicable.
Collectively, the laws prohibit discrimination in any aspect of employment, including unequal wages, on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age or disability.
When making a determination under the applicable equal pay law, among other factors, the EEOC and the courts considers the skills, effort and responsibility required to do the job.
They also consider the working conditions in which the job is performed.
In other words, it's equal work under similar conditions that determines equal pay by law, not job titles.
However, equal pay for equal work applies only to similar jobs within the same establishment, not across the board.
An "establishment" is one or more physical places of business, depending on whether the employer hires centrally for all of its places of business or hires separately at each.
Additionally, all of the laws that enforce equal pay allow certain employee or employer exceptions.
If you reasonably believe that your employer has discriminated against you in violation of the Equal Pay Act or one of the other discrimination laws listed above, then you may file a pay discrimination charge against your employer with the EEOC or a state equivalent .
Under the Equal Pay Act, you do not have to file a discrimination charge with the EEOC before filing a private lawsuit, as you would under any other EEOC-enforced discrimination law.
(Private lawsuits typically reward better than EEOC enforcement actions.
) Still, it's a good idea to consult an attorney about filing a charge, just in case another discrimination law applies.
Attorneys often take discrimination cases on contingency .
For more information for both employees and employers, read " Equal Pay and Compensation Discrimination " and " Filing a Charge of Employment Discrimination " published by the EEOC; then, see Attorney Referral to find an appropriate lawyer to consult for legal advice regarding equal pay.
Of course, private-sector employers must pay employees for working on holidays.
But, under Federal law, they don't have to pay overtime to eligible workers for holiday work, unless their total work hours exceed 40 in the same workweek.
When due, private-sector employers are not required to pay more for holiday overtime work than the standard overtime rate, the same rate as for any other workday.
The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) is the "main pay law" so to speak, because it regulates equal pay , minimum wage and overtime pay at the Federal level for most employees.
But, it doesn't regulate or require holiday pay or holiday time off.
It also doesn't require more than the standard rate for holiday overtime work.
In other words, under the FLSA, holidays are the same as any other workday regarding hours and pay .
Private-sector employers have established paid holidays too, which are similar to public-sector legal paid holidays.
But, they did so voluntarily as a benefit to attract and retain employees, not because they were forced to by Federal law.
Some have also voluntarily offered a pay premium for work on holidays or more than the standard rate for holiday overtime work, such as double-time pay.
States may enact equivalent laws that are more generous than the FLSA.
But, many states, if not all, have simply adopted the FLSA's absence of paid holiday provisions "as is" for private-sector employees.
Some have enhanced the FLSA overtime and minimum wage provisions to the benefit of employees, but not specifically for overtime holiday pay.
But, you don't have to just take this writer's word for it.
To research your work state's laws regarding holiday pay, overtime holiday pay, legal paid holidays and related matters, start here .
Alternately or additionally, contact the relevant state labor department or consult an attorney .
Employment contracts and agreements , such as collective bargaining agreements , may grant holiday pay and holiday overtime benefits (such as double-time pay for holiday work) that state and Federal laws don't.
There is no Federal mandatory overtime law per se, that specifically regulates so-called forced overtime.
The only Federal "overtime law" is under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) , which also regulates equal pay , child labor and the minimum wage .
Federal overtime law under the FLSA does not prohibit employers from forcing employees to work mandatory overtime.
In other words, there are no protections under the FLSA for workers 16 and older who refuse to work mandatory overtime.
As a result, workers 16 and older who refuse to work it are "legally" subject to employer discipline, up to and including discharge .
If the related bill (or a future equivalent) passes, the Federal Safe Nursing and Patient Care Act of 2007 will restrict mandatory overtime for nurses at certain patient-care facilities that receive Medicare payments.
Some states have already enacted equivalent laws, while others are considering it.
Regardless, such restrictions are designed to protect patients more than nurses, from fatigue induced by mandatory overtime.
Under FLSA overtime law (exclusive of child-labor provisions), total daily and weekly work hours are a matter of contractual agreement between employers and employees or employers and unions .
In the absence of contractual agreements that restrict work hours (such as collective bargaining agreements ), employers may effectively force employees to work any number of mandatory overtime hours within reason.
If you are protected by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) or Rehabilitation Act , then your employer might be required to modify your mandatory overtime schedule to reasonably accommodate your disability .
Without union representation (or a potential disability protection mentioned above) and outside of filing a lawsuit, negotiating one-on-one or through your attorney is likely to be the only "legal" way to convince your employer to reduce your mandatory overtime work hours.
If that fails, then you'll likely have little choice but to involuntarily work the forced overtime or quit for a better job .
The state (or municipality) in which you work might have enacted its own overtime law, that has more generous employee provisions than the FLSA.
However, it's not likely to restrict the number of mandatory overtime hours for all workers.
To find out, start by checking with the relevant state labor department or consult an attorney .
Employers can't always get away with forcing mandatory overtime, such as by "squeezing" current workers to avoid hiring new workers.
Employee lawsuits against employers regarding excessive mandatory overtime are on the rise, particularly by salaried-exempt employees .
Because salaried-exempt employees are not eligible for overtime pay under the FLSA, employers may require them to work extra hours without extra pay.
Even so, when forced, excessive work hours became the "norm" every workweek, some salaried-exempt employees filed and won so-called mandatory overtime lawsuits.
Consult an attorney about challenging your employer's forcing of excessive mandatory overtime, through a lawsuit.
Overtime lawsuits are often class actions .
In contract negotiations, union workers too have won mandatory overtime concessions; for example, when employers forced it to avoid hiring new union workers.
Consult your union rep about that.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) published a Safety and Health Guide entitled " Extended/Unusual Work Shifts ".
It recommends that employers grant extra meal and rest breaks when work shifts exceed eight hours per day; but, it's only a guide with no legal teeth.
The CWHSSA is a Federal labor law that requires contractors with Federal contracts of over $100,000, to pay laborers and mechanics working under the contracts an overtime rate of at least 1.5 times their basic rate of pay.
Also prohibits unsanitary, hazardous or dangerous working conditions on Federal construction projects.
This landmark Federal labor law, sometimes referred to as the Wages and Hours Act, regulates minimum wage , overtime pay , equal pay and child labor .
The FLSA also prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who exercise their rights under the Act, such as reporting employer violations of the Act ( whistleblowing ).
Additionally, along with other Federal laws and regulations, the FLSA and its regulations prohibit employers from controlling independent contractors as employees .
Protects miners from unsafe and unhealthy work conditions and practices.
Also makes it unlawful for employers to discharge or discriminate against miners for reporting violations of the Act ( whistleblowing ), refusing to engage in any action made unlawful by the Act, or participating in any proceedings under the Act.
Not a labor law, but a bill introduced in Congress (see also H.R.2122 ).
If it passes, it will limit the number of mandatory overtime hours nurses must work at certain patient-care facilities that receive payments under the Medicare Program, to ensure quality patient care.
It will also prohibit patient-care facilities from retaliating or otherwise discriminating against nurses who refuse to work mandatory overtime hours (as defined by the Act) or who report violations of the Act.
If passed, it will amend Title XVIII of the Social Security Act listed below.
The Social Security Act of 1935 authorized the Social Security Board, now the Social Security Administration (SSA), to provide retirement, disability , Medicare health insurance, Supplemental Security Income, family, and survivors' benefits.
It also launched the unemployment insurance system for state-provided unemployment benefits .

USERRA grants returning military members the right to be re-employed in the jobs that they would have attained if they were not absent for military service, with the same seniority, status and pay , as well as other rights and employee benefits determined by seniority.
Also prohibits job discrimination against veterans because of their military service.

Requires contractors who furnish materials, supplies, articles, or equipment to the U.S. government or the District of Columbia per Federal contracts of over $10,000, to pay at least the federal minimum wage to employees who work under the contracts.
Also requires contractors to pay overtime to the same employees at a rate of at least 1.5 times their base pay.
See also the Davis-Bacon Act and the McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract Act.
Amended the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) to exclude from calculations for minimum wage and overtime pay , any value or income derived from employees' receiving or selling certain stock options.
This Act enabled employers to grant stock options to employees who are eligible for minimum wage and overtime pay, while requiring those employees to remain employed for specified periods of time to receive the benefits of their stock options.

As necessary for compliance with the requirements of the Code and notwithstanding any contrary provision of this subsection, payments under this subsection are subject to Section 13(1) through (p).
(iii) Parachute Payments.
If it is determined (as hereafter provided) that any payment, benefit or distribution by the Company to or for the benefit of Executive, whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise pursuant to or by reason of any other agreement, policy, plan, program or arrangement, including without limitation any stock option, restricted stock award, stock appreciation right or similar right, or the lapse or termination of any restriction on or the vesting or exercisability of any of the foregoing (a “Severance Payment”), would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (or any successor provision thereto) by reason of being “contingent on a change in ownership or control” of the Company, within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code (or any successor provision thereto) or to any similar tax imposed by state or local law, or any interest or penalties with respect to such excise tax (such tax or taxes, together with any such interest and penalties, are hereafter collectively referred to as the “Excise Tax”), then Executive shall receive the greater of (x) the aggregate amount of the Severance Payments, after payment by Executive of the Excise Tax imposed on the aggregate Severance Payments, and (y) the aggregate amount of the Severance Payments which could be paid to Executive under Section 280G of the Code without causing any loss of deduction to the Company under such Section (the “Capped Payments”).
If the Executive will be paid the Capped Payments pursuant to clause (y) above, then the Executive’s aggregate Severance Payments shall be reduced in the following order (i) cash severance pay that is exempt from Section 409A, (ii) any lump sum described in Section 8(c)(iii)(C)(I)(2), (iii) any other cash severance pay, (iv) any other cash payable that is a Severance Payment other than stock appreciation rights, (v) any stock appreciation rights, (vi) any restricted stock, and (vii) stock options.
The determination as to whether and to what extent payments are required to be reduced in accordance with this Section shall be made at the Company’s expense by a nationally recognized certified public accounting firm as may be designated by the Company prior to a change in control (the “Accounting Firm”).
In the event of any mistaken underpayment or overpayment under this Agreement, as determined by the Accounting Firm, the amount of such underpayment or overpayment shall forthwith be paid to Executive or refunded to the Company, as the case may be, with interest at of 120% of the applicable Federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code.
e. Notice of Termination.
Any purported termination of employment by the Company or by Executive (other than due to Executive’s death) shall be communicated by written Notice of Termination to the other party hereto in accordance with Section 13(h) hereof.
For purposes of this Agreement, a “Notice of Termination” shall mean a notice which shall indicate the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon and shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of employment under the provision so indicated.
(ii) Upon termination of Executive’s employment for any reason other than death or Disability, Executive agrees to execute a release of all then existing claims against the Company, its subsidiaries, affiliates, shareholders, directors, officers, employees and agents in relation to claims relating to or arising out of her employment or the business of the Company; provided, however, that any such release shall not bar or prevent Executive from responding to any litigation or other proceeding initiated by a released party and asserting any claim or counterclaim she has in such litigation or other proceeding as if no such release had been given as to such party, nor shall it bar Executive from claiming her rights that arise under, or that are preserved by, this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything set forth in this Agreement to the contrary, upon termination of Executive’s employment for any reason other than death or Disability, Executive shall not receive any payments or benefits to which she may be entitled hereunder (other than those which by law cannot be subject to the execution of a release, which shall be paid without regard to any release either (A) at the time when due, or (B) as of Executive’s Termination Date, if the specific payment or benefit is subject to Section 409A and a payment date sufficient to satisfy Section 409A is not otherwise stated for such payment or benefit) unless Executive satisfies the release requirements of this Section 8(f)(ii).
The release required by this Section 8(f)(ii) shall be provided to the Executive not later than the Termination Date and shall be substantially identical to the release attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A. To comply with this Section 8(f)(ii), Executive must sign and return the release within 45 days of the Termination Date, and Executive must not revoke it during a seven-day revocation period that begins when the release is signed and returned to the Company.
Then following the expiration of this revocation period, there shall occur the “Expiration Date,” which is the 53rd day following the Executive’s termination of employment.
(B) hire any such employee who was employed by the Company or its affiliates as of the date of Executive’s termination of employment with the Company or who left the employment of the Company or its affiliates coincident with, or within one year prior to or after, the termination of Executive’s employment with the Company.
n. Meaning of Termination of Employment.
Solely as necessary to comply with Section 409A and to this extent for purposes of Section 8(b)(ii), Section 8(b)(iii),Section 8(c)(iii), Section 8(d)(i), Section 8(f)(ii), Section 13(o), Section 13(p) and any other provision where this definition is specifically referenced, “termination of employment” shall have the same meaning as “separation from service” under Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Code.
In addition, to avoid having such a separation from service occur after the Executive’s termination of employment, the Executive shall not have (after the Executive’s termination of employment) any duties or responsibilities that are inconsistent with the termination of employment being treated as such a separation from service as of the date of such termination.
o. Installment Payments.
For purposes of Section 8(b)(ii)(B) with respect to amounts payable in the event of termination of employment on account of Disability and Section 8(c)(iii)(C) with respect to amount payable in the event of termination of Executive’s employment by the Company without Cause or by Executive with Good Reason or Constructive Termination Event, each such payment is a separate payment within the meaning of the final regulations under Section 409A.
Each such payment that is made within 2-1/2 months following the end of the year that contains the date of Executive’s termination of employment is intended to be exempt from Section 409A as a short-term deferral within the meaning of the final regulations under Section 409A, each such payment that is made later than 2-1/2 months following the end of the year that contains the date of Executive’s termination of employment is intended to be exempt under the two-times exception of Treasury Reg.
Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) up to the limitation on the availability of such exception specified in such regulation, and each such payment that is made after the two-times exception ceases to be available shall be subject to delay in accordance with Section 13(p) below.
p. Section 409A.
This Agreement will be construed and administered to preserve the exemption from Section 409A of payments that qualify as a short-term deferral or that qualify for the two-times exception.
With respect to other amounts that are subject to Section 409A, it is intended, and this Agreement will be so construed, that any such amounts payable under this Agreement and the Company’s and Executive’s exercise of authority or discretion hereunder shall comply with the provisions of Section 409A and the treasury regulations relating thereto so as not to subject Executive to the payment of interest and additional tax that may be imposed under Section 409A.
As a result, in the event Executive is a “specified employee” on the date of Executive’s termination of employment (with such status determined by the Company in accordance with rules established by the Company in writing in advance of the “specified employee identification date” that relates to the date of Executive’s termination of employment or, if later, by December 31, 2008, or in the absence of such rules established by the Company, under the default rules for identifying specified employees under Section 409A), any payment that is subject to Section 409A, that is payable to Executive in connection with Executive’s termination of employment, shall not be paid earlier than six months after such termination of employment (if Executive dies after the date of Executive’s termination of employment but before any payment has been made, such remaining payments that were or could have been delayed will be paid to Executive’s estate without regard to such six-month delay).
This Section 13(p) is an absolutely superseding provision under this Agreement.
This means that it will apply notwithstanding other provisions in the Agreement that permit or require payment at an earlier time (and notwithstanding terms in such other provisions that may provide for their application without regard to other provisions of the Agreement).
One of the main challenges facing working parents, and in particular those in the "sandwich generation," 1 is the lack of disposable time for family responsibilities, leisure activities and personal development.
Various types of workplace practices covered by collective agreement clauses allow employees to reduce the amount of time they spend at work.
The most common is of course part-time work.
But more innovative provisions such as partial leave, gradual retirement and job sharing also exist in a number of agreements.
On the other hand, an increased proportion of part-time jobs may be contrary to unions’ objectives for maintaining or increasing the number of full-time positions.
Part-time employment can also be considered unsatisfactory for those employees who would prefer working longer hours to increase their income, thereby ensuring a higher standard of living for their families.
In this sense, part-time work, when it is analogous to "underemployment," should not be considered a family-friendly practice.
One method of assuaging these concerns is to include ratio clauses limiting the proportion of part-time jobs compared to the overall level of employment.
Generally speaking, better part-time work provisions from an employee’s perspective are those that give prorated pay, offer continued access to benefits and allow an employee’s seniority ranking and service to be maintained.
If hours up to the stated restriction are not available, the employee shall have the option of returning to full-time status, commencing with the next posted work schedule.
This option shall also apply to members who after their reduction are faced with serious unforeseen circumstances such as the death of a spouse, financial difficulty, etc.
An increasing number of collective agreements now include provisions regarding phased or gradual retirement.
These allow older employees, usually with long service records, to progressively reduce their working time and workload over a period of time instead of abruptly shifting from full-time employment to retirement.
Subject to the deputy minister’s approval, [an employee can opt for] gradual retirement.
Gradual retirement is characterized by the fact that, for a maximum of three (3) years immediately before the employee’s full and permanent retirement, the employee can work part-time, with a preset schedule and working conditions applicable to part-time employees.
It is agreed that gradual retirement may involve a decreasing number of hours worked per week, to a minimum of fourteen (14).
During this period, the number of hours in the employee’s new work week becomes his/her guaranteed work week.
For pension purposes, there is full recognition of service for the duration of the gradual retirement.
The following graph reveals that the percentage (%) of major collective agreements containing job sharing clauses has increased slightly in the decade spanning 1988 to 1998.
The sharer and the supervisor will have the opportunity to interview the senior qualified candidate of the job posting.
The sharer will have the option of requesting a cancellation of the staffing process at any point up until the offer of employment is made to the candidate.
Many job sharing provisions found in major Canadian collective agreements are for an undefined/indeterminate period.
However, this does not imply that they are permanent.
The vast majority of agreements enable the employer, and usually the employees involved and/or their union, to cancel a job sharing arrangement, provided advance notice is given.
If the job sharing arrangement is terminated by the employer, thirty (30) days written notice must be given to the affected employees with a copy to the union.
An appeal mechanism that somewhat limits unilateral management termination of job sharing arrangements appears in one collective agreement.
But in this example, the employer, who has representatives on the monitoring committee, can still ultimately decide whether or not a job sharing arrangement is to be terminated.
An important issue is how to deal with the remaining employee(s) should a job sharing arrangement be terminated.
This has been addressed in many collective agreements by establishing specific mechanisms, some of which provide better job protection than others.
If the job-share arrangement is terminated at the annual review, and both incumbents were previously full-time Employees, the position shall be offered to the most senior Employee on a full-time basis without posting the position.
Employees in job sharing arrangements are paid for the hours they work, either on the basis of hourly wages or by means of a prorated salary.
However, the consequences of job sharing on seniority accrual and benefits vary depending on the collective agreement.
Although seniority accrual is typically prorated for job sharers (i.e.
based on hours/days worked instead of calendar years in the employer’s service), some agreements allow seniority accrual at the same rate as for full-time work.
This is of course an incentive for young parents or other employees who may wish to reduce their hours of work but who would hesitate to do so if it could lead, in the long term, to a lower seniority ranking and, hence, to less job security.
An employee in the job share program will receive a full year credit for seniority purposes regardless of the number of hours worked during the year.
In most job sharing agreements, benefits (including pensions and vacations) are either prorated, or are calculated on the basis of part-time employment status.
In a few instances, full fringe benefits are available, but employees must agree to pay a portion of the employer’s premiums (once again, usually on a prorata basis).
Other systems exist whereby job sharing employees have access to the same fringe benefits as full-time employees, but have upper limits placed on the amount of annual coverage, or additional deductibles.
This is sometimes done by offering only singles’ benefits, with no coverage for family members.
A young girl working in a brickyard in Victorian England, 1871.
Factory owners exploited children, sometimes just five or six years of age, to work long, hard hours in poor conditions.
In 1878 the first significant legislation against child labour banned the employment of children under 10 years of age and restricted the hours of those aged between 10 and 14.
In the middle of the 18th century social status and traditional ties to the land still influenced relations between employers and workers.
The rise of the towns slowly broke down the ties of inborn status, and the Industrial Revolution completed the ‘movement from status to contract’, with contracts between employer and worker made freely for each job.
The domestic workshop was replaced by the factory.
Long hours, poor conditions, child labour, and other evils had been common in the domestic system.
But when workers were brought together in large numbers in cotton mills and factories, public attention was drawn to these conditions.
The workers were expected to work long hours; 12–14-hour days were common, even for children, with even longer hours during the ‘brisk’ times, when there were many orders to fill.
Conditions were unhealthy; the cotton mills were damp and hot, dust and fluff caused diseases of the lungs, and the noise damaged the workers' hearing.
The children, undernourished and standing too long, grew up with twisted spines, bow legs, and knock-knees.
Accidents were caused by unguarded machinery.
Discipline was harsh, and routinely involved flogging and fines, and there was low pay and insecurity of employment.
Child employment was usual, with some factories employing children from the age of five.
Some were ‘apprentices’ – orphans, sent by the local poor law guardians to live and work for the mill-owners, whose position amounted to little better than slaves.
For the first time it was thought necessary to bring the factories under control by act of Parliament.
Until 1878 the law was unsystematic, and acts of Parliament were passed to deal with one problem at a time.
In 1878, however, the Factory and Workshop Act appeared.
As well as consolidating earlier legislation, this act made some changes.
It increased the minimum age of child labour in textile factories to ten and provided for holidays and for breaks in the working day.
Further acts came in 1883, 1889, 1891, 1895, and 1897, and soon led to a second consolidating act in 1901.
The acts from 1878 to 1895 were mainly to develop specialized hygiene in factory life; widen the effect of the ordinary Public Health Acts to factories and workshops by transferring powers from the factory inspectors to local sanitary authorities; improve accident safety, for example by the adequate fencing of machinery in factories; restrict employment of women shortly after childbirth; control overtime work; and reduce working hours for children.
Before the Federal Wage System, inequity was not uncommon.
A janitor in one agency in a geographic area could have been paid a certain hourly rate while a janitor just across town but in a different agency, performing the same work and with the same seniority, could have been paid substantially less.
This was clearly unfair, yet for many years there was no central authority to establish wage equity for Federal trade, craft, and laboring employees.
Then in 1965, President Lyndon Johnson ordered the Civil Service Commission (predecessor of the Office of Personnel Management) to work with Federal agencies and labor organizations to study the jumble of different agency systems and combine them into a single wage system that would be sensible and just.
That there be equal pay for equal work and pay distinctions in keeping with work distinctions.
The Office of Personnel Management also defines the geographic boundaries of individual local wage areas and reviews survey job descriptions to ensure that they are accurate and current.
For each wage area, the Office of Personnel Management identifies the "lead" agency­-that is, the Federal agency with the most trade, craft, and laboring employees in that wage area.
The lead agency for each wage area is responsible for conducting wage surveys, analyzing data, and issuing wage schedules under the policies and procedures prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management.
Each lead agency is advised by an Agency Wage Committee.
All agencies in a wage area pay their hourly wage employees according to the wage schedules developed by the lead agency.
Labor organizations also play an important role in the wage determination process by providing representatives to the two Federal Wage System committees which are deeply involved in this process.
The employee unions having the greatest number of wage employees under exclusive recognition in each lead agency are named the "lead" unions and designate two of the five members of a lead agency's national level Wage Committee.
Locally, the union with the most employees under exclusive recognition in a wage area designates one of the three members of each Local Wage Survey Committee.

Indeed, flexicurity could have easily degenerated into an ideological attack on labour law and job protection systems undermining their crucial function of promoting stable contracts and stable employment relationships.
• What we do want and call for instead is a review of the design of labour law and job protection systems with the aim of complementing job protection with measures promoting employment security;
• What we also call for is to fight segmented labour markets by closing existing loopholes in labour law and by upgrading the rights of a-typical workers.
In short, we want upwards convergence and a labour market in which open ended contracts are the general rule.
And all of this should be done in close collaboration and respect of social partners and their autonomy to bargain flexicurity arrangements.
The Employment Council has already re-opened the discussion on equal rights for temporary agency workers and we welcome this move.
More could be done.
For example, in terms of the possibility for workers to request flexible working hours or a shift to full time or part time contracts and back.
These would address phenomena such as involuntary part time work or qualified workers taking up lower skilled part time jobs to be able to combine work and family life.
Before planning to work abroad, you must ensure that it will be possible before making any commitments.
If you don't qualify to live and work in a country by birthright or as a national of a country that's a member of a treaty (such as the European Union), obtaining a work permit may be impossible.
Americans and others without the automatic right to work in the EU must have their employment approved by a country's Ministry of Labour and obtain an employment visa before arriving in an EU country.
Most Europeans find it equally difficult to obtain a permit to work in the USA or Canada (unless they buy a business).
One of the easiest routes to working abroad is to be self-employed, although you will still need a work permit and it can be difficult to become established and make a good living.
If you're an EU national or a permanent resident with a residence permit, you can work as a self-employed person or as a sole trader in a European Union country.
If you want to be self-employed in a profession or trade in many countries, e.g.
most European Union countries, you must meet certain legal requirements and register with the appropriate organisation, e.g.
a professional must become a member of the relevant professional association.
In many countries, the self-employed must have an official status and it's illegal to simply hang out a sign and start business.
When looking for a job abroad, it's best not to put all your eggs in one basket, as the more job applications you make, the better your chances of finding a good job.
Contact as many prospective employers as possible, either by writing, telephoning or calling on them in person, depending on the type of vacancy.
Whatever job you're looking for, it's important to market yourself correctly and appropriately, which depends on the type of job you're after.
For example, the recruitment of executives and senior managers is handled almost exclusively by consultants who advertise in local newspapers (and also abroad) and interview all applicants prior to presenting clients with a shortlist.
At the other end of the scale, manual jobs requiring no previous experience may be advertised at government employment centres, in local newspapers and in shop windows, and the first suitable, able‑bodied applicant may be offered the job on the spot.
Working conditions in most countries are largely dependent on an employee's individual contract of employment and an employer's general employment conditions.
Many aspects of working conditions are set by governments, and although many employers' pay and conditions are more generous than the statutory minimum, employers in many countries offer pay and conditions that are actually illegal.
In many countries there's a huge disparity between the working conditions of hourly paid workers and salaried employees (i.e.
monthly paid), even those employed by the same company.
As in most countries, managerial and executive staff generally enjoy a much higher level of benefits than lower paid employees.
Employees hired to work abroad by a multinational company may receive a higher salary (including fringe benefits and allow­ances) than those offered by local employers.
Nationals of EU member states working in other EU countries have the same rights as local citizens, for example with regard to pay, working conditions, vocational training and trade union membership.
The employment conditions of non‑EU nationals are generally the same as for EU nationals, although employment is usually subject to the granting of a work permit and its renewal.
Employment conditions may include the validity and applicability; place of work; salary and benefits; extra months' salary and bonuses; working hours and flexi‑time rules; overtime and compensation; travel and relocation expenses; social security; company pension plan; accident insurance; unemployment insurance; salary insurance; health insurance; miscellaneous insurance; use of company cars; notification of sickness or accident; sick pay and disability benefits; annual and public holidays; compassionate and special leave of absence; allowances and paid expenses; probationary and notice periods; education and training; health and safety; pregnancy and confinement; part‑time job restrictions; changing jobs and confidentiality; acceptance of gifts; retirement; military service; discipline and dismissal; severance pay; and trade union membership.
2) Seniority: Most union workplaces have a seniority system.
The amount of time you have on the job may determine your benefit levels.
For example, the contract may state that if there are layoffs, the people who have been at work for the longest period of time must be laid off last and the people who have been at work for the shortest time must be laid off first.
Different contracts have different types of seniority clauses.
The contract says that there is a seniority system -- people who have been on the job longer get to choose their hours before people who have not been on the job as long.
She has worked much longer than the new people who are getting more hours, so the company has violated the contract!
Minimum wage and overtime: If you are paid below minimum wage or do not receive overtime pay when you work more than 40 hours in one week, you can file with the Department of Labor for your state.

The Secretary is authorized to enter into an agreement with the Librarian of Congress with respect to individuals employed in the Library of Congress to provide for the carrying out of the Secretary's functions under this chapter with respect to such individuals.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, or any other law, the Director of the Office of Personnel Management is authorized to administer the provisions of this chapter with respect to any individual employed by the United States (other than an individual employed in the Library of Congress, United States Postal Service, Postal Rate Commission, or the Tennessee Valley Authority).
Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to affect the right of an employee to bring an action for unpaid minimum wages, or unpaid overtime compensation, and liquidated damages under section 216 (b) of this title.
No employer shall be deemed to have violated subsection (a) of this section by employing any employee for a workweek in excess of that specified in such subsection without paying the compensation for overtime employment prescribed therein if such employee is so employed:
No employer shall be deemed to have violated subsection (a) of this section by employing any employee for a workweek in excess of the maximum workweek applicable to such employee under subsection (a) of this section if such employee is employed pursuant to a bona fide individual contract, or pursuant to an agreement made as a result of collective bargaining by representatives of employees, if the duties of such employee necessitate irregular hours of work, and the contract or agreement
(h) Credit toward minimum wage or overtime compensation of amounts excluded from regular rate
No employer engaged in the operation of a hospital or an establishment which is an institution primarily engaged in the care of the sick, the aged, or the mentally ill or defective who reside on the premises shall be deemed to have violated subsection (a) of this section if, pursuant to an agreement or understanding arrived at between the employer and the employee before performance of the work, a work period of fourteen consecutive days is accepted in lieu of the workweek of seven consecutive days for purposes of overtime computation and if, for his employment in excess of eight hours in any workday and in excess of eighty hours in such fourteen-day period, the employee receives compensation at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he is employed.
For a period or periods of not more than fourteen workweeks in the aggregate in any calendar year, any employer may employ any employee for a workweek in excess of that specified in subsection (a) of this section without paying the compensation for overtime employment prescribed in such subsection, if such employee:
In the case of employees described in clause (A)(ii) hired prior to April 15, 1986, the regular practice in effect on April 15, 1986, with respect to compensatory time off for such employees in lieu of the receipt of overtime compensation, shall constitute an agreement or understanding under such clause (A)(ii).
Except as provided in the previous sentence, the provision of compensatory time off to such employees for hours worked after April 14, 1986, shall be in accordance with this subsection.
Any employer may employ any employee for a period or periods of not more than 10 hours in the aggregate in any workweek in excess of the maximum workweek specified in subsection (a) of this section without paying the compensation for overtime employment prescribed in such subsection, if during such period or periods the employee is receiving remedial education that is:
Any employer who violates the provisions of section 206 or section 207 of this title shall be liable to the employee or employees affected in the amount of their unpaid minimum wages, or their unpaid overtime compensation, as the case may be, and in an additional equal amount as liquidated damages.
Any employer who violates the provisions of section 215 (a)(3) of this title shall be liable for such legal or equitable relief as may be appropriate to effectuate the purposes of section 215 (a)(3) of this title, including without limitation employment, reinstatement, promotion, and the payment of wages lost and an additional equal amount as liquidated damages.
An action to recover the liability prescribed in either of the preceding sentences may be maintained against any employer (including a public agency) in any Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction by any one or more employees for and in behalf of himself or themselves and other employees similarly situated.
No employee shall be a party plaintiff to any such action unless he gives his consent in writing to become such a party and such consent is filed in the court in which such action is brought.
The court in such action shall, in addition to any judgment awarded to the plaintiff or plaintiffs, allow a reasonable attorney's fee to be paid by the defendant, and costs of the action.
The right provided by this subsection to bring an action by or on behalf of any employee, and the right of any employee to become a party plaintiff to any such action, shall terminate upon the filing of a complaint by the Secretary of Labor in an action under section 217 of this title in which
The Secretary is authorized to supervise the payment of the unpaid minimum wages or the unpaid overtime compensation owing to any employee or employees under section 206 or section 207 of this title, and the agreement of any employee to accept such payment shall upon payment in full constitute a waiver by such employee of any right he may have under subsection (b) of this section to such unpaid minimum wages or unpaid overtime compensation and an additional equal amount as liquidated damages.
The Secretary may bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to recover the amount of unpaid minimum wages or overtime compensation and an equal amount as liquidated damages.
The right provided by subsection (b) of this section to bring an action by or on behalf of any employee to recover the liability specified in the first sentence of such subsection and of any employee to become a party plaintiff to any such action shall terminate upon the filing of a complaint by the Secretary in an action under this subsection in which a recovery is sought of unpaid minimum wages or unpaid overtime compensation under sections 206 and 207 of this title or liquidated or other damages provided by this subsection owing to such employee by an employer liable under the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, unless such action is dismissed without prejudice on motion of the Secretary.
Any sums thus recovered by the Secretary of Labor on behalf of an employee pursuant to this subsection shall be held in a special deposit account and shall be paid, on order of the Secretary of Labor, directly to the employee or employees affected.
Any such sums not paid to an employee because of inability to do so within a period of three years shall be covered into the Treasury of the United States as miscellaneous receipts.
In determining when an action is commenced by the Secretary of Labor under this subsection for the purposes of the statutes of limitations provided in section 255 (a) of this title, it shall be considered to be commenced in the case of any individual claimant on the date when the complaint is filed if he is specifically named as a party plaintiff in the complaint, or if his name did not so appear, on the subsequent date on which his name is added as a party plaintiff in such action.
No employer shall be subject to any liability or punishment under this chapter (in any action or proceeding commenced prior to or on or after January 24, 1950), on account of the failure of said employer to pay an employee compensation for any period of overtime work performed prior to July 20, 1949, if the compensation paid prior to July 20, 1949, for such work was at least equal to the compensation which would have been payable for such work had subsections (d)(6), (7) and (g) of section 207 of this title been in effect at the time of such payment.
The district courts, together with the United States District Court for the District of the Canal Zone, the District Court of the Virgin Islands, and the District Court of Guam shall have jurisdiction, for cause shown, to restrain violations of section 215 of this title, including in the case of violations of section 215 (a)(2) of this title the restraint of any withholding of payment of minimum wages or overtime compensation found by the court to be due to employees under this chapter (except sums which employees are barred from recovering, at the time of the commencement of the action to restrain the violations, by virtue of the provisions of section 255 of this title).
shall have his basic compensation fixed or adjusted at a wage rate that is not less than the appropriate wage rate provided for in section 206 (a)(1) of this title (except that the wage rate provided for in section 206 (b) of this title shall apply to any employee who performed services during the workweek in a work place within the Canal Zone), and shall have his overtime compensation set at an hourly rate not less than the overtime rate provided for in section 207 (a)(1) of this title.
No.
The FMLA only requires unpaid leave.
However, the law permits an employee to elect, or the employer to require the employee, to use accrued paid leave, such as vacation or sick leave, for some or all of the FMLA leave period.
When paid leave is substituted for unpaid FMLA leave, it may be counted against the 12-week FMLA leave entitlement if the employee is properly notified of the designation when the leave begins.
No.
The 1,250 hours include only those hours actually worked for the employer.
Paid leave and unpaid leave, including FMLA leave, are not included.
Employers with established policies regarding outside employment while on paid or unpaid leave may uniformly apply those policies to employees on FMLA leave.
Otherwise, the employer may not restrict your activities.
The protections of FMLA will not, however, cover situations where the reason for leave no longer exists, where the employee has not provided required notices or certifications, or where the employee has misrepresented the reason for leave.
On the other hand, FMLA does not require that employees on FMLA leave be allowed to accrue benefits or seniority.
For example, an employee on FMLA leave might not have sufficient sales to qualify for a bonus.
The employer is not required to make any special accommodation for this employee because of FMLA.
The employer must, of course, treat an employee who has used FMLA leave at least as well as other employees on paid and unpaid leave (as appropriate) are treated.
This led to two Court of Justice rulings seeking to clarify the issue.
In the SIMAP and Jaeger cases in 2000 and 2003, the Court ruled that time spent on call by health professionals had to be counted as working time.
As a result of this case-law, time spent on call by health professionals has to be regarded entirely as working time, and where appropriate as overtime, if they are required to be at their place of employment, even if they are resting.
Why is the Commission now proposing more legislation and how were the social partners involved?
The Commission consulted the two sides of industry on the need to revise the existing directive and asked them to negotiate an agreement on amendments to it, in accordance with the Treaty (Article 137).
However, the European social partners were unable to find sufficient common ground to start negotiations and declined the Commission's invitation to do so.
The new proposal nonetheless gives the social partners a bigger role in implementing key provisions of the directive and sets out the framework within which they will operate.
night work is restricted to an average of eight hours in any 24-hour period (Article 8)
The maximum week of 48 hours is calculated as an average over a standard reference period of four months (Article 16).
This gives employers flexibility to organise work patterns in accordance with the nature of the work.
In certain cases, the reference period can be extended to six months, e.g.
for employees who work a long way from home, security guards, journalists, postal workers, agricultural workers or transport workers.
In addition, Member States can allow the reference period to be extended to up to one year, under a collective agreement (Article 18).
expressly allowed under a collective agreement or an agreement between the social partners
If no collective agreement is applicable and there is no workers' representation empowered, according to national rules, to negotiate an agreement (which may be the case in small and especially micro businesses), the worker's individual consent has to be obtained by the employer.
The proposal does not include a definition of "workers’ representation empowered to negotiate" but leaves this to national law and/or practice.
The existence of a body for information and consultation of workers, as required under other EU legislation, will not necessarily constitute workers’ representation for the purposes of this proposal.
However, it also gives Member States the option, under national law or by collective agreement or agreement between the two sides of industry, of counting the inactive part of on-call time as working time.
However, Member States have the option, in the proposal, of extending it to one year, provided that the social partners are consulted and social dialogue is encouraged.
In that case, the workers cannot work more than 65 hours in any week.
What does "exempt" mean?
When an employee is exempt from the FLSA, it means that that employee is not entitled to the benefits and protections of the FLSA, and you, as an employer, are not subject to its rules for that employee.
That means that an exempt employee may not have to be paid minimum wage or paid in accordance with the overtime requirements specified by the FLSA, for example.
What does nonexempt mean?
When an employee is classified as nonexempt, it means that the employee is entitled to a minimum wage , overtime pay at the rate of time and one-half the regular rate for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours per week, as well as other protections under child labor and equal pay , as prescribed by the FLSA.
If you want to treat an employee as exempt, you must pay him or her a salary.
Employees who are paid by hourly wage are automatically considered to be nonexempt.
However, you can have nonexempt employees who are paid by salary.
Which employees are considered "exempt?
" An exemption from the minimum wage, equal pay, overtime pay and child labor provisions of the FLSA applies to:
An exemption from the minimum wage, equal pay, and overtime requirements of the FLSA (but not the child labor laws) applies to:
Effective August 23, 2004, the Department of Labor has revised the exemptions for the federal overtime pay laws.
An exemption from the minimum wage and overtime laws (but not the equal pay or child labor laws) applies to:
Executives: an employee is an executive if the employee's primary duty is (1) management-related and the employee (2) customarily and regularly directs the work of two or more employees including the authority to hire or fire other employees or is in a position to make suggestions and recommendations as to the hiring, firing, advancement, promotion or another change of status of other employees that will be given particular weight.
Retail supervisors are included under the executive exemption, even if they perform the same duties as subordinates, if they also perform managerial functions including assigning work, scheduling employees, and/or managing inventory.
Computer: an employee who is a computer systems analyst, a computer programmer, a software engineer, or is a similarly skilled worker in the computer field is exempt from the overtime pay rules if the primary duties performed consist of the application of systems analysis techniques and procedures; the design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems and/or programs based on and related to user or system design specifications; the design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or a combination of these duties, requiring the same level of skills.
The minimum salary level to qualify for exemption from the overtime requirements as an executive, administrative, professional or computer employee is $455 per week or $23,660 annually.
An employee paid below this minimum salary level is not exempt from the FLSA overtime pay rules even if the employee meets the executive, administrative, professional or computer job duty requirements.
Employees who own a 20 percent or more interest in a business and are employed by that business and actively engaged in its management do not have to meet the overtime pay salary requirements for exempt employees.
The provisions of the Civil Service Law dealing with removal for incompetency or misconduct apply to permanent competitive class employees, and, except as noted below, honorably discharged war veterans and exempt volunteer firefighters holding a position by permanent appointment in the classified service.
State and local employees holding non-competitive class position by permanent appointment for at least five years are likewise covered.
In addition, a probationer who has not completed eight weeks of service is entitled to notice and hearing pursuant to Section 75 if he/she is to be removed from the position for misconduct or incompetence before the end of the minimum probationary period.
However, such individuals may be terminated without recourse to Section 75 after eight weeks and up to the end of the maximum period of their probationary term.
A war veteran and an exempt volunteer firefighter serving in the exempt, non-competitive or labor class, is not covered by Section 75 if he/she holds the position of private secretary, cashier or deputy of any official or department.
In addition, if the Civil Service Commission designates a non-competitive class position as confidential or policy influencing, the incumbent is not protected by the provisions of Section 75.
An employee who is found guilty is entitled, upon request, to be furnished a copy of the transcript of the hearing without charge.
Also, when an employee is found guilty, a copy of the charges, the written answer, the transcript of the hearing and the determination must be placed on file in the office of the department or agency in which he/she has been employed.
Copies must be filed with the State Civil Service Commission.
An employee who is dismissed, demoted, suspended without pay, fined or reprimanded, unaccompanied by a remittance of his/her prehearing suspension without pay, may appeal either to the State Civil Service Commission or to the courts.
If he/she elects to appeal to the Commission, the appeal must be filed in writing within 20 days after receipt of the written notice of the determination.
The Commission reviews the record of the disciplinary proceeding and the transcript of the hearing, and makes a determination on the basis of such record and transcript and such oral or written argument as it may deem necessary.
No new evidence may be presented before the State Civil Service Commission or its designated representative.
The record is reviewed to determine whether the decision of the appointing officer is based on substantial evidence, whether procedural rights and safeguards have been observed, and whether the penalty imposed is reasonable in light of all the circumstances.
The Commission may affirm, reverse or modify the determination appealed.
It may, in its discretion, direct the reinstatement of the employee or permit transfer to a vacancy in a similar position in another division or department, or direct that the employee's name be placed on a preferred list.
In appropriate circumstances the Commission may arrange a transfer of the employee, in order to avoid the difficult and unproductive work situation that might ensue were he/she returned to his/her former job.
The employee is entitled to back pay for the period of his/her removal less unemployment insurance benefits.
No adjustment is made for other earnings during that time.
The Civil Service Law also contains provisions favoring war veterans and exempt volunteer firefighters who are laid off upon the abolition of positions in the non-competitive or labor jurisdictional class.
The law provides that if the non-competitive or labor class position of a veteran or exempt volunteer firefighter is abolished, he/she shall be entitled to transfer to any similar position where a vacancy exists and receive the same compensation.
He/she does not have a right to bump a non-veteran, nor does the law mean that a veteran or exempt volunteer firefighter must be given a vacant position even if there are no duties to perform in the position.
In other words, it does not mandate the filling of a position that would otherwise stay vacant because of lack of work.
However, it does give the laid off war veteran or exempt volunteer firefighter the right of preference to employment in similar positions over others who might otherwise be appointed to such positions.
It is incumbent upon the veteran to seek and find such positions.
A civil service employee who is a member of the organized militia or any or the reserve forces of the Armed Forces of the United States shall be deemed to be on leave of absence while performing ordered military duty.
Ordered military duty is defined as any duty performed pursuant to orders issued without the employee's consent; or even though such orders are issued with the consent of the employee, for periods not exceeding a total of 30 calendar days or 22 working days in one calendar year, or any continuour period of absense.
A civil service employee who is a member of a reserve component shall be deemed to be on leave of absence while attending any service school conducted by the Armed Forces, or while in full-time training or active duty for training, even though such orders are issued with the consent of the employee.
The Military Law provides certain rights pertaining to civil service examinations.
A person serving on active duty in the armed forces of the United States during the filing period for a civil service examination, or a person who has been honorably discharged after an examination filing period shall be permitted to file an application for such examination no later than 10 business days prior to the scheduled examination date or the last date to file for such examination, whichever is later.
If qualified, such person shall be allowed to compete in such examination.
Further, any member of the Armed Forces of the United States who duly filed an application for a civil service examination but was deprived of an opportunity to compete because of active military duty shall be afforded a military make-up examination.
If a public employee is on regular military duty and a promotion examination is held for which the employee is entitled to take, the employee may take a comparable examination if a request is made within 60 days after restoration to his/her position.
If the employee passes the comparable examination, his/her name is placed on the regular eligible list, provided it still exists.
If the final rating is such that the employee would have been reached for certification for appointment between the date when he/she entered military duty and the date that he/she was officially notified of his/her rating, his/her name is placed on a special eligible list.
The special list remains in existence for two years and is certified before any subsequent list, including a preferred list.
If the employee is promoted from the special eligible list, he/she is entitled to retroactive seniority, for purposes of computing seniority, training and experience credit upon promotion to the earliest date on which any eligible who was ranked lower on the regular promotion list was promoted.
The employee is not, however, entitled to have seniority backdated for salary purposes.
Military Law also provides that if a person's name is on an open-competitive or promotion eligible list when he/she enlists or is drafted into military duty, that person may, at the discretion of the appointing officer, be appointed from such list and then placed on military leave of absence until he/she returns from military duty.
In such case, he/she earns seniority and salary credit from the date of appointment.
A person on an eligible list who is not so appointed while on regular military duty may have his/her name placed on a special eligible list following return, provided the person has been reached for certification during military duty and the original eligible list is still in existance..
Such a special list will continue for a period of two years following termination of military duty and is certified before any subsequent eligible lists, including a preferred list.
If an eligible is appointed from such a special list, he/she is entitled to retroactive seniority for the purposes of computing seniority, training and experience credit upon promotion, and seniority in the event of layoff, to the earliest date upon which any eligible who was lower on the original list was appointed.
Unlike federal employees, most people in the service of the State of New York are not prohibited from taking part in or contributing to partisan political campaigns in their off-duty hours.
At the same time, they are protected by the Civil Service Law from having political influence imposed upon them in their jobs.
This law provides that no employee shall be questioned concerning his/her political affiliations or compelled to contribute to any political fund, that no person shall be appointed or discharged on the basis of political opinions or affiliations and that no person shall use his/her official position or authority to compel political action or allegiance from subordinates.
Strikes by public employees against the State or any public authority or local governmental jurisdiction, including a school district, are prohibited by Article 14 of the Civil Service Law, also known as the Taylor Law.
State officers and employees who are designated as "policymakers" by their appointing authority, or who earn in excess of the job rate of SG-24, as set forth in Section 130(1)(9) of the Civil Service Law, or above and are not otherwise exempted, must file an Annual Statement of Financial Disclosure with the State Ethics Commission.
In addition, depending on the amount to be earned, such persons must obtain the permission of their appointing authority and, in certain cases, the State Ethics Commission before undertaking compensated outside activities.
No payroll may be approved or paid by any State fiscal officer unless and until the Department of Civil Service certifies to such officer that the persons to be paid are holding their positions in accordance with Civil Service Laws and Rules.
Payment of an employee by a fiscal officer after the refusal of the Department to certify his/her employment constitutes a misdemeanor.
Certifications are issued by the Department of Civil Service on a biweekly basis covering new appointments and changes in employees' status.
Civil Service Law also requires that the Civil Service Department examine the payrolls of all departments, agencies and authorities at least annually, and authorizes the Department to conduct such an examination at any time.
EU nationals who visit Italy with the intention of finding a job should apply at the foreigners’ office (ufficio stranieri) at the local police headquarters for a permit (ricevuta di segnalazione di siggiorno) within eight days, which entitles them to remain in Italy for three months while looking for a job.
When you’ve found work, you take the ricevuta together with a letter from your employer confirming your employment to the police headquarters to obtain a permit to stay.
You must also apply for a work permit (permesso di lavoro, which is valid only for as long as you’re employed and is available to both residents and non-residents.
Work permits for non-EU nationals must be obtained outside Italy, where an application for work authorisation (autorizzazione al lavoro) must be made at your local Italian embassy.
The employment of non-EU nationals must be approved by the Italian labour authorities, who can propose the employment of an EU national in place of a foreigner (although this is rare).
Note that it’s impossible to convert a tourist visa into a work visa and therefore if you’re a non-EU national and need a visa to work in Italy, you must obtain it before your arrival in the country.
There’s nothing to stop you visiting Italy as a tourist in order to find a job, but you cannot work without going home and applying for a work visa (which can take months to obtain).
Under Italian law, a self-employed person must have an official status and it’s illegal to simply hang up a sign and start business.
People setting up in a self-employed capacity must provide evidence of their status, such as membership of a professional or trade body, a VAT number, or registration on a trade register.
EU nationals are entitled to work as a self-employed person (or an employee) without waiting for a residence permit to be issued.
This document is merely a means of proof and not a condition of your entitlement to live in the country.
If you’re an EU national and obtained a residence permit as an employee, this doesn’t prevent you from changing status during its period of validity and setting up in a self-employed capacity.
Frontier workers are defined as people working in Italy but residing outside the country and returning there at least once a week.
Frontier workers don’t require a permit to stay but must apply for a frontier worker’s card at the police headquarters nearest to their place of employment and produce evidence of their employment status and residence abroad.
Every worker has the right to form and join a trade union and to participate in the union’s activities;
Every worker has the right to strike
Every trade union, employers’ organization and employer has the right to engage in collective bargaining.
When gold and diamonds were discovered, mining activity in South Africa rapidly increased.
The booming mining industry brought with it an influx of labour and workers to the mines.
The first South African trade union was, the Carpenters’ and Joiners’ Union was established in 1881, largely to protect the interests of skilled foreign workers working on the mines.
As the mining industry developed, the difference in political power between whites and blacks became entrenched as trade unions, catering largely for white workers, mobilised increasingly on the basis of race.
In 1911, the Mines and Works Act was passed which reserved various types of work for white workers only.
This era was very turbulent and a number of strikes, with the aim of securing the position of white workers on the mines, took place.
After the general strike of 1914, martial law was declared and trade union leaders were deported from South Africa.
The “labour peace” which ensued was short lived as the circumstances of the mines worsened due to the economic depression, a large foreign debt and the rising costs of living.
The mines responded by restructuring.
This led to a number of white workers being retrenched, which in turn led to the abolition of the ratio between skilled white workers and unskilled black workers on the mines.
This situation gave rise to the 1922 strike, one of the watershed moments in South African labour history.
The result of this strike was the passing of the Industrial Conciliation Act in 1924.
This Act was the direct forefather of the Industrial Conciliation Act of 1956, which was later, renamed the Labour Relations Act of 1956.
In terms of this Act, trade unions representing white workers were accorded recognition, while a separate system for Black workers were created.
The Wiehahn Commission of Inquiry was established in 1979 to investigate the labour situation in South Africa.
The resultant report of the Commission went on to change the face of South African labour relations and labour law.
The most consequential recommendation made by the Commission was the extension of freedom of association to cover all persons, irrespective of race or sex.
The result was that trade unions representing Black workers were now able to make use of the machinery of the Labour Relations Act of 1956.
The period between 1991-1994 saw the birth of the new democratic South Africa.
In 1994, the Interim Constitution, Act 200 of 1993, came into effect.
The Act totally changed the constitutional basis of the South African legal system and it became clear that the Labour Relations Act of 1956 was not in line with the new constitutional order.
In 1994, the Department of Labour appointed a Ministerial Legal Task Team to draft new labour legislation and the Labour Relations Act 66 of 1995 was born and came into effect on 11 November 1996.
The Act heralded a new era in South African labour law.
The sources of South African labour law include:
Since the democratisation of South Africa after April 1994 the country’s labour law was amongst the first areas of law to be reformed.
The main employment law statutes of South Africa are the following:
The Unemployment Insurance Act 30 of 1996 (UIA) [NB: This law has been repealed and replaced by the Unemployment Insurance Act, 2001 ]
Unlike the law in certain other countries, collective agreements are normally legally enforceable as between employers and trade unions.
The Labour Relations Act 66 of 1995, (“the LRA”) supports the primacy of collective agreements and emphasises the need for organised labour and business to regulate its relationship through the entering into of collective agreements which binds the employer, the union’s members and, where the union represents more than 50% of the employees in a workplace and if such intent is stated, non-union members in the workplace.
The date of commencement of employment - this is important for the calculation of benefits such as leave, recognition of length of service and the benefits attached to it – e.g.
severance pay in a retrenchment.
The employee’s wage or the rate and method of calculating wages - This has undoubtedly been included for certainty, consistency and protection for the employee, in addition to ensuring that the employee is fairly remunerated for leave, for overtime, etc.
The overtime rate - Similar to above.
Any other payments in cash or kind to which the employee may be entitled (and for payments in kind, the value of those payments) - Again important for calculating the monetary value and benefits to which an employee would be entitled during leave, on termination (e.g.
severance pay on retrenchment is calculated at one week’s remuneration per completed year of service, not one week’s base salary.
Remuneration includes the value of a number of benefits.
The LRA expressly recognises the following grounds for termination of the employment contract:
The concept of unfair dismissal is a right created by statute and contained in the LRA.
Chapter VIII of the LRA, along with an accompanying code of practice, has made a large contribution to systematising and clarifying this important area of South African employment law.
Unfair dismissals now fall into four categories:
If an unfair dismissal claim succeeds the CCMA has a choice of remedies.
The commissioner may:
The primary remedy applied by the CCMA in respect of a dismissal which is substantively fair is to order reinstatement or re-employment.
In the event that the employee does not wish to be reinstated or re-employed or the circumstances are such that a continued employment would be either intolerable or no longer reasonably practical or the dismissal is unfair only because the employer did not follow a fair procedure, the commissioner may award compensation rather than reinstatement/re-employment.
There are certain limits on compensation.
In the case of an automatically unfair dismissal, the commissioner is enjoined to make an award which is “just and equitable” in all the circumstances, but not more than the equivalent of 24 months’ remuneration.
In an unfair dismissal the commissioner may award up to a maximum of 12 months’ remuneration as compensation.
This has serious ramifications for procedurally unfair dismissals.
In the past a commissioner/arbitrator may have decided to award a month or two’s compensation because of the minor nature of the employer’s lack of procedural compliance.
The Labour Courts are now faced with adopting an “all or nothing” approach and now have to award either 12 months or nothing to an employee who has been visited with a procedurally unfair dismissal.
In most instances, other than cases of trivial procedural deficiencies, this will result in 12 months compensation being awarded to the employee for procedural unfairness because of the inherent delays in having such matters heard.
Ordinary hours of work (i.e.
not overtime) may not be more than 45 hours in a week or 9 hours in a day.
For employees who work a 6-day week, it is 8 hours per day.
Any additional hours will be considered overtime for which a specified amount of additional remuneration is prescribed.
Overtime is limited to a total of 10 hours per week and then too, may not exceed 3 hours of overtime per day.
An agreement is necessary between the employer and the employee for overtime work.
Overtime work must be paid at no less than 1.5 times the normal hourly rate, or time off (equivalent to 1.5 times), or partially paid and partially paid time off.
The BCEA does recognize a certain amount of flexibility in arranging shifts and work times.
These are however also regulated – e.g.
a compressed working week can be implemented by means of a written agreement, to allow for 12 ordinary hours of work (including meals) to be done in a day.
It may however only be done in terms of a 5-day week, and with regard to the statutory daily rest periods.
Averaging of hours is also recognized by the BCEA, to enable more hours to be worked on a particular day and less on another provided it ‘averages’ out over a period of 4 months to the statutory weekly limit on ordinary and overtime hours of work per week.
Averaging can however only be done in terms of a collective agreement (i.e.
a written agreement concluded with a registered trade union), and must be subject to the daily and weekly rest periods.
Employees who perform night work enjoy special protection in terms of the BCEA.
Night work means work done between 6 o’clock in the evening and 6 o’clock the next morning.
An employer can only require an employee to do night work if there is an agreement with the employee (e.g.
in the contract of employment), the employee is paid an allowance (which may be a shift allowance) or receives a reduction in working hours, and if there is transport available between the employee’s home and the workplace.
There are a number of strict regulations around night work, including those contained in a code of good practice passed in terms of the BCEA, in ensuring the health and safety of employees who do night work.
Employees are entitled to maternity leave of no less than 4 months, which is to start from 4 weeks prior to due date of birth, and end not less than 6 weeks after birth of the child.
Maternity leave is classified as unpaid leave, unless otherwise agreed by the parties.
There are also strict provisions around the nature of work that a pregnant or nursing employee is not permitted to perform where it could be hazardous to her or the child’s health.
The purpose of the Employment Equity Act is to ensure workplace equity.
It prohibits unfair discrimination in the workplace and guarantees equal opportunity and fair treatment to all employees.
However, it recognises that, given the historical disparities, simply removing discrimination does not in itself result in substantive equality.
The Act therefore imposes an obligation on certain employers ("designated employers") to implement affirmative action measures to advance "designated groups" (African, Indian and Coloured people, women and people with disabilities).
the lack of role models from designated groups in senior positions in a corporation;
South African law does not prescribe minimum wages through statute.
Usually wages are fixed by the employer or by collective agreements or by the employee’s contract of employment.
The LRA sets out a procedure for the registration of trade unions and employer organisations.
It allows a union which is independent, has a distinctive name, an address in the Republic and which has adopted a constitution which meets the requirements of the law, to make application for registration.
Unions and employer’s organisations are not obliged to register, but registration is a precondition for participation in the industrial relation system developed by the Act.
The registrar of labour relations has the discretion to refuse an application to register a trade union, in terms of the Act.
However, this discretion is strictly controlled by the Act.
The LRA also allows a trade union to appeal the decision of the Registrar to the Labour court.
Chapter 2 of the LRA sets out basic labour rights.
Chief amongst these is freedom of association – the right of employees and employers to join and participate in the lawful activities of unions and employer organisations respectively.
The Constitution recognises the right to freedom of association, the right to form and join a trade union and the right to participate in trade union activities.
The LRA fosters and rewards representative unionism.
In other words, it promotes inter-union co-operation and union amalgamation.
Only unions that are sufficiently representative in a workplace are entitled to organisational rights.
Unions with majority membership are entitled to receive relevant information from the employer and to conclude collective agreements.
A collective agreement is a legally enforceable instrument and is negotiated by the parties usually concerns terms and conditions of employment or any other matter of mutual interest between the parties.
The only formality in respective of collective agreements is that it must be reduced to writing.
The agreements bind the parties to the agreement and their members.
The agreement can also be extended to bind non-union members if the party union has majority membership within the workplace.
Collective agreements will override the provisions of any inconsistent individual employment contracts and may also be concluded within bargaining councils and thus save as minimum wage and working conditions instruments.
Bargaining Councils have been established by the LRA and are by definition, statutory bodies that registered unions and employer organisations may voluntarily and co-operatively establish within a specific economic sector.
They represent the centre-piece of the system of bargaining fostered by the LRA.
Collective agreements are inclined to be time-bound, with a life span that is by and large determined by the parties’ bargaining cycles.
However, the agreement can be terminated on reasonable notice by either party.
The right to strike is entrenched in Section 23 of the Constitution.
Employers enjoy a reciprocal right to lockout, which is also constitutionally entrenched.
The LRA does regulate the right to strike and lockout.
The LRA defines a strike as a partial or complete concerted refusal to work or the retardation or obstruction of work by employees of the same employer for the purpose of remedying a grievance or resolving a dispute in respect of a matter of mutual interest.
A lockout is defined as an exclusion by the employer of the employees from the employer’s workplace for the purposes of compelling the employees to accept a demand in respect of any matter of mutual interest.
once the certificate has been obtained and/or the 30-day period has lapsed, the concerned party must then give the other party 48 hours notice of the strike or lockout.
The LRA extends strong protection to strikes and lockouts that comply with its provisions:
The affected party can approach the Labour Court for an interdict or order restraining a strike or lockout.
Section 65 (1) (d) of the LRA prohibits strikes and lockouts in essential services and maintenance services.
Instead employers and employees are obligated to refer their disputes to final and binding arbitration.
The Act defines an essential service as a service the interruption of which endangers the life, personal safety or health of the whole or any part of the nation, the parliamentary service and South African Police Services.
adjudicate disputes relating to freedom of association (union- and employer- organisation membership);

interpretation or application of lapsed collective agreements,
Labour Court judges are normally appointed from the ranks of specialist labour law practitioners (practising advocates or attorneys) and in some cases suitably qualified academics.
Labour Appeal Court judges must, in addition, be judges of the High Court of South Africa.
CCMA commissioners, unlike Labour Court judges do not have to have legal qualifications.
There are various levels of commissioners appointed and generally the more senior commissioners are either legally qualified or have experience in arbitrating disputes.
Commissioners are required to conciliate or arbitrate disputes.
Disputes are first conciliated and if they remain unresolved, referred to arbitration, normally before a different commissioner.
In the Labour and Labour Appeal Courts legal representation is not compulsory but most employers and many employees are usually represented.
In the CCMA legal representation is permitted, save for incapacity and misconduct cases where legal representation is in the discretion of the commissioner and must be on application by one or both parties.
Legal representation in such matters is not normally permitted unless there are complex issues of facts and law, conflicting arbitration awards or it is in the interests of public policy that legal representation be permitted.
Generally, at the CCMA if legal representation is sought it is preferable to apply for the appointment of a senior commissioner, which, if successful, will normally result in the parties being afforded legal representation.
There is no specific provision for class actions in our Labour Courts.
Often, however, matters are brought by representative trade unions for and on behalf of their members and without their members being specifically cited.
This form of representative action is permissible.
Damages and compensation granted are normally limited to 24 months (in respect of automatically unfair dismissals) and 12 months (in respect of unfair dismissals) and are not strictly linked to patrimonial loss.
The primary remedy in South African labour law, unlike England and other jurisdictions, is that of reinstatement/re-employment.
There is an increasing propensity by employees to avail themselves of their rights in terms of employment related legislation.
Historically, litigation relating to unfair dismissals was brought by trade unions and largely unskilled aggrieved employees.
Increasingly members of management (including senior management) have come to appreciate that South African employment legislation draws no distinction between senior managerial and lowly skilled employees and affords them the same rights and benefits.
This has resulted in a large number of plaintiff based labour lawyers and labour consultants seeking relief (sometimes on a contingency basis) on behalf of their clients.
Such relief is often based on the failure of employers to properly comply with the strict procedural requirements associated with dismissal in South Africa (to which reference will be made below) and to seek compensation in respect thereof.
Such claims for compensation often result in settlements being agreed between the parties, which may be in excess of any compensation that the employee may actually have suffered.

European Trade Union Confederation holds its Executive Committee meeting on 1 and 2 June in Brussels
The European trade unions will meet for the Executive Committee [ 1 ] of the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) in Brussels on 1 and 2 June.
They will debate a number of important current issues that affect European citizens.
The meeting comes just ahead of the meeting of the European social partners with the European Commission President.
A number of subjects will be on the agenda, including: the worsening of the crisis in Europe and its consequences, the state of play in terms of unemployment and the social crisis, the situation of the euro and financial regulation.
The Committee will also debate: revision of the Working Time Directive, public services, management and financing of climate policies and the simplification of legislation (Better Regulation).
The ETUC Executive Committee meeting will be followed, on 4 June, by a meeting of the European social partners with the President of the European Commission, Mr Barroso, to discuss the crucial question of the social dimension of the crisis.
[ 1 ] The Executive Committee meets four times a year.
It is composed of representatives from the affiliated organisations in proportion to their membership.
If necessary, decisions can be taken by a qualified two-thirds majority vote.
It is the Executive Committee which decides on the mandate and the composition of the delegations for negotiations with the European employers’ organisations in the European Social Dialogue, and which assesses the results.
The main inspiration of labour regulation is provided in the constitutional provisions.
Article 48 2) of the CAR emphasizes that the basic tasks of the State in the economic, social and cultural spheres is, first and foremost, to contribute to employment and the improvement of working conditions for the population.
The freedom to choose a profession is guaranteed, as well as the right to working conditions that are in compliance with safety and hygiene requirements (Art.
32 of the CAR).
Forced labour is prohibited.
The Labour Code of the Republic of Armenia (LC) was adopted on 9 November 2004.
It consists of three parts, 24 chapters and 266 articles.
The Labour Code deals with various aspects of collective and individual labour relations.
[1]
Article 83 of the LC defines the contract of employment as an agreement between an employee and an employer, according to which the employee undertakes to perform work of a certain profession, qualification or to perform specific duties in accordance with the work regulations established at the workplace.
The employer undertakes to provide the employee with the work specified in the contract of employment, to pay him/her the agreed wages and to ensure working conditions as set out in labour legislation of the Republic of Armenia, other legal acts, collective agreements and the agreement between the parties.
A contract of employment should not contain any condition less favourable to workers than those stipulated by labour law.
If a contract of employment contains such provisions, they are deemed invalid (Article 6 of the LC).
Chapter 15 of the LC (Articles 109 to 130) regulates in a detailed manner the termination of employment.
The employer is not entitled to dismiss an elected representative of the workers without prior consent of the labour inspector.
(Article 119 of the LC).
In case of collective dismissals, the employer has to inform the State Employment Service and the workers' representative three months in advance.
Redundancies are deemed collective if they concern, during the period of two consecutive months, the termination of employment for more than ten per cent of the whole number of workers, but not less than ten people (Article 116 of the LC).
A two-week severance allocation is paid under certain specific circumstances.
This amount may be increased by collective agreements (Article 129 of the LC).
The maximum duration, including overtime work carried out at the request of the employer, should never exceed 48 hours per week and 12 hours per day.
Overtime is strictly regulated, namely some limitations are introduced for young and disabled workers, workers with family responsibilities, or work in hazardous conditions (Article 144 of the LC).
Overtime should not exceed four hours during two consecutive working days and 120 hours per year (Article 146 of the LC).
Article 148 of the LC regulates night work.
This is defined as work performed between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Financial compensation instead of the annual paid leave is not authorized (Article 170 of the LC), exception made for the termination of employment.
Unpaid leave is allowed for the events listed in Article 176 of the LC, i.e.
three days are granted for a marriage or funeral of a family member.
Article 177 of the LC authorizes other types of leave, and their prolongation, and is provided by collective agreements or contracts of employment.
In Armenia, persons under the age of 16 are not permitted to engage in full time employment (Art.
32 of the CAR).
Article 178 of the LC grants equal pay for equal work for men and women.
Particular wage conditions are provided for overtime work or night work, work carried out in hazardous conditions, during public holidays and rest days, idle time and part-time work (Articles 183 to 189 of the LC).
Article 23 of the LC states that rights and interests of workers may be represented by trade unions.
In the Republic of Armenia, there are four levels of social partnership: State, branch, region and enterprise.
In the latter, the social partners are the employers and the trade union of the enterprise (Article 41 of the LC).
collective bargaining aimed at preparing and signing collective agreements; and
Among the fundamental principles of labour regulation in the Republic of Armenia, it is indicated that collective agreements cannot contain conditions, which are less favourable to workers than those rights stipulated by labour legislation.
If collective agreement contains such provisions, they are deemed invalid (Article 6 of the LC).
Articles 45 and 46 of the LC deals with the collective bargaining process, the regulation, preparation, conclusion and execution of collective agreements.
Collective agreements can be concluded at State, branch, regional and enterprise levels (Article 46 of the LC).
While the content and structure of collective agreements are to be decided by the parties concerned, Article 49 of the LC provides a detailed list of possible issues to be dealt with in State, branch and regional agreements.
These agreements should be submitted for registration to the relevant public body within ten days after their signature.
Refusal to register collective agreements is prohibited (Article 51 of the LC).
National, branch and regional collective agreements come into force on the date of their signature by the parties, unless otherwise stipulated in these agreements.
The validity of these agreements are determined by the parties, however this term cannot be longer than three years.
A possible extension of its validity is also limited to three years (Article 52 of the LC).
As regards collective agreements at the enterprise level, Chapter 10 (Articles 55 to 63) of the LC describes their content and process of elaboration.
The parties of the enterprise-level collective agreement are the employer and the trade union acting in the enterprise.
In the case of several trade unions present in the enterprise, they should constitute a single body to represent workers’ interests (Article 56 of the LC).
The content of an enterprise-level collective agreement is subject to the social partners’ consideration and negotiation, but should not contradict national legislation and higher-level collective agreements, or be less favourable to workers (Article 57 of the LC).
Enterprise-level collective agreements come into force on the date of their signature by the parties, or on the date stipulated.
The term is determined by the parties concerned, however, this term cannot be longer than three years.
A possible extension is also limited to three years (Article 52 of the LC).
The procedure for amending and supplementing an enterprise-level collective agreement should be established in the agreement itself (Article 60 of the LC).
As regards the possibility of unilateral termination of the enterprise-level collective agreement, Article 61 of the LC indicates that each party is allowed to do so after giving at least three-months’ notice to the other party.
However, resignation is forbidden during the first six months of the validity of the enterprise-level collective agreement.
[4]
Article 22 of the LC states that representation in collective labour relations is deemed effective if the representatives are mandated by the majority of workers.
The decisions taken through these representatives have binding effect on all the workers of the enterprise, even those who did not mandate such representation.
Chapter 24 of the LC details the settlement of labour disputes.
Individual disputes concerning contracts of employment are to be dealt with in the courts, following the procedure established by the Civil Procedure Code (Article 264 of the LC).
Collective labour disputes are regulated by Chapter 11 of the LC (Articles 64 to 82).
Article 64 of the LC defines collective labour disputes as disagreements between the trade union and the employer, or the parties allowed to conclude a collective agreement, on the submitted and unsatisfactory requirements of the parties, related to process or content of collective bargaining.
The submission of motivated requirements is done in writing to the relevant social partner who is expected to reply within seven days after its receipt (Articles 65 and 66 of the LC).
Conciliation is a mandatory stage in the collective labour disputes settlement procedure.
To this end, a conciliation commission consisting of an equal number of representatives of the parties to the dispute has to be established within seven days after the beginning of the dispute (Articles 68 to 70 of the LC).
The conciliation commission has seven days to consider the dispute.
The decision taken by the conciliation commission has binding force on the parties to the dispute.
The right to strike is a constitutional right in the Republic of Armenia.
The employees have the right to strike for the protection of their economic, social and employment interests, the procedure and limitations are prescribed by the law (Art.
32 of the CAR).
Article 73 of the LC defines “strike” as a temporary suspension of work by workers of one or several enterprises in the case of non-settlement of a collective labour dispute related to collective agreement (including refusal to bargain collectively, refusal to discuss within the conciliation commission, non-execution of the decision taken by the conciliation commission).
The right to declare a strike is vested in the trade union.
The decision is considered adopted if two-thirds of the enterprise workers approve it by secret ballot.
The employer must be a given at least seven days’ written notice on the intended date for beginning the strike.
(Article 74 of the LC).
Article 75 of the LC enumerates the limitations of the right to strike.
In particular, strikes are prohibited in police, armed forces, in electricity, water and gas supply enterprises, first aid medial services.
Strikes are temporarily forbidden in the event of a natural disaster, state of emergency or martial law.
It is important to point out in this context that the declaration of any strike is not allowed during the period of validity of the collective agreement.
The rights and duties of the parties to the collective labour dispute are specified in Articles 79 and 80 of the LC.
For instance, participation in a strike is voluntary, and the employer cannot consider the participation in a legal strike as a breach of labour discipline.
In Armenia, it does not exist a specialized labour court system and labour disputes are dealt with in the ordinary civil judiciary system.
Chapter 2: Labour relations, the grounds of the emergence of labour relations, the parties to labour relations
[3] As mentioned above, the Trade Unions Act of 2000 is a special law which deals with the organization and functioning of trade unions.
The draft law on employers’ organizations is under preparation in July 2006.
[4] In the event of privatization of the enterprise, its collective agreement is considered as unilaterally terminated on behalf of the former employer irrespective of the validity period.

The employer shall provide written notification to the other parties and the Labor Commissioner of the posting of the undertaking.

As the lead agency, the division shall request any state or local agency having statutory public health and safety jurisdiction over any part of the construction, maintenance, or operation of any such liquefied petroleum gas storage facility, other than a facility owned or maintained by a public utility, to exercise its statutory jurisdiction in relation to such facility, and shall report to the Legislature any instance in which such jurisdiction was not exercised.
176. (a) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that the Dymally-Alatorre Bilingual Services Act, Chapter 17.5 (commencing with Section 7290) of Division 7 of Title 1 of the Government Code, was enacted in 1973 to provide for the removal of language barriers that prevent the people of this state who are not proficient in English from effectively accessing government services and otherwise communicating with their government.
The Legislature further finds and declares that limited-English-proficient individuals will benefit from increased language-based access to the programs and services of the Division of Occupational Safety and Health.
The Legislature further finds and declares that federal statistics show that from 1996 to 2000, while overall worker fatalities dropped 14 percent, immigrant worker fatalities rose 17 percent.
Immigrant workers die on the job at higher rates because they frequently work in more dangerous industries with little or no training.
Language barriers compound the problem because training and warning signs are often only in English.
(b) As used in this section, a "public contact position" means any position responsible for responding to telephone or in-office inquiries or taking complaints from the general public regarding matters pertaining to occupational safety and health.
(c) As used in the section, an "investigative position" means any position responsible for investigating complaints, injuries, or deaths related to occupational safety and health.
(d) As used in this section, "limited-English-proficient" refers to persons who speak English less than "very well," in accordance with United States Census data.
(e) The division shall make all efforts to ensure that limited-English-proficient persons can communicate effectively with the division.
Examples of potential measures include, but are not limited to, the hiring of bilingual persons in public contact positions and investigative positions, the use of contract based interpreters, and the use of telephone-based interpretation services.
Nothing contained in this section relieves the division of its separate obligations under the Dymally-Alatorre Bilingual Services Act, Chapter 17.5 (commencing with Section 7290) of Division 7 of Title 1 of the Government Code, or any other state or federal laws requiring the provision of its services in languages other than English.
(f) On July 30, 2004, the Division of Occupational Safety and Health shall issue a progress report to the Legislature on the implementation of this section that shall, at a minimum, include all of the following: (1) The most recent information provided to the California State Personnel Board pursuant to Section 7299.4 of the Government Code.
(2) The number of bilingual employees in public contact and investigative positions in each local office of the division and the languages they speak, other than English.
(3) A description of any centralized system or other resources for providing translation and interpretation services within the division.
(4) A description of any quality control measures or evaluations undertaken by the division to evaluate whether limited-English-proficient persons are able to communicate effectively with the division.
(5) A description of any means, such as contracted interpreters, telephone-based interpretation services, or video conferencing, used by the division to communicate with individuals who are limited-English-proficient in the event that bilingual employees in public contact or investigative positions are not available, and the frequency in which these services were used by the division during the most recent fiscal year.
The main source of labour legislation in the Republic of Belarus is the Labour Code (Arts.
35 to 52), in force since the 1st January 2000 and as lastly amended in June 2006.
Article 7 of the Labour Code (LC) enumerates sources of labour law, such as the Constitution of Belarus, the Labour Code and other legal acts, collective agreements, and local normative acts concluded or issued in conformity with the legislation.
The Resolution of the Plenum of the Supreme Court of Belarus “On some issues of application by the courts of labour legislation” dated 21 March 2001, clarifies application of the Labour Code to termination of employment contract.
Termination of employment relations is possible, according to the Labour Code (Art.
35), on the following basic grounds:
Expiration of the period for which employment contract was concluded is another ground for terminating an employment contract, except in the cases where employment contract continues de facto and neither party demands that employment relations be terminated (paragraph 2, Article 35 of the Labour Code).
This ground for termination of employment contract can be raised in relation to all contracts concluded for definite period, according to the Resolution of the Plenum of the Supreme Court of Belarus “On some issues of application by the courts of labour legislation”, dated 21 March 2001.
The transfer of employee to another employeror taking by employee of electiveoffice leads to termination of existing employment contract and is only possible with prior consent of employee which should be given in writing.
Nomination to elective office may also lead to termination of employment relations.
Such nomination should be proved by documentary evidence.
Refusal of employee to be transferred to another locality with employer.
The Labour Code stipulates as a ground to terminate an employment contract, for instance, the refusal from continuation of work because of significant changes of work conditions, as well as refusal to continue work because of change of the ownership, or because of reorganization (merger, annexation, changing of legal form).
Termination of employment contract with prior probation period.
An employer can dismiss an employee according to this ground, only in the case of unsatisfactory probation period.
The employer must justify why the employee did not meet expectations.
If the justification given is unsatisfactory, such termination may be challenged in court.
Termination of employment relations irrespective of parties' will constitutes another group of grounds for termination of employment contract.
The reason for such termination is usually an initiative of the third parties or emergence of objective obstacles which prevent continuation of employment relations.
Entering into force of court sentence means that the employee concerned cannot continue his or her work (paragraph 5 of Article 44 of the Labour Code).Death of employee or declaring him or her by the court as deceased or missing also leads to termination of employment relations.
Basically, labour legislation provides a number of limitations for termination of employment contract on the initiative of employer.
These limitations can be divided into two groups.
The first group contains prohibition for termination of employment contract within a certain period of time or applicable to a particular category of employees.
Limitations of this group include, inter alia, the norms, which prohibit dismissal during periods of temporary inability to work, during leave, pregnancy, etc.
The second limitation includes those prescribing to follow certain procedures and meet certain requirements for termination of employment relations.
This group includes obligation of employer to notify competent body (trade union, commission on minors), requirement to take measures to transfer employee to another work and some other requirements.
The exhaustive list of grounds for termination of employment contract according to initiative of employer can be found in Article 42 of the Labour Code.
The Labour Code emphasizes that no other grounds for dismissal of an employee can be raised by an employer.
Non-fulfilment by employee of his or her work duties according to employment contract or rules of work without good reason, if the employee has previously been a subject of disciplinary sanction, (paragraph 4 of Article 42 of the Labour Code) is another ground of termination of employment contract.
Theft of employer's property, which is established by a court sentence, or administrative sanction by a competent body.
This ground for termination of employment contract is a disciplinary sanction and therefore should be applied in the order provided by paragraph 8 of Article 42 of the Labour Code.
Except for the grounds mentioned above, Article 47 of the Labour Code establishes a number of other grounds for termination of employment contract.
These include the following:
The legislation does not provide for the obligation of the employer or employee to give a notice on the intention to terminate the employment contract on the expiration of its term.
However, this rule can be included in a collective agreement, accord of the employment contract itself.
In these cases, the notice will be obligatory.
As regards contracts concluded for both limited or indefinite duration, the employee has to notify the employer at least one month in advance about his/her desire to termination employment relationship (Art.
40 LC).
All the dismissals under Art.
42 of the Labour Code, exception made for Para.
7 (appearance at work under the influence of alcohol or drugs), are possible, provided that the trade union concerned is informed two weeks before the expected dismissal (Art.
46 LC).
Procedural safeguards related to termination of employment depend upon whether or not the termination was a disciplinary sanction.
There is a special procedure for dismissal as a disciplinary sanction, which can be a result of non-fulfilment by employee of his or her working duties, absence from work for three hours or more without good reason, appearance at work under the influence of alcohol or drugs and other events stipulated by the Labour Code.
Prior to application of disciplinary sanction, an employer should request written explanation from employee.
Refusal of employee to provide explanation does not prevent application of sanction but should be formalized by means of a special written act mentioning witnesses.
Each disciplinary offence can only be followed by one disciplinary sanction.
The employer’s order on application of disciplinary sanction with justification must be presented to the employee against his or her signature within a period of five days.
If employee was not introduced to the order on disciplinary sanction, he or she is considered as not having disciplinary liability.
Chapter 23 of the Labour Code deals with legal status of employees, whose employment contracts are concluded for a period of less than two months, and for those who temporarily replace an absent employee for a period of up to four months.
Provision regarding short-term character of labour should be included in the employment contract.
A trial period cannot be introduced for short-term employees, and employees have additional right to terminate employment contract, providing a written notice to the employer three days in advance.
According to Article 48 of the Labour Code, the employee is entitled to severance pay, the amount of which depends upon the motive for termination of employment contract.
Employment contract terminated because of breach of legislation by employer or a collective agreement.
The amount of severance pay can be increased taking into account the length of service or other grounds provided by the collective agreement.
Termination of the employment contract can be redressed by using the procedure for settling individual labour disputes.
An individual labour dispute is a dispute (disagreement) between employee and employer with regard to application of legislation or other normative acts, collective agreement and other agreements regulating labour relations.
Such disputes should be considered by Commissions on Labour Disputes (CLD) and by the courts.
CLD is a mandatory primary body for consideration of labour disputes, with exception of the cases prescribed by the legislation.
CLDs are created in organizations based on equal representation of trade unions and employers for a period of one year.
The employee has the right to apply to CLD within three months after he or she became aware, or was supposed to become aware of violation of his or her right.
If three months have expired, and the employee did not apply to CLD, although there were valid reasons for not doing so, CLD may consider the dispute, if the reasons were, in the opinion of CLD, acceptable.
Even if CLD refuses to consider the dispute, the employee may still address the court for consideration of the dispute.
CLD is obliged to consider the dispute within ten days of receipt of the application.
There are no special labour courts in Belarus.
Disputes on labour law issues are considered by the courts of general jurisdiction.
The courts consider labour disputes in accordance with the rules established by the Code of Civil Procedure with some minor deviations, mentioned in the Labour Code.

Maternity leave is now covered and protected in the labour/employment standards legislation of every Canadian jurisdiction, and in most collective agreements.
It is designed to give expectant mothers the possibility of withdrawing from work in the later stages of their pregnancy and to allow them some time to recuperate after childbirth.
Maternity leave clauses represent one of the key practices with respect to work and family balance.
Although they sometimes only reiterate basic legislated guarantees, maternity leave provisions in collective agreements often provide additional benefits.
Typically, they indicate: the number of weeks (possibly including extensions) of leave of absence that can be taken and under what conditions; which employment benefits will be continued; how seniority will be calculated; and the procedure upon return to work.
More generous agreements also provide income-replacement mechanisms to supplement employment insurance benefits and may include additional safeguards to ensure the employment of pregnant employees and new mothers is adequately protected.
In some cases, collective agreements simply affirm that the parties will adhere to minimum standards regarding maternity leave, as found in the appropriate federal or provincial/territorial labour legislation.
Although this can be seen as merely the symbolic recognition of an existing right, adding such a clause in a collective agreement usually has the advantage, for unions, of making the issue subject to the grievance procedure.
This can thus provide employees with a more expedient redress mechanism should management not adhere to legislative requirements, while also allowing a uniform application within a group.
Below are some examples of contract language making reference to legislated standards.
An interesting clause, in forbidding discriminatory treatment, allows a pregnant employee to refuse a leave of absence or a change in her job duties and working conditions.
To be eligible for maternity leave, female employees must usually meet a number of requirements.
Generally, they must provide advance notice in writing of the expected start date of their leave.
This is in order to limit disruptions to the operations of an organization by giving an employer the opportunity to make arrangements to cover the absence of the employee.
Some collective agreements nonetheless make it possible to waive this obligation where circumstances warrant.
A number of collective agreements also delimit a more or less strict time period within which a maternity leave must start and end.
As some of the examples below illustrate, the boundaries are often determined by the length of the leave, and may mirror legislated standards.
With the exception of the Yukon, all Canadian jurisdictions have established limits concerning the start date of a maternity leave.
Usually, labour standards legislation stipulates that a maternity leave is not to commence earlier than a given number of weeks before the expected date of birth.
This number can range from 11 to 17 weeks, the latter representing the maximum length of a standard maternity leave in most jurisdictions.
Even though the starting date of the leave may be preset in a collective agreement, additional clauses are sometimes negotiated to offer a measure of flexibility in dealing with individual cases.
Conversely, the establishment of a fixed start and end date can be designed as an alternative solution should no agreement be reached between an employee and her employer.
While some collective agreements merely adhere to minimum labour standards, many others provide a longer period of leave, as shown in the following chart.
Extensions to maternity leave are provided in the labour standards legislation of most Canadian provinces and territories.
Seven jurisdictions guarantee at least six weeks of postnatal leave 6 .
Although unconditional in Alberta and British Columbia, this minimum period of leave in Ontario and Newfoundland legislation applies only to employees who are not taking parental leave.
In the case of Prince Edward Island and Saskatchewan, only employees giving birth later than the expected date of delivery are eligible.
As regards the Yukon, the six-week minimum period pertains solely to employees with pregnancy-related health problems.
Besides the above jurisdictions, Nova Scotia provides a minimum of one week of leave after childbirth.
(d)(1) An employee on maternity leave or parental leave shall not be entitled to sick leave during the period of leave.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1), an employee on maternity leave or parental leave who pursuant to paragraph (b)(5) and who subsequently suffers any illness or disability which prevents them from returning to work as scheduled, whether or not such illness or disability is related to pregnancy, shall be entitled to sick leave benefits commencing on the first day on which the employee would otherwise have returned to work.
The most common income-replacement mechanisms appearing in collective agreements are supplementary unemployment benefit (SUB) plans.
These essentially provide an employer-paid subsidy to top up Employment Insurance (EI) maternity benefits.
Sometimes, employees not eligible for EI benefits may also receive an allowance during their leave of absence.
a) ...for the first two (2) weeks an employee shall receive her weekly rate of pay; b) for up to a maximum of fifteen (15) additional weeks, payments equivalent to the difference between the Unemployment Insurance benefits the employee is eligible to receive and her weekly rate of pay; c) all other time as may be provided under this Article shall be on a leave without pay basis...
i) for each of the two (2) weeks of the waiting period required under the unemployment insurance plan, an allowance in the amount of 95% of her basic weekly rate of pay;
ii) for each of the fifteen (15) weeks for which she receives unemployment insurance benefits, a top-up allowance equal to the difference between 95% of her basic weekly rate of pay and the unemployment insurance benefits that she is receiving or is entitled to receive;
As can be seen in the previous examples, a number of collective agreements also stipulate that the employer will provide employees on maternity leave with an allowance to offset the two-week waiting period for EI benefits.
Such a provision is usually included as part of a more comprehensive SUB plan, but it may be a stand-alone clause.
Notice, in the last example below, that part of the benefit is paid upon return to work.
This might have been designed as an incentive to encourage pregnant employees to resume their employment.
During the first two (2) weeks of maternity leave an employee shall receive a supplementary employee benefit (SUB) based on ninety-five (95) percent of the weekly wage rate up to the UIC max subject to approval of the Unemployment Insurance Commission.
A full-time or part-time employee who is not entitled to unemployment insurance but who has accumulated twenty weeks of service shall also be entitled to receive the maternity allowance, but for a period of ten (10) weeks.

Both seniority retention/accrual and the preservation of benefits for employees on maternity leave are important issues to be addressed in the context of collective bargaining.
An important issue for many employees is what will happen to their seniority ranking should they take a relatively lengthy leave of absence.
This can be of particular concern to women, who tend on average to interrupt their employment more often and for longer periods than men, because of childbirth and the preponderant role they have traditionally played in the care of children.
Seniority can have a significant impact on an employee’s job security and working conditions - for example, in terms of shift selection, access to training, promotions—especially in industries subject to cyclical variations in workforce levels.
Although the issue of seniority is addressed in the labour legislation of a majority of jurisdictions, it still remains a consequential bargaining issue.
Legislative Provisions Regarding Seniority Protection and Accrual
Labour standards legislation in four jurisdictions stipulates that an employee’s seniority is to accrue during a maternity, parental or adoption leave: federal, Ontario, Saskatchewan and New Brunswick 11 .
Four other jurisdictions - Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, Nunavut and the Northwest Territories - allow employees to maintain their previous seniority when they return to work 12 .
The chart below shows the evolution of the frequency of seniority retention and accrual clauses in major collective agreements.
Note that although a majority of agreements in 1998 still did not include any provision on seniority leave and maternity, there is a small but noticeable shift from provisions providing only seniority retention to those that offer at least partial seniority accumulation, which would tend to be preferable for employees on leave.
From the perspective of employees taking a maternity or parental leave, the better provisions are those affording a continued accumulation of seniority and length of service during the leave.
Nonetheless, as the first example illustrates, a number of agreements simply allow seniority to be retained, rather than accrued.
Labour standards legislation in several Canadian jurisdictions allows employees to maintain a number of benefits - normally including pension, life insurance, accidental death, medical and dental plans - during their maternity (and parental) leave, although this is usually contingent on the payment of their share of premiums.
Such is the case in British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec and Saskatchewan, as well as for employees covered by the Canada Labour Code (federal jurisdiction).
Furthermore, vacation entitlements continue to accrue in British Columbia and, in Quebec, a reduction in annual vacation due to a maternity leave must be compensated by an indemnity.
In Nova Scotia’s Labour Standards Code, an employee may maintain benefit plans in which she participated prior to her leave as long as she enters an arrangement with the employer to pay both the employer’s and the employee’s cost 13 .
Maternity and parental leave clauses in collective agreements often deal with the issue of benefits.
Although some specify that employees on maternity leave are no longer eligible for certain benefits, a number of others offer more generous conditions.
The period of such leave shall be considered as Company service for seniority and pension purposes and vacation entitlement (but not vacation pay) only.
Although these are not benefits per se, employees on maternity or parental leave may wish to be informed about work-related opportunities, such as vacancies, promotions and training opportunities.
Indeed, this is a right guaranteed in the labour standards legislation of some Canadian jurisdictions.
A number of clauses in collective agreements stipulate that employees on leave are to be notified about opportunities in their workplace.
Every Canadian jurisdiction requires employers to reinstate employees who have taken a maternity leave to their former position or to a comparable one with equivalent wages and benefits.
In the latter case, federal jurisdiction employers must in addition offer a position in the same location.
Employees covered by Quebec’s Act Respecting Labour Standards must be reinstated in the same position at the end of their maternity leave or of a parental leave not exceeding 12 weeks.
They may be reassigned to a comparable position after a parental leave of greater than 12 weeks' duration.
In British Columbia, Nunavut, the Northwest Territories, the Yukon, Ontario, Prince Edward Island and Quebec, employees are to receive any wage rate or benefit increases to which they would have been entitled had they remained at work during the leave period.
Moreover, eight jurisdictions (Alberta, British Columbia, the Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Nova Scotia, Ontario, the Yukon) provide that if an employer suspends or discontinues operations during an employee’s maternity leave, the employee is to be reinstated upon resumption of operations.
In Alberta, this requirement only extends for 12 months after the end of the leave.
In Nova Scotia, Ontario and the Yukon, reinstatement is to proceed in accordance with the existing seniority system or practice.
Most collective agreements with maternity and/or parental leave clauses have contract language that basically reflects legislative requirements.
Agreements may specify that, where a position has been abolished or changed following a reorganization, an employee will be able to exercise her seniority to displace a junior employee.
However, this may not always be very beneficial for employees returning from a maternity leave, who generally tend to be younger and, consequently, to have relatively few years of service.
Some collective agreements provide additional protection against layoffs for employees on maternity (or adoption/parental) leave.
In at least one instance, these employees have a form of "super-seniority," giving them more job protection than more senior employees.
No employee can be laid off while on leave under these Clauses (...) However, this shall not prevent the Company from laying off active employees who are senior to him/her during his/her leave of absence under this Clause.
When the employee takes partial leave without pay under this clause, she or he shall work a minimum of fourteen (14) hours a week and the employee’s choice of work schedule shall be approved by the employer.
The employer shall consider any family obligations indicated by the employee where applicable.
[translation]
Although rather rare, some clauses in collective agreements deal with the issue of interrupted pregnancies, both voluntary and involuntary.
Two types of provisions have been identified: those pertaining to miscarriages (sometimes including abortions) and those regarding stillbirths.

This publication has been prepared with the precise objective of supporting trade union training activities directed both to negotiate and participate in the management of vocational training strategies, in particular within the working places.
It deals with aspects regarding the historical definition and evolution of the vocational training concept, the main training variables liable to be found in an heterogeneous entrepreneurial world, the basic features of collective bargaining with respect to training, as well as different alternatives and tools for trade union participation in the management of training plans and strategies.
The evolution of the concept of vocational training in international labour standards
A substantial part of wage earners, classified from middle to upper, are located in this sector of "lead enterprises".
Without these wage earners the trade union movement would have no strength because those wage earners are located in the strategic sectors of the economy.
In this sector of lead enterprises the trade union movement is obliged to submit proposals when faced with the changes that occur in the labour relations system due to entrepreneurial strategies regarding productivity, competitiveness, quality and flexibility.
At an earlier time, labour relations stemmed from great concentrations of workers by branch of activity and their insertion in the local market.
Because of this, agreements between employers and trade unions had a direct effect on whole branches of the national economy and on the expansion of consumption.
At present, the new definition of competitive enterprises atomises the work force, weakening the homogeneous paths followed by workers both in the different branches and at the national level.
At the same time, the organisation of labour changes in work centres and brings into play ever increasingly differentiated specific union claims in the enterprise.
Therefore, the predominance of wage earners who are organised by branch of activity is replaced by representations of groups of wage earners of a lesser number but whose claims lie specifically within the enterprises.
For this reason, the collective bargaining agreement at a "lead" level is diluted when faced with the problems of the enterprise and gives way, in practice as well as in theory, to articulated collective bargaining modes of behaviour.
In the present circumstances, trade unions must consider the set of basic instruments (training, participation, payment system and ergonomics) as a whole and must understand that the four instruments can serve to increase productivity at the cost of a greater exploitation of workers, or increase productivity by improving pay and working conditions.
The concept of productivity is the scenario that is common to both the capitalist option, based on obtaining profits and the subjection of the workers to capital and on the other hand according to the standards of industrial democracy and the democratisation of labour.
For the trade union, therefore, what must firstly be clear is that the objective of productivity is not automatically the same as the trade union objective which is to improve living and working conditions.
This is where the bargaining space between enterprises and trade unions is located.
By way of conclusion: the meaning of socio-political trade unionism
62 p. (Trade unions and training, 1)
Vocational training is today a focal point of labour relations systems and, in more general terms, of all that refers to the world of work.
Ever more clearly and distinctly it is closely related to subjects such as employment, wages, health and security on the job, social security and labour mobility, to name only a few of the topics that are traditionally discussed when labour issues are addressed.
The increasing importance of training in the world of labour has led trade unions, in fulfilment of their duty to represent and defend the interests and aspirations of workers, to assign a new and larger space to training on their agendas, both in terms of discussion and action.
It can be shown that both the quantity and the quality and relevance of trade union participation in instances of decision-making and management of training -which instances may be national, regional or local in scope, of a sectorial nature or at the level of individual enterprises or clusters of enterprises- has increased considerably during the nineties and first years of this 21st century that is only just beginning.
The series Trade unions and training, that Cinterfor/ILO is initiating hereby, is designed to present contributions, experiences and reflections focusing on the subject of vocational training that may be of specific use as reference material and inputs for union movement action in this field.
One could say that it has a double objective: it can become a material for both support and reference for union modus operandi, and a means to approach and divulge the workers' vision on vocational training themes to the public interested in the matter.
In this the first publication of this series, Alvaro Orsatti examines and summarises the positioning of the Latin American trade union movement (stressing the national cases of Argentina and Brazil) and of the ILO (basically represented herein by Cinterfor/ILO contributions) regarding the relationship between vocational training and workers education.
After presenting separately the views of these organizations on the articulation between both types of training, the author makes an effort to find what points they have in common, in what would be an integrated approach to the nexuses and interconnections between vocational training and workers education.

Grade and Pay Retention and Severance Pay Eligibility for Veterans Readjustment Appointees
Q - Is an employee holding a Veterans Readjustment Appointment (VRA) eligible for grade or pay retention upon reduction in grade or pay, or to severance pay upon involuntary separation (not for cause)?
A - Employees holding VRAs are not eligible for grade or pay retention upon reduction in grade or pay, or to severance pay upon involuntary separation (not for cause).
Similarly, the severance pay law does not apply to an employee serving under an appointment with a definite time limitation, unless the time-limited appointment is made effective within 3 calendar days after separation from a qualifying appointment without time limitation.
(See the definition of employee in 5 U.S.C.
5595(a)(2)(ii) and the definition of non-qualifying appointment in 5 CFR 550.703.
)
Under 5 CFR part 307, a VRA is limited to 2 years.
Although employees are entitled to convert to a career or career-conditional appointment upon completion of the 2 years, this conversion right is contingent upon meeting the terms of the VRA--i.e., employees must satisfactorily complete (1) 2 years of substantially continuous service and (2) any education and training required under the VRA program.
If employees do not complete these requirements, they are not converted to career or a career-conditional appointment, and their VRA ends.
Therefore, for the purposes of grade and pay retention and severance pay, the VRA must be viewed as having a definite 2-year limitation.
Because the VRA is time-limited, employees holding such appointments are not eligible for grade and pay retention or severance pay.
information on Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards or other published material on safety for the work situation.
Information on how the agency will determine whether the hazard is reduced to a less than significant level;
A - Yes, because an employee is in a pay status during overtime hours.
However, the hazardous duty pay is computed on the employee's hourly rate of basic pay, not his or her hourly overtime rate.
(5 CFR 550.905 and 5 U.S.C.
5545(d)(2))
A - 5 U.S.C.
5545(c)(1) & (2) authorize the payment of annual premium pay for regularly scheduled standby duty and administratively uncontrollable overtime work, and 5 U.S.C.
5545a(c) authorizes availability pay, instead of some other types of premium pay, including hazardous duty pay.
Thus, hazardous duty pay may not be paid for hours of work for which an employee is paid these types of premium pay.
A - Employees generally are not entitled to holiday premium pay for the time they spend in work-related travel during holiday hours of their tours of duty.
Holiday premium pay is paid only to employees who perform work on a holiday.
(See 5 U.S.C.
5546(b).) The Comptroller General has ruled that the criteria in 5 U.S.C.
5542(b)(2) must be used to determine whether travel time is hours of work for holiday premium pay purposes.
(These are the same criteria that are used to determine travel time as hours of work for title 5 overtime pay purposes.
The criteria are also found in 5 CFR 550.112(g).
) Time spent in a travel status is not hours of work for the purpose of paying premium pay, including holiday premium pay, unless it meets one of the criteria in 5 U.S.C.
5542(b)(2)(B) for crediting irregular or occasional hours of work for travel.
The criteria state that time spent in a travel status away from the official duty station is not hours of employment unless the travel--
(See Comptroller General opinions B-82637, March 28, 1949; B-168726, January 28, 1970; and 50 Comp.
Gen. 519 (1971).
) Note that this guidance applies to both Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) exempt and nonexempt employees.
The provisions on travel time as hours of work for FLSA overtime pay purposes under 5 CFR 551.422 do not apply to the payment of holiday premium pay.
Although most employees do not receive holiday premium pay for time spent traveling on a holiday, they continue to be entitled to pay for the holiday in the same manner as if the travel were not required.
Severance Pay: Effect of Reemployment by the U.S. Postal Service (PQA 97-1, August 19, 1997)
Q - If a separated employee is receiving severance pay under 5 U.S.C.
5595 and is reemployed by the Postal Service, is there any effect on his or her severance pay?
A - Yes.
By law, severance payments must be discontinued when the recipient is "reemployed by the Government of the United States.
" (See 5 U.S.C.
5595(d).) The U.S. Postal Service is part of the U.S. Government. The fact that Postal Service employees are not entitled to receive severance pay under section 5595 (due to the exclusion at 5 U.S.C.
2105(e)) is irrelevant.
(We note that past Postal Service employment is creditable service for purposes of computing an employee's severance pay fund.
See 5 CFR 550.708(b).
)
A - Under current severance pay regulations (5 CFR 550.706), employees who resign because they expect to be involuntarily separated are considered to have been involuntarily separated for severance pay purposes ONLY IF they resign after receiving-
However, if the specific or general notice is cancelled before the resignation is effected, the resignation would not be qualifying for severance pay purposes.
(See 5 CFR 550.706(c).
A Certification of Expected Separation under 5 CFR 351.807 is not a qualifying specific or general notice under the severance pay regulations.
Even if a resignation is considered an "involuntary separation" under the severance pay rules, the employee may not be eligible for severance pay under 5 U.S.C.
5595 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart G, for other reasons.
The employee must meet all applicable eligibility requirements.
Severance Pay: Separation for Medical Inability to Perform Duties (PQA 98-2, July 23, 1998)
Q - Does an employee who has been removed for medical inability to perform his or her duties have an entitlement to severance pay?
A - The applicable statute authorizes severance pay for employees who are "involuntarily separated from the service, not by removal for cause on charges of misconduct, delinquency, or inefficiency.
" (See 5 U.S.S.
5595(b).) A medical inability to perform one's duties is neither "misconduct" nor "delinquency;" therefore, the precise question is whether removal for such inability constitutes "inefficiency" for severance pay purposes.
The legislative history of the severance pay statute suggests at least two guidelines for interpreting its provisions.
First, severance pay is intended to help individuals who lose their Federal jobs through no fault of their own.
Second, severance pay benefits should be construed liberally in favor of the employee.
Accordingly, an employee who is removed for inability to perform his or her duties may receive severance pay if the inability is caused by a medical condition that is beyond the employee's control.
This determination should be made by the employing agency based on acceptable medical documentation provided by the employee.
Q - If an employee receives a time-limited appointment that is qualifying for severance pay (i.e., effected within 3 days after separation from a qualifying permanent appointment), who is responsible for making severance payments--the agency at which the employee had a permanent appointment or the agency at which the employee had the time-limited appointment?
A - Severance pay liability rests with the agency employing the employee at the time of the involuntary separation that triggers the severance pay entitlement.
In the scenario set forth in the question, the agency employing the employee in the time-limited job will be responsible for making severance payments when the time-limited appointment ends.
Any severance pay entitlement that an employee may have based on an involuntary separation from a permanent appointment is immediately terminated (not suspended) when the employee receives a qualifying temporary appointment.
(See 5 CFR 550.711.
) Severance pay for an employee in a qualifying temporary appointment is triggered by the involuntary separation from that appointment (including expiration of the appointment as provided in the definition of "involuntary separation" in 5 CFR 550.703) and is computed using the rate of basic pay at the time of separation from that temporary job.
(See 5 CFR 550.709(b).
) Thus, the agency employing the individual in a time-limited job is liable for any severance payments.
In contrast, if a temporary appointment is not qualifying for severance pay because the employee is hired 4 or more days after involuntary separation from a qualifying permanent appointment, the severance pay liability rests with the agency in which the employee had a permanent appointment.
Severance payments by that agency are merely suspended during the temporary appointment.
ACAS has produced a revised Code of Practice on Time Off for Trade Union Duties And Activities.
This replaces the old Code of Practice of 2003 and updates the Code to take into account, for example, the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006.
The Code comes into effect on 1st January and includes guidance on time off for union learning representatives.
Sarah blogged yesterday on the increasing number of strikes (read her post here ).
If you are an employer facing strike action or want to prevent disputes escalating to industrial action you may be interested in a one day conference being run by the IRS on 15 October 2009 ‘Working with Trade Unions’.
The conference is billed as providing advice on managing trade union recognition and de-recognition, managing disputes, individual rights of union members and how to arrange ballots, individual and collective consultation and case studies demonstrating how to build good employee relations.
An interesting side product of the recession is highlighted in figures released today by UNISON (the largest public sector trade union).
These show that between January and June there has been a surge in the number of young people joining UNISON.
The reasons given for joining include being fearful of their future, feeling vulnerable at work and not sure of employment rights and also financial insecurity, ageism, bullying, stress and fears about the BNP (!
)
Unison have issued a press release today stating that more than 1,000 UNISON and Unite members employed by British Waterways have rejected proposals for a pay freeze.
This may be of particular interest to any employers considering alternatives to redundancies.
UNISON argue that a pay freeze is essentially a pay cut given the rise in living costs.
We suspect the proposals may also be a hard pill to swallow for union members given that the 2007/8 annual report revealed that the Chief Executive and eight directors enjoyed a lucrative salary and benefits packages and shared bonuses of more than £310,000!
Employers who recognise Trade Unions will often have collective agreements with the Trade Union which cover employees in the bargaining unit.
The case reported here answers some old chestnuts that crop up from time to time:
1.
A collective agreement is an agreement between a Trade Union and an employer, provisions within that collective agreement cannot be directly enforced by an employee as he was not a party to the agreement, unless the agreement was incorporated into the employee’s contract of employment.
2.
Where an individual employee’s contract conflicts with a collective agreement, in this case over a weekend working allowance, then the contract normally trumps the collective agreement as the contract is a bespoke document for the individual employee whereas a collective agreement is a generic document which covers a group of employees, of which the individual employee may be a part.
The judgements by the European Court of Justice (ECJ), notably in the Laval, Viking, Rüffert and Luxembourg cases, as well as the conflict at the Lindsey oil refinery in the United Kingdom at the end of January 2009, are evidence that worker mobility is a major issue for the future of the European Union (EU).
The rules governing labour law need to take into account the fact that we are facing a labour market that is becoming increasingly Europeanised.
At a time when worker mobility is increasing across the EU27, the directive concerning the posting of workers is playing an essential role in terms of fair competition, respect for workers’ rights, labour law and industrial relations systems in Europe.
The European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) supports worker mobility and takes the view that greater openness in the employment market in Europe demands a strict and fair structure within which workers occupy a central place.
For this reason, ETUC is calling for a review of Council Directive 96/71/EC concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services.
Erdoğan also suggested giving employees the right to strike like before 1980.
However, the civil servants’ union immediately protested, claiming the proposed changes would impact the job security of civil servants.
During negotiations with the EU, the Turkish government had pledged to introduce new regulations on the rights of civil servants to job security by 2013.
The EU wants job security to be removed, like in EU member countries, on the grounds that job security conflicts with the free market mechanism.
According to current laws, while workers who are given civil servant status have “job security,” which prevents them from being dismissed, workers without that status are granted certain rights but can be dismissed.
However, civil servants do not have the right to collective bargaining or strikes, while workers do.
If the referendum on Sept. 12 is in the affirmative, the right to “collective consultative talks,” which are not binding will be changed to the right to “collective bargaining.”
The bill, which closely concerns approximately 1.7 million civil servants comprising 62 percent of all public employees, allows talented and qualified people in the public sector to be moved to senior-level positions so as to improve the performance of public administration.
The term “public service” in the law, which prevents experts in the private sector from working in the public sector, is being changed.
The bill also foresees allowing women employees to take unpaid maternity leave for up to 24 months after birth to care for the child.
In cases where the mother can not use this, fathers who are public employees will be granted the right to take unpaid leave for up to 24 months as well.
Under the current laws, male civil servants are only allowed three days paid paternity leave.
If the bill passes, this will increase to 10 days.
The law on child support, which is limited to two children, will become permanent with the bill.
The bill requires employers to give up to three months of unpaid leave to public employees to take care of someone he is responsible for their next of kin if they have been in a serious accident or suffers a serious illness and whose life will be in danger if the employee does not attend to him.
After the changes to the Civil Servants Law, the government will start implementing the remaining parts of the reform in early 2011.
Additionally, ever since it came to power in 2003, the AK Party has wanted senior-level bureaucrats to come and go with the ruling party, like in Western countries.
The ETUC has an strong record in helping atypical workers such as part-timers and those on temporary contracts.
Unions do not only defend the interests of regular workers, but want to reach out to domestic workers and help them to organise.
Domestic workers should be recognised for what they do, and not be treated with disrespect, as is too often the case.
By joining a union, domestic workers can collectively demand decent living and working conditions.
In April 2005, the ETUC organised an international conference: “Out of the Shadows: “organising and protecting domestic workers in Europe: the role of trade unions ” , which addressed the growing interdependence between the formal and informal economy - and those performing formal or informal work - and the challenges that arise from this for trade unions.
The Conference also focused on the need to develop innovative ways to reach out to workers in the ‘shadow’ of the formal economy, especially those providing domestic services in private households, as well as the need to develop a protective framework, by collective bargaining and/or legislative means, for the provision of household services in general.
The ETUC is also joining the ITUC (International Trade Union Organisation) in their campaign to stop the exploitation of domestic workers.
The IAM also contended that a Delta supervisor promised to change work schedules to grant more weekends off so as to mirror what the PMNW Sim Techs receive under their contract with the IAM.
In addition, the Organization argueed that Delta prematurely used seniority integration committees to offer Sim Techs more favorable seniority integration than the IAM’s standard methodology of straight seniority.
Finally, the IAM contended that Delta routinely misstated Board procedures, rulings, and law which resulted in confusing employees and distorting the facts.
One example is the circulation of a “Monthly Base Rate Comparison” contrasting monthly pay and benefits for Sim Techs at Delta and other airlines, which included an average number representing union dues which was higher than the amount PMNW Sim Techs pay.
Delta responded that the pay increases were pre-planned, and since its emergence from bankruptcy, it had consistently and publicly committed to its non-contract employees that they would receive industry-wide standard pay by the end of 2010.
The pay raise would apply to the non-contract employees even if they voted for representation, but only until those employees were covered by the applicable collective bargaining agreement (CBA).
Delta denied that its supervisors offered to change work schedules, had coercive one-on-one meetings, denied access to break rooms for union representatives, distributed petitions on the proper craft or class of the Sim Techs, or conducted surveillance.
Delta contended “Such a minute difference would not be material in any event, even if it was a mistake or misrepresentation, which it was not.” Finally, Delta viewed the McCaskill-Bond legislation, Public Law 110-161, Div.
K, Title I, § 117, as legally requiring it to create seniority integration committees before representation was resolved.
Delta and the IAM are currently litigating the McCaskill-Bond requirements in federal court.

As a result, Delta suggested that the Board should exercise its discretion and decline making a decision on the permissibility of the seniority committees as the lawsuit is still pending with the United States District Court for the
A SMALL GROUP OF LARGE TRANSNATIONAL automotive parts manufacturers have enjoyed significant growth since the early 1980s, in important part as a result of the liberalization of global trading rules and the restructuring of the automobile industry.
1 Over the same period many states have retreated from the labour market regulations and social welfare provisions that underpinned the post-World War II Fordist systems of production and union-based models of worker representation.
This retreat by the state has created a space for these rapidly expanding parts manufacturers to experiment with new models of work organization and non-union forms of worker representation.
While unions are in decline, and some companies are reverting to the pre-World War II unitarist model of human resources based on market power, this is an incomplete analysis of the changes taking place.
Katz and Darbishire have shown how the decline of unions is related to patterns of workplace practices that to varying degrees diverge from national models of industrial relations.
2 Others have analysed the non-deterministic dialectic between transnational corporate regulation of labour and local regulatory systems.
3 Far from convergence to a single work organization or human resources model as suggested by Womack, Jones and Ross, 4 these works indicate a rich diversity of outcomes shaped as much by the differing strategies of individual companies as the constraints imposed by different systems of national state regulation.
Our analysis rests on a variety of sources.
Particularly important, however, are interviews with Magna personnel.
The nature of these interviews, and details on the methodology that guided them, are outlined in the Appendix.
An important element of labour relations in most unionized plants in Canada and the US is the recognition of seniority rights as a criterion for promotions, job transfers and layoffs.
At Magna, seniority is less significant.
For promotions, seniority is a factor only where managers deem candidates to be equally qualified.
Promotion normally requires good work records and cooperative attitudes.
According to Magna's employee handbook, "promotion means giving a broader service and a greater commitment.
" Seniority also has little bearing on job transfers to other Magna plants.
Finding a new job within the Magna system largely depends on managerial discretion.
Seniority also appears to play a limited role in access to training.
In Canada, Magna's success in constructing a model of non-union worker representation is conditional on external factors, especially the work path employees follow in becoming Magna employees and the options they see themselves having should they leave Magna.
Many of those interviewed came to the plant after working in more peripheral, precarious labour markets in Canada or in low labour standard areas in Southern and Eastern Europe and Asia.
Most had no experience of collective gains made through labour militancy and solidarity in unionized workplaces.
When workers talk about wages and benefits at Magna, they often compare them to worse wages and benefits at their previous jobs.
In the Canadian case, Magna's success in constructing a non-union model of worker representation centres on a management strategy of "unite and rule.
" At plant and firm levels, explanatory emphasis has been placed on a multifaceted strategy that combines soft management techniques, and an ethos of labour-management reciprocity and interdependence of interests, with a range of material rewards that are contingent on both worker cooperation and company success.
Magna's Open Door Policy is built around a grievance system that integrates elements of worker voice and representation, and provides a strong sense of fairness.
Yet the best indicator of management success is the fact that most issues are resolved by work groups and supervisors as "problems" before being articulated as "grievances.
"
In the following section we compare the foregoing analysis of worker representation in Magna's Canadian plants with worker representation at a Magna plant in Mexico.
Magna has fourteen auto parts plants in Mexico which employ about 10,000 people, somewhat less than half of Magna's employment levels in Canada.
One of these parts plants, Autotek, a stamping and assembly plant, employs about 800 workers.
A greenfield plant set up in 1992, Autotek is located in Puebla, Mexico's fourth largest city and an important industrial centre in the south-central part of the country.
24 Puebla's auto industry, both assembly and parts, is its most important, and accounts for over 40 percent of its manufacturing employment.
25 Volkswagen, the anchor to Puebla's automotive industry, has an assembly plant employing about 12,000 people.
Together with its 85 supply plants, VW employs about 100,000 in Puebla.

As we have shown, in Canada Magna has successfully shaped a widespread perception among workers of a strong set of common interests with management at both the level of the workplace and the level of the firm.
Labour-management conflict is defused and transformed to an important degree through conflict resolution mechanisms that afford workers a measure of "due process" and through the creation of a sense of reciprocity and egalitarianism in worker-manager relations.
At Autotek, labour-management conflict is also defused, but in different ways.
Management power is exercised more overtly and there is more suppression of conflict.
Much worker cooperation stems from a sense of common purpose in the pursuit of profits, wages, and job security.
At the same time, much cooperation is also elicited through workers' calculation of rewards and punishment.
This is a stronger factor in the equation of cooperation at Autotek than at Magna in Canada.
In contrast to Canada, where Magna pays what workers generally regard as "reasonable" wages for the auto parts sector, at Autotek Magna has a high wage policy relative to local wages.
According to union leaders, Autotek wages and benefits for semi-skilled production workers are the third highest among manufacturing firms in the area, and much higher than wages paid by other auto parts manufacturers.
At Autotek base wages (exclusive of benefits and bonuses) for operators are about $13–17 us per day (approximately 150–190 pesos).
Autotek wages are even higher when workers work overtime: under Mexican labour law, workers are paid double time after base weekly hours 32 and triple time after nine hours of overtime in a week.
Autotek also subsidizes worker transportation and meals.
As has been indicated, segmented internal labour markets are an important feature of the Magna model in Canada.
In Mexico, Magna has no equivalent of a large, second tier, temporary labour force of production workers to act as a buffer protecting core workers against layoffs.
Although there are temporary workers at Autotek, management estimates these are less than five percent of the workforce.
In Canada, external labour markets are a strong conditioning framework for worker allegiance to management: in Mexico this conditioning framework is far more powerful.
Although Mexico's official rate of unemployment was under four percent in 2004, this figure vastly underestimates unemployment levels.
For example, a person is counted as employed if that person has worked a least an hour in the week preceding the government unemployment survey.
Furthermore, most Mexicans have few incentives to report their unemployment status, not least because there is no unemployment insurance in the country.
According to Mexico's office of statistics, 28 percent of the workforce is in the informal sector.
Indicative of significant employment instability, an estimated 62 percent of salaried jobs created in 2000–2004 did not have social benefits, 49 percent of the salaried jobs created in this period were based on oral contracts, and 72 percent of the jobs created were in businesses with five or fewer employees.
Over 300,000 manufacturing jobs were lost in this period, 33 and real wages in the manufacturing sector were decidedly flat in 2002–2004.

The contrasts between the industrial relations regimes in the two countries are crucial to the differences in Magna's model of worker representation at the Canadian and Mexican plants.
The Federal Labour Law and the Federal Social Security Law in Mexico are major factors promoting variations between the way the Magna model operates in Canada and in Mexico.
To an important extent these federal laws substitute for the Magna Charter and for much of Magna's human resource management strategy in the firm's Canadian plants.
The Federal Labour Law's most important impact has been on Magna's profit-sharing policy.
As has been explained, the profit-sharing program at Autotek is a creation of Mexican national law and is structured differently from its Canadian counterpart.
In Mexico profit shares are paid in cash annually; in Canada profit shares are paid mainly in Magna shares and are deferred payments available to workers with a lag of ten years or more.
Although the Canadian and Mexican profit sharing programs help to shift the zero-sum relation between wages and profits into a "win win" profitability alliance between workers and management, in Canada Magna's profit sharing policy lies at the heart of a unique and more developed set of corporate welfarist initiatives.
The Federal Labour Law also requires that firms such as Autotek pay a Christmas bonus of at least two weeks' wages to all employees.
In addition, the Mexican Federal Social Security system provides a state regulated substitute for many of the welfare provisions found in the Magna model in Canada.
Under the Federal Social Security Law, employers such as Autotek are required to make contributions to provide for workers' health care, housing and retirement savings.
These contributions are a sizeable proportion of wages, averaging more than a quarter of wage and salary costs.
To the extent that Magna is engaged in welfarist initiatives in Mexico, much of these lie beyond the level of the plant in meso-level corporatist relations among Magna, the union and the local municipal and state governments.

John Holmes assisted us with his thoughts and files on Magna.
Huberto Juárez Núñez, Amellali Salgado and Aleida Martinez helped make the Mexican portion of this study possible.

This paper is based on extensive direct observation of work relations, as well as on corporate documents and interviews with auto industry analysts, managers, and production workers.
The authors observed work arrangements in three plants, two at the complex described above as well as another Magna plant in a different community in Southern Ontario.
The authors did open-ended interviews with four government and private sector auto industry analysts, two corporate-level Magna managers, and five plant-level managers.
Often we interviewed these informants several times.
After several visits to the Magna plant in Canada that is the subject of this study, management agreed to provide us with access to their workforce.
We provided criteria for selecting employees to be interviewed.
Selection criteria included varied seniority, a cross section of jobs and skill levels, and both genders.
We did not request interviews with temporary workers.
Seventeen employees were interviewed.
Six were women.
Half had less than ten years of seniority and half had more than ten years.
Three were immigrants from Asia and three were immigrants from Europe.
We interviewed seven production workers, four line leaders, two skilled trades and four engineers.
Private space was provided by the company for the interviews.
Employees were interviewed by one or both of the authors.
There were no restrictions on what we talked about nor did management request an outline of what would be discussed.
Participants were instructed that the project was an academic study independent of Magna and was being done through McMaster University.
They were asked to sign a consent form which indicated all discussions were confidential.
The interviews were semi-structured lasting approximately an hour in duration.
It was not our sense that the company had selected workers with a particular bias.
The workers we interviewed were critical of the company where they felt this was warranted, but also were relatively consistent in how they described Magna labour relations.
Our concerns about sample bias were further eased as a result of interviews with four injured workers whose employment with Magna had been terminated.
While they were extremely critical of how they had been treated by the company after their injury, they spoke much more positively about their treatment before being injured.
They confirmed the broad tenor of our findings with currently employed Magna workers.
In order to protect the anonymity of these workers we do not name them in our study.

Indeed, overall job security at Magna may well exceed that of Big Three auto firms: in 1992 gm was "minutes away from declaring bankruptcy" and a strike in 1998 "seemed to set a seal on its demise" ["Special Report: General Motors," The Economist, 24 January 2004, 62.
] Recently, Ford and gm corporate debt ratings have fallen to "junk bond" status.

Normal work weeks at Autotek are six days.
Weekly base hours are 48 on day shifts, 45 on afternoons, and 42 on night shifts.
Work shift duration is specified under Mexican labour law.
On 7 September 2010 Public Services International (PSI) will be joining the ITUC (International Trade Union Confederation), trade unionists and human rights activists around the world in showing solidarity for our brothers and sisters in Swaziland and supporting their call for democracy.
Trade unionists from across the Americas gather in Colombia: from Canada to Argentina and every country between – 300 members of the global union federation Public Services International will gather in Cartagena, Colombia on 7-12 September for PSI's 10th Inter-American Regional Conference.
At the top of the agenda will be discussion of how to protect trade union rights, and defend the quality public services that citizens rely on from being privatised or cut in the wake of the global economic crisis.
PSI congratulates the government of Bolivia, the civil society activists and the trade unions who campaigned to pass the resolution on the right to water and sanitation in the United Nations General Assembly on 28 July 2010.
This resolution clearly shows that water and sanitation are inherently political concerns, not just about business opportunities.

RENGO will strive for the full application of six of the eight ILO Core Conventions, which have been already ratified, as well as striving for an early ratification of Conventions 105 (abolition of forced labor) and 111 (prohibition of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation) that have not yet been ratified.
In addition, RENGO will strengthen its efforts for the ratification of “treaties RENGO preferentially demands to be ratified.” RENGO will continue its efforts for the realization of reforms of the civil service system according to the recommendations of ILO’s Freedom of Association Committee.
3.
RENGO will strengthen its lobbying of relevant ministries and agencies and will cooperate with trade unions in relevant countries in such frameworks as the ASEAN Plus Three (Japan, China and South Korea) and bilateral FTAs/EPAs (free trade agreements/economic partnership agreements) so that not only core labor standards for workers in the countries are maintained, but also sustainable economic growth, improvement in people’s lives and employment situations, environmental protection, and improvement in safety and health are encouraged.
6.
RENGO will promote policy recommendations to G8 Summits, G14 Summits, G20 Summits, the ILO, the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development), the WTO (World Trade Organization), the IMF (International Monetary Fund), the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the APEC and the ASEM (Asia-Europe Meeting), and strive for the realization of fair and sustainable globalization together with Global Unions, such as the ITUC and the OECD-TUAC (Trade Union Advisory Committee).
In this case, RENGO will take into careful consideration consistency within the policies and systems it demands, such as the enhancement of international regulations and supervision of investment funds.
13.
RENGO will address such issues as the eradication of poverty in the world as a step toward building a fair and sustainable global society.
Specifically, RENGO strives for improving and disseminating activities of the Forum for NGO-Trade Unions in International Cooperation toward the settlement of various issues that are referred to in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to make it easier for each union member to participate.
At the same time, RENGO will consider cooperation with various sectors, together with NGOs, to arouse public opinion for achieving the MDGs.
In addition, RENGO cooperates with the development cooperation and education activities of the Japan International Labour Foundation (JILAF) while lobbying the Japanese Government for improving the quantity and quality of ODA (official development assistance).
Protection and establishment of human rights, trade union rights and democracy
14.
RENGO will proactively participate in campaigns of Global Unions, such as the ITUC, toward the protection of human rights and trade union rights in every country of the world.
In particular, RENGO will cooperate with the ITUC-AP and each national center to protect human rights and trade union rights in the Asia-Pacific region.
For the democratization of Burma, RENGO will strengthen its pressure on the military regime in Burma and its lobbying of the Japanese Government and international organizations by cooperating with groups that support Burmese democratization.
In addition, RENGO will further galvanize public opinion for an early realization of Burma’s democratization as well as being continuously committed to the ITUC Burma Campaign to demand that Japanese companies cease economic activities in Burma.
Implementation of regular consultation and exchange with trade unions in each country
15.
RENGO will hold bilateral discussions aimed at the enhancement of cooperation, sharing of information, and exchanges of experiences for overcoming common challenges to the realization of fair and sustainable globalization.
RENGO will discuss such agendas as world economic crises, climate change, financial regulations, nuclear disarmament and peace in a timely manner with the DGB (Confederation of German Trade Unions), the TUC (Trades Union Congress) in the UK, and the AFL-CIO (American Federation of Labor – Congress of Industrial Organizations), respectively.
In addition, RENGO will interact and discuss issues with trade unions in South Korea and China as steps toward protecting workers’ rights and overcoming common problems.
i. Global Unions: Formed as a framework of cooperation between the ICFTU, each GUF and the OECD-TUAC at the World Congress of the ICFTU (International Confederation of Free Trade Unions) held in Durban, South Africa in 2000 with the objective of dealing effectively with rapid globalization.
The framework was further strengthened at the ICFTU World Congress held in Miyazaki, Japan in 2004 and was incorporated into its constitution.
At present, the ITUC, each GUF and the OECD-TUAC have formed the Council of Global Unions for various campaigns since the ITUC founding congress in 2006.
The ETUC exists to speak with a single voice, on behalf of the common interests of workers, at European level.
Founded in 1973, it now represents 82 trade union organisations in 36 European countries, plus 12 industry-based federations.
The ETUC believes that workers’ consultation, collective bargaining, social dialogue and good working conditions are key to promoting innovation, productivity, competitiveness and growth in Europe.
Twice a year, meetings are held between the EU Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN), the European Central Bank (ECB), the Commission and the social partners within the framework of the Macro-Economic Dialogue (MED), established in 1998.
At the same time, the ETUC negotiates with the employers at European level through the " European social dialogue ".
This is mirrored in the social dialogue, in 35 different industrial sectors so far, coordinated by the European Industry Federations.
Following formal EU recognition of the Social Partners’ right to negotiate framework agreements at European level, the ETUC has signed three cross-sectoral European framework agreements with its European employer counterparts, which have been ratified by the Council of Ministers and implemented as Directives:on parental leave (1996), part-time work (1997), and fixed-term contracts (1999).
Trade unions and employers themselves are implementing further European-level deals under the system of ’autonomous’ social dialogue, covering conditions for teleworkers (2002), work-related stress (2004), harassment and violence at work (2007) and on inclusive labour markets (2010).
Finally, the signing of frameworks of action such as the framework of actions for the life-long learning development of competencies and qualifications (2002) and for equality between men and women (2005) should be emphasised.
The Caribbean Community (CARICOM) Secretariat is pleased to present to the Social Partners, this Declaration of Labour and Industrial Relations Principles which was unanimously approved by the Thirteenth Meeting of the Standing Committee of Ministers responsible for Labour (SCML), 26-28 April 1995 in The Bahamas.
The Declaration sets out the general Labour Policy to which the Region aspires, consistent with international standards and other international instruments.
It is an important policy guide on labour matters for the Social Partners and will contribute to the development of a healthy industrial relations climate, and enhanced social partnership.
It underscores the rights and responsibilities of the Social Partners, and provides the bases for the development of national labour policies, and inform the enactment of labour legislation.
The SCML, in approving this policy guide on labour matters, has given tangible expression of its commitment to equity and social justice through the adoption of common labour standards and principles.
This is an important pillar in the creation of the CARICOM Single Market, inherent in which is a CARICOM Labour Market.
I wish to place on record my sincere appreciation to the members of the Regional Tripartite Working Party of Labour Officials from Member States, the Caribbean Congress of Labour (CCL), the Caribbean Employers' Confederation (CEC), the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) Secretariat, and the International Labour Organisation (ILO), for their invaluable contribution in the development of this Declaration to guide our labour relations practices in the Region.
I also wish to commend the vision of the SCML in commissioning the drafting of the Declaration and for their approval oft he final text of the Declaration.
"commissioned the drafting of a CARICOM Declaration of Labour and Industrial Relations Principles outlining the general Labour and Industrial Relations Policy to which the Region aspires taking into account international labour standards".
The document was revised into the first draft, and transmitted to Member States, OECS Secretariat, CCL, CEC, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and participants of the Second Working Party Meeting, and some individual labour experts for further study and comment.
Member States also conducted tripartite consultations on the draft Declaration.

The Member States shall employ their best endeavours to consult with the Social Partners in establishing the relevant principles and policies to be applied in conditions and situations of financial stringencies.
Frequently Asked Questions Pertaining to the Issuance of Wage Determinations Under the McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract Act (SCA) of 1965, as Amended
Every service employee performing any of the Government contract work under a service contract in excess of $2,500 must be paid not less than the monetary wages, and must be furnished fringe benefits, which the Secretary of Labor has determined to be prevailing in the locality for the classification in which the employee is working or the wage rates and fringe benefits (including any accrued or prospective wage rates and fringe benefits) contained in a predecessor contractor's collective bargaining agreement.
The wage rates and fringe benefits required are specified in the SCA wage determination included in the contract.
If no wage determination has been made applicable to the contract, employees performing work under the contract must be paid not less than the federal minimum wage provided in section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act .
Service contracts which do not exceed $2,500 are not subject to wage and fringe benefit determinations or to the safety and health requirements of the SCA.
However, the SCA does require that employees performing work on such contracts be paid not less than the above minimum wage rate provided by section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act.
Questions regarding wage determinations and how they are established may be directed to the Branch of Service Contract Wage Determinations.
Questions regarding a contractor's compliance with the SCA wage determination applicable to a particular contract should be directed to the nearest Wage and Hour office, U.S. Department of Labor, which is listed in the blue pages of the telephone book.
No part of the services covered under the SCA will be performed in buildings, surroundings, or under working conditions which are unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous to the health and safety of services employees.
Safety and Health provisions of the SCA are administered by the Occupational, Safety, and Health Administration (OSHA).
Wage determinations are developed based on available data showing the rates that are prevailing in a specific locality.
Where a single rate is paid to a majority (more than 50%) of the workers in a classification of service employees engaged in similar work in a particular locality, that rate is determined to prevail.
When information is used from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) or other surveys, statistical measurements of central tendency (median) and the average (mean) are considered reliable indicators of the prevailing rate.
Which of these statistical measurements will be applied in a given case will be determined after a careful analysis of the overall survey, separate classification data, patterns existing between survey periods, and the way separate classification data interrelate.
Use of the median is the general rule.
However, the mean may be used in situations where, after analysis, it is determined that the median is not a reliable indicator.
In addition, some occupational rates on the wage determination may be taken directly from the Non-Appropriated Fund schedule, Federal Wage System schedule, or the General Schedule "white collar" pay scales.
Finally, several methodologies were developed to aid the analyst in developing rates for classes where no survey data exists.
Must a wage determination be requested if the contract requires less than five employees?
Yes.
The contracting agency must request a wage determination for every covered contract in excess of $2,500 regardless of the number of employees expected to be employed on the contract.
If the contract involves more than five service employees, the Department of Labor must issue a wage determination; however, this does not limit the contracting agency's obligation to request a wage determination for all contracts in excess of $2,500.
In an emergency, how do you obtain a wage determination?
You may call the Wage and Hour Division, Branch of Service Contract Wage Determinations, and speak with a supervisor at (202) 693-0073.
Is the rate on the wage determination the minimum hourly rate?
Yes.
The wage rate on the wage determination is the prevailing rate for the occupation in the locality.
The prevailing rate then becomes the minimum rate that the contractor must pay its employees working on the contract.
What can be done if the employee is not being paid the wage rate listed in the wage determination?
How are wage rates obtained for occupations not listed in the wage determination?
Any class of service employee not listed in the wage determination must be classified by the contractor to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e.
appropriate level of skill comparison) between the unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.
A class of service employee not listed in the wage determination must be classified by the contractor to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e.
appropriate level of skill comparison) between the unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.
The conformance procedure for the unlisted class must be submitted by the contractor to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after the unlisted class of employee performs any contract work.
The contracting officer then reviews the proposed action and submits the conformance with their concurrence, and/or comments to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for approval.
The Wage and Hour Division will approve, modify, or disapprove the action or render a final determination in the event of disagreement within 30 days of receipt or will notify the contracting officer within 30 days of receipt that additional time is necessary.
In the case of a contract modification, an exercise of an option or extension of an existing contract, or any other case where a contractor succeeds a contract under which the classification in question was previously conformed, a new conformed wage rate may be assigned to the conformed classification by indexing (i.e.
adjusting) the previously conformed rate by an amount equal to the average percentage increase or decrease between the wages specified for all classifications to be used on the contract or used in the same broad occupational category which are listed in the current wage determination, and those specified for the corresponding classifications in the previously applicable wage determination.
However, the contractor has the option of resubmitting a new conformance request.
The vacation time continues, as long as there is no break in service.
The contractor by whom a worker is employed at the time the vacation right vests (i.e.
on the employee's anniversary date of employment) must provide the full benefit required by the wage determination which is applicable on that date, whether or not it is the predecessor or the successor contractor.
This is described in Title 29, Part 4 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Section 4.173.
Do employees receive fringe benefits when they are working under a wage determination?
Every covered contract in excess of $2,500 contains a provision specifying the fringe benefits to be furnished to service employees and must be paid in addition to the minimum wage.
The fringe benefit amount is listed in the wage determination.
SCA makes no distinction, with respect to its compensation provisions, between temporary, part-time, and full-time employees.
However, temporary and part-time employees are only entitled to an amount of the fringe benefits specified in an applicable determination which is proportionate to the amount of time spent in covered work.
No.
Fringe benefits are required to be provided separate from and in addition to the specified minimum hourly rate provided on the wage determination.
Unless otherwise specified on the applicable wage determination, health and welfare payments are due for all hours, including paid vacation, sick leave, and holiday hours, up to a maximum of 40 hours per week and 2, 080 hours per year on each contract.
No, not for the first year.
The successor contractor's obligation is to insure that all service employees are paid no less than the wages and fringe benefits to which the employees would have been entitled, including prospective increases, if employed under the predecessor's collective bargaining agreement for the first year of the contract (i.e.
irrespective of whether the successor's employees were or were not employed by the predecessor contractor).
The obligation of the successor contractor is limited to the wage and fringe benefit requirements of the predecessor's collective bargaining agreement and does not extend to other items such as seniority, grievance procedures, work rules, overtime, etc.
Do not enter the CBA occupations on the SF 98-A.
Only classes which are not covered by the CBA should be listed separately on the SF 98-A so that the appropriate area-wide wage determination can be issued for those classes of employees.
THE FOOD-RENGO IS THE LARGEST INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION FOR TRADE UNIONS IN THE FOOD AND ALLIED INDUSTRIES IN JAPAN.
The Food-Rengo, the largest industrial trade union organization in the food and allied industries in Japan, was established on 19 November 2002, with the purpose of strengthening the ability to make industrial policies and to develop the union movement in the food and allied industries.
The establishment of the Food-Rengo was brought through a merger of Shokuhin-Rengo (Japan Federation of Foods and Tobacco Workers’Unions which was formed in 1995 through a merger of Shokuhin-Roren, Zen-Shokuhin-Domei and Zen-Tobacco) and Shokuhin-Rokyo (Japan Food Industry Workers’Unions Council, formed in 1989).

FedEE provides a practical HR resource for companies operating internationally across Europe, with a focus on employment law, pay and labour relations.
First established with EU funding in 1989, it is now a rapidly-growing independent organisation serving the needs of multinational employers worldwide.
Judicial power is vested in the Federal Supreme Court (Tribunal fédéral, TF) and in lower courts whose organisation falls within the competence of the cantons.
The TF is composed of 30 judges elected for six years each.
The TF is the supreme judicial body in all spheres, including all labour matters (Art.
188 Const.).
As for the lower courts, jurisdiction is organised differently from one canton to another.
One half of them have created special courts for disputes falling under private labour law.
In the sphere of labour legislation, law-making power rests mainly with the Confederation.
Amongst other things, this encompasses protection of workers, relations between employers and workers, placement services and the determination the scope of application of collective labour agreements (Art.
110.1 Const.).
Moreover, the Confederation is competent to legislate on unemployment insurance (Art.
114.1 Const.
) and on social security.
Lastly, the Confederation legislates on civil law (Art.
122.1 Const.
), which includes legislation on employment contracts.
The Swiss Constitution prohibits all forms of discrimination (Art.
8.2 Const.).
It specifically prescribes equal treatment of men and women and equal pay for work of equal value (Art.
8.3 Const.).
It further guarantees the free choice of occupation, free access to an economic activity (Art.
27.2 Const.
) and freedom of association (Art.
23 and 28 Const.).
Besides, the Constitution sets out social objectives, which cannot however be directly invoked before the courts as subjective rights but which nonetheless bind the Swiss lawmaker.
These include the objective that all persons capable of work should be able to practise an occupation under equitable conditions so as to assure their maintenance, and that whereby children can receive an appropriate education (Art.
41 Const.
).
The main source of labour law is federal legislation.
In addition, federal ordinances, collective agreements and standard contracts play a key role.
Nevertheless, Swiss labour law is not codified.
A distinction can be drawn between private labour law, whose provisions pertain to the employment contract, public labour law, which imposes minimal standards for worker protection, and collective labour law.
The employment contract is governed by Arts.
319-362 of the Code of Obligations (CO), which became effective in 1911.
Employment contract law was extensively reviewed in 1971.
As for the provisions of individual labour law stemming from public law, the Federal Labour Statute of 13 March 1964 (LT) is the most important law.
Alongside that law, there are the following main ones:
Collective labour law is regulated by the following provisions:
Industrial disputes: Federal Statute of 18 June 1914 on Factory Work; Federal Statute of 12 February 1949 on the Federal Labour Dispute Conciliation Office; Special Regulations of 2 September 1949 pertaining to the Statute on the Federal Labour Dispute Conciliation Office.
Collective labour agreements are concluded between employers or their associations and workers' associations.
Their legal nature is that of statutes.
Some of their provisions have a normative effect that nevertheless binds only the parties to collective agreements and, in the case of associations, their members.
The possibility does however exist for employers or workers employed by an employer who is bound by a collective agreement to submit to it.
At the request of all the contracting parties, the Federal Government or the competent cantonal authority may extend the scope of a collective agreement to the employers and workers belonging to the branch of the economy or the profession concerned and who are not bound by this agreement, provided that the requirements of Arts.
2-3 of the Federal Statute of 28 September 1956 allowing for the extension of the scope of application of collective agreements are met.
Standard contracts are ordinances designed to protect workers in fields where no collective agreements as yet exist.
They are issued either by the Federal Government or by the cantons and lay down clauses on the conclusion, subject and purpose of various types of employment contracts (Art.
359.1 CO).
They apply directly to the employment relations that they govern, though the parties may depart from them by means of an individual agreement (Art.
360 CO).
No special form is required for an individual employment contract (Art.
320.1 CO).
However, when the duration of employment relationship is unlimited or of more than one month, the employer must inform by written the worker on specified work conditions (Art.
330b CO, such as name of the parties, the date of the beginning of the employment relationship, job description, salary conditions and weekly number of work hours.
Contracts for the hiring of commercial travellers: Commercial travellers are deemed to be all persons who undertake to negotiate or conclude business matters of any kind on behalf of the head of a commercial enterprise (Art.
347.1 CO).
Business travellers' employment contracts must be concluded in writing.
Business travellers are bound by their employer's instructions.
Termination of employment must meet certain special conditions (Art.
350 CO).
During the probationary period the employment contract may be terminated with a 7-day notice period (Art.
335b.1 CO).
The probationary period is one month.
Various provisions can be agreed in writing, by standard contract or collective agreement, though the probationary period may not exceed three months (Art.
335b.2 CO).
The employment contract is suspended during strikes or lockouts.
The consequence of suspension is that the contracting parties are relieved of their main obligations under the employment contract, especially that of providing labour, and, correspondingly, that of wage payment.
Two types of termination of employment relationships are envisaged under Swiss law.
The employer may terminate the contract by ordinary dismissal or by means of dismissal with immediate effect.
The ordinary period of dismissal notice varies according to length of service.
The notice period is of one month during the first year of service, two months for the employment from two to nine years, and three months for the employment whose duration exceeds nine years.
The timeframes envisaged under the law may be changed by written agreement, standard employment contract or collective agreement, but may not be less than one month.
Exceptions to this rule are admitted during the first year and if they have been set by a collective agreement (Art.
335c CO).
In the case of collective redundancies, the employer may terminate the employment contracts with a 30-day notice period (Art.
335d CO).
The employer is also required to consult the workers' representatives before proceeding to redundancies and notify the cantonal labour office.
Dismissal is deemed to be a misuse of rights if it is motivated, among others, by personal reasons or the fact that a worker has exercised his/her constitutional rights, especially the right to participate in trade union activities or a works council, or if he/she is performing a compulsory military or civil service.
Collective dismissals in breach of the rules on consultation procedures also constitute a misuse of rights (Art.
336 CO).
The party liable for the misuse of rights for the termination of employment must pay compensation which is decided by the judge and may not exceed an amount corresponding to six months' wages.
Only dismissal in an untimely manner is deemed to be void.
The employer may terminate an employment contract immediately and without notice if there are good grounds for such immediate termination, especially circumstances which, in keeping with the rules of good faith, render the continuation of the work relationship intolerable for said employer (Art.
337 CO).
If termination with immediate effect is unjustified, it does nonetheless remain valid.
However, the party who terminates the contract with immediate effect without justifiable cause must indemnify the other party.
Termination of employment at the initiative of the worker
The maximum weekly number of working hours is 45 for workers engaged by industrial enterprises and for employees, whilst it is 50 hours for all other workers (Art.
9 LT).
Nevertheless, under certain conditions, this maximum may be extended by four hours at the most, either with compensation within a set timeframe or - in exceptional cases - without compensation.
Workers may perform night work only if certain conditions are met (Art.
10 LT).
Night work is allowed in certain specified branches under the OLT 2, in the event of an urgent need (Art.
27 OLT 1) or owing to a technical or economic imperative (Art.
28 OLT 1).
In most branches of activity, working hours are set by collective agreements, and range between 40 and 42 hours weekly.
There are branches, however, where the social partners have not bargained.
In various sectors, an annual number of working hours has been introduced so as to allow employers more flexibility.
For 2006, the average weekly number of hours worked was 41.8 in
Overtime working hours are compensated by a rest period of the same duration or by a salary increase of 25 per cent at least (Art.
321c.3 CO).
The employer must grant workers at least four weeks of vacations per year and at least five weeks to workers up to the age of 20 years (Art.
329a.1 CO).
During such vacations, the employer must continue to pay wages, except where the worker performs work for a third party during her/his vacations to the detriment of the employer's legitimate interests (Art.
329d CO).
Besides, each worker is entitled to one day off per week - Sunday as a rule (Art.
329.1 CO).
Exceptionally, the employer may grant the worker two half-days free instead of a full day, provided that it is required by specific work conditions and the worker consents to it.
Pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers are entitled to be assigned such work as does not endanger their health or that of their child (Art.
35 LT; Chapter 5 OLT 1).
In no case must their work schedule exceed nine hours per day (Art.
60 OLT 1).
Night work is forbidden for expectant mothers and for those having recently given birth until the end of the 16th week following childbirth.
If the employer is unable to provide equivalent work appropriate to these circumstances, the women concerned are entitled to 80 per cent of their wages (Art.
35 LT).
Women are entitled to continue receiving their wages for a certain time after giving birth.
The length of this period depends above all on the duration of the employment relationship (Art.
324a CO).
Many collective agreements contain provisions more advantageous to women workers than those prescribed by law.
Besides, workers are entitled to free days to attend to personal matters, for family events such as death, serious illness, the marriage of a close relative, the birth of a child or to seek a new job (Art.
329.3 CO).
The precise conditions are often set by collective agreements.
Generally, they stipulate one to three days leave for a family event, depending on its nature.
The daily rest period must be at least 12 hours.
Night work and work on Sundays is allowed only under certain very limited conditions and only for workers of 16 years and over (Arts.
58, 59 OLT 1).
Overtime work may be effected only by young people over 16 years of age and on working days, without exceeding the limits set for daytime work (Art.
57 OLT 1).
Any person undergoing discrimination in the termination of an employment contract may claim compensation from the employer (Art.
9 LEg).
If dismissal comes in the wake of an allegation of discrimination, it may even be reversible (Art.
10 LEg).
The Swiss lawmaker has set no minimum wage.
On the contrary, wages are very often set by collective agreements and standard employment contracts.
Nevertheless, the wages thus set are no more than minimum wages from which the parties to an employment contract may depart, to the benefit of the worker (Art.
357d.2 CO).
Remuneration must be paid at the end of each month, except where the collective agreement or standard contract provides otherwise.
Shorter timeframes may also be set in individual employment contracts (Art.
323.1 CO).
's economic, social and political life.
Apart from the negotiation and conclusion of collective agreements, their task also encompasses participation in lawmaking through consultation and the pursuit of workers' interests before the courts.
Nevertheless, only one-fifth of
There are no legal provisions on the legal form or the organisation of trade unions.
In practice, the most common form is that of an association; trade unions are sometimes created in the form of cooperative societies.
Freedom of association is guaranteed under Art.
28 of the Federal Constitution.
It covers not only the freedom to join together to defend common interests but also the freedom to join or refrain from joining a trade union.
This freedom of association is protected by the prohibition of any clause in collective agreements that could compel employers or workers to join a contracting association (Union Security Clause, Art.
356a CO).
An "opt-in" clause is nevertheless admissible.
Such clauses are designed to oblige workers to submit to collective agreements without necessarily becoming members of one of the contracting association concerned.
That submission may also entail the obligation to pay a certain solidarity contribution set by the collective agreement.
Employers must also respect the freedom of association of workers.
It is protected - albeit with a degree of flexibility - by Art.
336.2a CO, which classifies as abuse of rights any dismissal on grounds of worker involvement in trade union activities.
The consequence of such dismissal is that the employer must pay compensation to the worker.
Collective labour agreements are negotiated and concluded by employers or employers' associations on the one hand, and workers' associations on the other.
To be eligible to become a party to a collective agreement, the workers' association must have acquired legal personality.
The right to bargain and conclude collective agreements is not restricted by law.
Nevertheless, an employers' association is not empowered to refuse to bargain a collective agreement with a workers' association with a view to weakening the position of workers.
Two types of provisions can be distinguished in collective agreements.
On the one hand, there are clauses concerning the terms and conditions of employment which are normative in effect.
They bind all employers and workers members of a contracting association, as well as all those who have opted into the collective agreement in question.
At the request of all the contracting parties, the normative effect may, under certain conditions, be extended to all employers and workers belonging to the economic branch covered by the agreement (Art.
1, Federal Statute of 28 September 1956 allowing for the extension of the scope of application of collective labour agreements).
The relevant competence is vested in the Federal Government or, in the case of a cantonal-level collective agreement, the competent cantonal authority, with the approval of the Federal Government.
The normative effects of collective agreements are direct and binding (Art.
357.1 CO).
The clauses in an individual employment contract that are contrary to the provisions of a collective agreement are null and void, and are automatically superseded by the latter provisions except where the exception concerned is more favourable to the workers (Art.
357.2 CO).
In addition to provisions with a normative effect, collective agreements also produce effects that concern the contracting parties exclusively.
Accordingly, the associations concerned are obliged to implement them and to preserve industrial peace (Art.
357a CO).
Pursuant to the first, it is incumbent upon the parties to ensure that all their members observe the provisions of the collective agreements and, if necessary to take enforcement measures to implement them.
The obligation to preserve industrial peace implies the duty to refrain from any kind of challenge to matters settled in the agreement.
In addition, the contracting parties often agree on other contractual provisions, such as clauses establishing compensation funds, joint committees or arbitration tribunals.
Collective agreements terminate upon expiry.
When they are not concluded for a set period, each party may denounce them upon expiry of one year, to take effect after six months (Art.
356c.2 CO).
The result of such denunciation is the cancellation of the collective agreement for all the contracting parties.
With the termination of a collective agreement, its normative effects also cease.
Workers' representatives enjoy certain rights of participation.
The employer must inform them about all matters pertaining to their task of representation, in particular concerning the implications of the enterprise's business performance for the staff (Art.
9, Participation Statute).
Furthermore, they may participate in the enterprise's decision making with regard to safety at work, the transfer of the enterprise and collective dismissals (Art.
10, Participation Statute).
Where the enterprise has no workers’ representation, these rights of participation are vested in each worker (Art.
4, Participation Statute).
Private disputes fall within the jurisdiction of civil courts.
As a general rule, labour law suits in which the amount in dispute is less than CHF 30,000 are subject to a simple and expeditious procedure (Art.
343.2 CO).
One-half of
's cantons have set up special courts for labour law disputes.
They are characterised by their procedural rules and the composition of the judges.
Appeals are heard by cantonal supreme courts, except in the canton de Geneva, where an appellate chamber fulfils this function.
Nevertheless, individual employment contracts or collective agreements often contain derogatory clauses providing for an arbitration procedure instead of action before State courts.
These clauses are valid if the arbitration envisaged is in conformity with the Arbitration Convention (Concordat sur l'arbitrage) of 27 March 1969.
Amongst labour disputes, a distinction can be drawn between disputes at law and disputes over interests.
The first encompass all disputes pertaining to the implementation and interpretation of agreements between the two sides.
In this connection, the parties may choose between an arbitration procedure and a judicial procedure.
In contrast, differences of interest arise during bargaining for a new agreement, and no party may stake a judicial claim.
Various State conciliation bodies have been created for the settlement of labour disputes, namely the Federal Conciliation Office and the permanent cantonal conciliation offices.
The first is set up by the Federal Department of the National Economy on the authorisation of the Federal Government at the request of the parties concerned (Art.
1, Federal Statute on the Federal Labour Dispute Conciliation Office (Loi fédérale concernant l'Office fédéral de conciliation en matière de conflits du travail).
The Federal Office deals only with differences of interest.
In contrast, the competence of the permanent cantonal conciliation offices also covers disputes at law.
They intervene either ex officio or at the request of the authorities or concerned parties to settle labour disputes at the cantonal level (Art.
31.1, Factory Work Statute (Loi sur le travail dans les fabriques)).
Should conciliation before the conciliation office be unsuccessful, the parties may request it to hand down a binding arbitral award.
However, such an arbitration procedure can take place only if all the parties agree to it.
Yet collective agreements often envisage the creation of conciliation committees or private arbitration tribunals.
In the event, the competence of these private institutions prevails over that of the State bodies (Art.
1.3, Federal Statute on the Federal Labour Dispute Conciliation Office; Art.
33, Factory Work Statute).
The right to strike is implicitly guaranteed under Art.
28.3 of the Swiss Constitution.
Striking is nevertheless only of minor significance as by far the most labour disputes are settled without recourse to industrial action.
There are no legal regulations pertaining to strike law.
The legal framework for strike action is determined solely by case law and the doctrine.
As a means of settling labour disputes, strike action plays a role that is strictly subsidiary to conciliation.
A strike is therefore only admissible after conciliation has failed.
Besides, it must respect the obligation to preserve industrial peace.
As striking is a means of exerting pressure on the social partner so as to obtain better terms and conditions of employment, it must only be used in pursuit of goals that can be regulated by a collective agreement.
Political strikes or those intended to enforce judicial aspirations are therefore illegal.
This is why a strike must furthermore be led by an organisation with the capacity to conclude collective agreements.
Lastly, strike action must observe the principles of fair conduct of labour disputes and of proportionality.
Some groups of persons do not enjoy the right to strike.
These include civil servants and senior management staff.
A lockout is a countermeasure by an employer against strike action.
It is defined as preventing access by several workers to the place of work and withholding payment of wages so as to enforce certain financial or labour conditions.
A lockout may be confined to certain groups of workers, only strikers or non-strikers for example, but it must not target only certain individual persons.
The prerequisites for lawfulness are largely the same as for strike action.
In particular, lockouts must conform to the principle of proportionality.
Like strikes, lockouts have the effect of suspending the main obligations stemming from employment contracts.
They are not tantamount to the cancellation of the contracts, however.
If the lockout is illegal, the employer must continue to pay workers' wages and indemnify any damages caused.
Under the Constitution of India, labour is a subject in the Concurrent List where both the Central & State Governments are competent to enact legislation subject to certain matters being reserved for the Centre.
Different labour laws have different eligibility criteria for establishments as well as to the workmen.
The main laws relating to labour protection, welfare and rights are enumerated below:
India is a member of the International Labor Organization (ILO) and adheres to 37 ILO conventions protecting worker rights.
Industrial relations are governed by the Industrial and Disputes Act of 1947.
The Act curbs unfair labor practices by employers, workers or trade unions through imposition of fines and imprisonment.
Workers may form or join unions of their choice.
Nevertheless, although unionized workers affiliated with national federations number more than seven million, their unions represent less than one fourth of the workers in the so called modern sector (subject to the Factories Act of 1948), primarily in state-owned concerns, and less than two percent of the total work force.
Where workers are unionized, wage increases are negotiated between unions and management.
Most unions are linked to political parties and their politicization has, in the past, created problems for domestic and foreign employers.
Labor militancy has declined in recent years, however, even among the formerly strident Communist-Marxist unions of West Bengal.
Workdays lost to strikes and lock-outs have declined every year since 1991.
Worker rights are broadly protected under Indian law.
The Industrial Disputes Act established freedom of association and collective bargaining rights.
The Factories Act regulates working conditions in mechanized factories employing more than 10 employees or non-mechanized factories employing more than twenty, prescribing standards for working conditions, working hours, handling and storage of materials, etc.
Other laws regulate employment of women and children and prohibit bonded labor.
Enforcement of these laws has been imperfect, however, and working conditions for workers not subject to the Factories Act are often quite poor.
Payment of wages is governed by the Payment of Wages Act, 1936 and Minimum Wages Act, 1948.
Industrial wages range from about USD 3 per day for unskilled workers, to over USD 150 per month for skilled 149 production workers.
Retrenchment, closure and layoffs are governed by the Industrial Disputes Act, which requires prior government permission to carry out layoffs or closure of businesses employing 100 or more workers.
In practice, permission is not easily obtained.
However, private firms
India's labour laws are overlapping, potentially inconsistent and cumbersome, with more than 45 pieces of relevant legislation.
Employers face particular difficulties in terminating employment and closing industrial establishments.
The Workmen's Compensation Act, 1923 provides for compensation to workers for industrial accidents and occupational diseases resulting in disability and death.
The minimum compensation for death is Rs80,000 and for total disability Rs90,000.
The maximum compensation for death is Rs456,000 and for total disability is Rs548,000.
The Act requires industrial establishments with 100 or more workers to draw up standing orders that specify working conditions (hours, shifts, holidays, vacation, sick pay, termination rules and grievance procedures).
These orders must meet minimum state standards, and they may be changed only with the consent of the workers or the unions and only to augment benefits.
The code of discipline in industry adopted by the Standing Labour Committee (a type of national 20 India International Tax and Business Guide conference held by the Ministry of Labour) defines the rights and responsibilities of employees and workers, and it provides for a grievance procedure and the settlement of disputes by voluntary arbitration.
The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986 prohibits child labour in hazardous occupations and regulates it in non-hazardous occupations.
The Trade Unions Act, 1926 provides for registration of trade unions.
By way of amendment in 2001, it reduced the multiplicity of trade unions.
The Indian government continues to oppose the linking of international trade with labour standards, but it is a signatory to 39 International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions.
In most places, any work beyond nine hours per day (up to ten hours, including rest intervals) is counted as overtime, usually paid at double the normal wage.
Night and Sunday work do not command a premium unless they result in overtime.
Holiday work generally requires double pay, although workers may opt for a substitute paid holiday.
Overtime for blue-collar staff is limited to four hours at a stretch.
In the organised sector, wages are often set by settlements reached between trade unions and management.
Severance pay of 15 days of average salary for each complete year of continuous service.
Health and safety of the employees are important aspects in an organization's smooth and effective functioning.
Good health and safety environment ensures an accident-free industrial set up.
Maintenance of occupational safety and health is very closely related to productivity and good employer-employee relationship.
Awareness of Occupational Health and Safety (OH&S) has improved in India considerably.
Achieving high OH&S performance has become one of the key aspects of business activities.
The Directorate General of Mines Safety (DGMS) and the Directorate General of Factory Advice Service and Labour Institutes (DGFASLI) are the two field organisations of the Ministry of Labour and Employment in the area of occupational safety and health in mines, factories and ports.
The Directorate General, Factory Advice Service & Labour Institutes (DGFASLI), Mumbai,which is an attached office of the Ministry of Labour and Employment,functions as a technical arm of the Ministry in regard to matters concerned with safety, health and welfare of workers in factories and ports/docks.
Directorate General of Mines Safety is the Indian Goverment Regulatory agency for safety in mines and oil-fields.
The mission of the DGMS is to continually improve safety and health standards, practices and performance in the mining industry and upstream petroleum industry.
Dismissal is governed under Belgian law by the provisions of the Act of 3 July 1978 respecting employment contracts and by the orders relating to this Act.
Some collective labour agreements, concluded under the auspices of the National Labour Council (CNT) and joint committees (CP), have restricted or modified the exercise of the legal right to terminate employment.
Special rules on collective dismissal have been laid down under Collective Labour Agreement (inter-industry) No.
24 of 2 October 1975 concluded by the CNT (as amended) and by a Royal Order of 24 May 1976 (as amended).
The Law of 26 June 2002 regulates the closure of enterprises.
The Generation Pact enacted by the Law of 23 December 2005 promotes active policy for restructuring and employment and applies to enterprises facing collective dismissals.
While the employer is not obliged to give reasons for dismissal (except for just cause or in the case of certain “protected” workers), he or she cannot act in an arbitrary manner.
In the event of a contested termination of employment, the burden is on the employer to prove that the termination is not unfair and it is up to the judge to render a decision.
“Collective dismissal” means any dismissal ordered for one or several reasons not attributable to the individual worker and affecting over a period of 60 days a number of workers:
There are two categories of workers who enjoy protection against dismissal: those covered by the general prohibition and those protected for particular reasons.
Staff representatives on the works council of the undertaking and members of the committee on occupational safety and health may be dismissed for economic or technical reasons or for just cause only, and for no other reason.
Certain other workers are protected from dismissal because of their positions or circumstances.
A trade union delegate may be dismissed only on grounds unrelated to the exercise of his or her functions.
The period of notice should be 28 days for blue-collar workers who have served for less than 20 years in the undertaking, and 56 days in the case of workers who have been employed in the service for at least 20 years (sec.
59, Act of 3 July 1978).
Pursuant to sec.
60 of the Act of 3 July 1978, if the wage earner has worked in the service of the undertaking for less than six months, and if it is stated in the contract of employment, the notice period may be shortened to a minimum of seven days.
Collective agreement N 75 of 20 December 2000, extended by Royal Decree of 10 February 2000, increased the terms of notice for blue-collar workers.
However, the criticised inequality between blue-collar and white-collar workers remains, as Collective agreement No.
75 does not cover all economic sectors.
Works councils, trade unions or joint committees must be informed of or consulted on the dismissal of protected workers.
The works councils must be consulted for the dismissal of an employee over 60 years of age.
The union delegation must be informed of the dismissal of employees over 60 years or of a trade union delegate for serious cause.
The trade union organization must be informed of the dismissal of a trade union delegate on any grounds.
The competent joint committee is to be informed of the dismissal on economic and technical grounds of members of the works councils and members of the committee on occupational safety and health.
Where an employer who intends to order a collective dismissal gives written notice to the workers’ representatives, he or she must give notice of the fact, by registered letter, to the director of the regional department of the National Employment Office (secs.
6 and 7, Royal Order of 24 May 1976).
The notice must indicate:
Collective dismissal is subject to a period of 30 days’ notice after the date on which the employer notified his or her intention of ordering a collective dismissal (sec.
9, Royal Order of 24 May 1976).
Further to the Renault case (related to the sudden announcement of the closure of the Renault plant in Vilvoorde in 1997), some changes to the procedure for collective dismissals were introduced by the promotion of Employment Act of 13 February 1998 clarifying the obligation of employers to consult with workers’ representatives and creating an obligation on employers to analyse and formally respond to any proposals from workers’ representatives.
In addition, sanctions for non-compliance are strengthened to include the reimbursement of any subsidies paid by the federal Government to the employer to create jobs.
In the event of collective dismissal, workers are entitled to compensation from the employer (sec.
7, Collective Labour Agreement No.
10 of 8 May 1973).
The amount of compensation is equivalent to one-half of the difference between the net basic remuneration, which is limited up to a certain ceiling, and the unemployment benefits which the worker can claim.
Such compensation is due for a period of four months (sec.
11, Collective Labour Agreement No.
10 of 8 May 1973).
There is no entitlement to reinstatement, except for members of the works council and the committee on occupational safety and health, who may request reinstatement if wrongfully dismissed.
If the employer refuses to reinstate them, he or she must pay them special compensation.

“The good news is that progress has been made in regulating normal working hours in developing and transition countries, but overall the findings of this study are definitely worrying, especially the prevalence of excessively long hours,” says Jon C. Messenger, Senior Research Officer for the ILO’s Conditions of Work and Employment Programme and a co-author of the study.
“Tertiarization” – that is, the expanding service sector – and informal employment, two of the hallmarks of today’s global economy, are also major sources of longer working hours.
Working hours in the services sector and its subsectors tend to be the most varied, and these hours are particularly long in industries such as wholesale and retail trade, hotels and restaurants, and transport, storage and communications, all of which also commonly involve shift work and “unsocial” hours.
For instance, in Mexico a higher proportion of workers spend more than 48 hours per week on the job in the wholesale and retail trade than any other industry.
And in the security industry, which has among the longest legal hours of any industry, working hours in countries such as Jamaica have been estimated at 72 hours per week.
Attempts to reduce hours in developing countries have been unsuccessful for various reasons, including the need of workers to work long hours simply to make ends meet, and the widespread use of overtime by employers in an effort to increase their enterprises’ output under conditions of low productivity.
While promotion of working time flexibility is often proposed as an alternative to long working hours in policy documents, these measures are not much used in practice in these countries.
Laws and policies on working time have a limited influence on actual working hours in developing economies, especially in terms of maximum weekly hours, overtime payments, and their effect on hours worked in informal employment.
Preserving workers’ health and workplace safety is a basic goal of working time policies.
Reducing long working hours lessens the risk of occupational injuries and illnesses, and their associated costs to workers, employers, and society as a whole.
Laws and regulations that establish limits on working hours, such as the 48-hour limits in the Hours of Work Conventions, Nos.
1 and 30, and the 40-hour limit in the Forty-Hour Week Convention (No.
47), are a necessary minimum condition for restraining excessively long hours of work.
But as legal limits alone are unlikely to be sufficient, there also needs to be a credible enforcement mechanism, such as the labour inspectorate, as well as compliance with the established “norms” among enterprises.
Long working hours and overtime work are often used to compensate workers for low wages in developing and transition economies.
Attention to wage policies, and in particular to minimum wages, can thus make an important contribution towards breaking the vicious circle of low pay and long hours.
The promotion of part-time work as a work-family measure is an important issue in this regard.
The flexibility to combine paid labour with non-market work is one reason why informal work is so favoured by women.
In the formal sector of developing economies part-time work is still relatively rare, mostly due to the low wage levels which make it infeasible for most workers.
Moreover, the experience of industrialized countries suggests that the provision of part-time employment alone is not sufficient, and that there is also a need for the availability of high-quality part-time positions across all jobs and occupations, as well as allowing for smooth transitions between shorter and longer hours.
Excessive hours tend to be not only unhealthy and unsafe, but unproductive as well.
Reasonable statutory hours limits can provide an incentive for firms to modernize their working time arrangements and to invest in improving their equipment and technology and in enhancing the skills of their workforce.
But as long working hours and low wages are often linked, efforts to reduce working hours, if carried out without addressing low wages, can easily result in avoidance of the law and/or an increase in multiple job-holding among workers.
Improved productivity should go hand in hand with reduced working hours and higher hourly wages.
It is therefore necessary to encourage and assist enterprises to improve their productivity through providing workplace training to both managers and workers, including on how to improve the planning and management of working time and workloads.
Reductions in working hours can play a role in advancing the influence workers have on their schedules by allowing them a greater degree of choice over how they divide their time.
Working time flexibility measures need to be tailored towards balancing flexibility with protection, through means like absolute maximums on the hours worked per week, advance notice periods, and measures towards individual influence, such as the right to refuse to work on traditional rest days.
Some individual choice measures are already in operation in developing economies, although they only appear in a few countries and firms.
The vast majority of governments and enterprises could introduce simple individual choice techniques, such as rights to notice of when overtime will be required; choice regarding whether and when to work overtime hours (“voluntary overtime”); consultation on starting and finishing times; and even flexi-time schemes.
On December 19, 2008, the Department of Labor published a final rule Labor Certification Process and Enforcement: Temporary Employment in Occupations Other Than Agriculture or Registered Nursing in the United States (H-2B Workers), and Other Technical Changes.
While the rule primarily focuses on amending the regulations to modernize the H-2B program for temporary non-agricultural employment of aliens in the United States, the "other technical changes" include a number of provisions changing the way prevailing wage determinations (PWDs) are done for PERM, H-1B, H-1B1, and E-3.
The rule transfers prevailing wage determination functions from local State Workforce Agencies (SWAs) to the a DOL National Processing Center (NPC).
While employers still place a job order with the SWA serving the area of intended employment, the employer will now submit a new national "Prevailing Wage Determination Request" (PWDR) to the appropriate NPC to obtain a PWD.
For the H-1B, H-1B1, E-3 and PERM programs, the SWA having jurisdiction over the area of intended employment will continue to receive and process prevailing wage determination requests until December 31, 2009.
On and after January 1, 2010, employers will be required to obtain prevailing wage determination requests for the H-1B, H-1B1, E-3 and PERM programs from the National Prevailing Wage and Helpdesk Center (NPWHC).
A December, 4, 2009 DOL notice published in the Federal Register provides more details about the transition.
Read the DOL notice, and NAFSA's Practice Advisory on Centralized Prevailing Wage Determinations , for more information.
Inequality is also deeply embedded in employment.
A notable feature of remuneration in South Africa is the marked inequality in earnings between those at the top and those at the bottom of particular enterprises.
In the public service, despite recent efforts to increase the minimum wage, the most senior civil servant still earns 20 times the salary of the lowest level employee.
And differences in the private sector are also substantial.
While it was difficult for the Commission to obtain detailed data, indications are that a typical mine manager earns more than 25 times what the lowest labourer earns; and even more if casual labour is included.
Differentials are probably higher than in most other countries, developed and developing.
These are a reflection on the one hand of structural, apartheid-based inequalities in access to education, training and jobs and the related shortages of skilled professional and managerial personnel, and on the other hand, of an overabundance of unskilled labour.
Wages are also determined through a variety of institutional mechanisms with differences depending on the industry, region and occupational categories involved.
Internationally, bargaining is commonly analysed at three major levels ­ national, industrial and enterprise ­ although in practice the picture is always more complex.
In South Africa there is no national-level cross-industry wage bargaining between trade union and employer federations.
Local and enterprise negotiations are widespread.
Beyond this there is a veritable patchwork of bargaining arrangements with dramatic differences between industries, companies and regions.
A number of industries ­ including clothing, textiles, auto, engineering, furniture, and recently the public service ­ have industry-level bargaining through industrial councils (to be known in future as "bargaining councils") or similar bodies.
This bargaining sometimes takes place at national level and sometimes in regional industrial councils.
Agreements vary in occupational and geographical scope, with minimum rates or actual increases or percentage increases generally extended to non-parties within the defined area of jurisdiction of the council.
Some bargaining councils accommodate supplementary plant-level bargaining through house agreements.
Others determine actual rates and discourage further enterprise-based bargaining.
No agreements cover the whole country; the former TBVC and SGT "border areas" such as Botshabelo or Dimbaza are generally excluded and in practice pay significantly lower wages.
This may change with the integration of labour law.
In some industries, notably construction, industry bargaining has been undermined by the increasing use of labour brokers, casuals and sub-contractors.
In construction differential conditions for casuals have been introduced recently in an attempt to regulate the situation.
In most of the service sector, transport and telecommunications, finances, and in large parts of manufacturing (such as food, printing, paper and chemicals) wages are determined largely through enterprise or company-level bargaining.
In some parts of these sectors, such as chemicals, security services and goods transport, industrial bargaining has recently emerged or is about to do so.
For those gold and coal operations organised by the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) or other unions active in the mining industry, and falling under the Chamber of Mines, an industry-level agreement provides the framework within which actual wages are negotiated at the company or mine-specific level.
The unevenness of institutional arrangements governing wage determination inhibits the possibility of co-ordinating labour market policy with industrial policy and macroeconomic policy.
However, this problem will not be confronted overnight by legislative edict.
It is the product of complex historical and social processes.
This Report will recommend that strong encouragement be given to sectoral bargaining as a mechanism for establishing minimum rates and conditions and that actual rates be established through enterprise-level bargaining.
The Commission believes that labour market policy, and this naturally includes the collective bargaining system, should reinforce the national goals of enhancing employment and productivity, and tackling poverty and inequality.
In doing so there are difficult policy choices to be made.
Poverty cannot be eliminated by legislative edict, nor can productivity be easily enhanced when extremely low wages are paid or when earnings inequalities are manifestly extreme.
There may be trade-offs between promoting greater equity and industrial peace for those in employment and increasing access to employment by those without jobs.
The Commission's recommendations in relation to wage determination are intended to be practical and incremental, balancing the various goals of post-apartheid development policy.
The Commission recommends that collective bargaining be promoted.
We accept the framework of the new LRA which encourages bargaining at both industry and at enterprise (or company) level.
The new labour law envisages an increased role for industry-level bargaining councils.
The Department of Labour should encourage these and, if necessary, facilitate the establishment of such councils in industries where they do not exist.
It should also support moves aimed at rationalising the bargaining system.
Bargaining councils can play a vital role not only in determining minimum wages and conditions and promoting industrial relations stability, but also in building consensus around longer-term training and industry policy needs and in developing appropriate economies of scale for the administration of various benefit funds.
Importantly they can enhance certainty by establishing defined standards.
The new labour law envisages a role for NEDLAC and the social partners in demarcating industries.
In this chapter, as in common South African usage, the terms "industry" and "sector" are used interchangeably.
This imposes an obligation to discuss the type of industry-level bargaining arrangements envisaged.
The Commission believes a number of principles should inform a rational approach to demarcation.
First, the aim should be to bring together in one bargaining forum broadly similar producers or service providers.
The product market must be assessed to ensure that the industry scope is neither too broad nor too narrow.
Second, it is particularly important to take into account the labour-intensity of the component parts of the industry to ensure that the same minimum conditions do not automatically apply to vastly different situations, possibly acting to discourage job creation Third, account should be taken of the actual or planned structure of training arrangements in the industry concerned.
Fourth, the number of employees covered should be sufficiently large to allow economies of scale in relation to, for example, benefit funds, while not being too large such that sub-sectors with little in common are bunched together.
The new LRA allows the extension of agreements by the Minister to non-parties.
The extension of agreements aims to ensure that all employers are bound by collective agreements reached in representative bargaining councils and/or where extensions are needed to encourage more stable and representative sectoral bargaining.
The Minister should treat applications for extension with circumspection and exercise caution in extending agreements where there are grounds for concern that significant job destruction might ensue.
The Commission believes the approach contained in the new LRA needs to be carefully monitored.
The LRA virtually obliges the Minister to extend an agreement reached by over 50% of the industry, but discourages him from extending agreements where this threshold is not met.
The Commission recommends that the Minister should have greater discretion in deciding whether or not to extend agreements.
The Minister should take less account of the representivity of the parties to the agreement and more account of whether the agreement reached is sensitive to the problems of non-parties and the job-creating goals of the RDP.
This means the Minister should also consider extending agreements reached in less representative councils if these criteria are met.
The debate over extensions is largely associated with government policy in support of labour-intensive production in general and small business in particular.
The Commission believes there are four basic options for dealing with the special problems faced by small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
One approach involves exempting firms below a certain size from all minimum standards and collective agreements.
However this would run counter to the trend of establishing one legal framework for all employees and employers, would effectively limit the basic labour rights of a significant section of the workforce, and is an approach rejected by the Commission.
A second approach involves the extension of collective agreements to all employers and employees in the industry regardless of firm size.
This is the current practice and individual SMEs wanting exemptions can thereafter apply to a bargaining council.
Currently some bargaining councils grant exemptions relatively easily, but others do not.
In practice many small enterprises simply evade the regulatory net or break the applicable minimum standards.
A third approach is to have only a simple, minimalist agreement (or no agreement) at industry level, leaving it to enterprise bargaining to top up low minima.
A fourth approach involves setting a simpler, less onerous schedule of minimum conditions for SMEs.
In general the Commission favours the fourth option since it realistically acknowledges the different circumstances of many SMEs and the dualism within the labour market, but simultaneously keeps all employers within a basic, regulatory net.
Importantly, this approach recognises that we have one basic labour law covering all workers and employers.
Public support for small business by state agencies should be linked to these businesses complying, or being assisted to comply, with basic labour standards.
These would include the minimum wage rates and basic conditions established by the relevant bargaining council, wage determination or other law.
Similar considerations should form part of the state's procurement policies.
As the law provides, bargaining councils and the Ministry of Labour are responsible for enforcing agreements and wage determinations.
In doing so, two points should be taken into account.
First, sanctions and inspections should be considered only on receipt of a complaint regarding breach of standards from the employees concerned.
Unions may help such employees to draft their complaint.
This is a significant departure from current practice and aims to prevent either workers or employers in competitor establishments from initiating an essentially protective action.
Second, the focus should be placed on facilitating employer compliance with minimum standards.
Punitive measures should only be considered as a last resort.
Where clear job destruction possibilities can be anticipated it is preferable to encourage a negotiated and incremental application of minimum standards.
Wherever possible this should be done by facilitating agreements between the employer/s and the workers concerned.
New approaches to enforcement require appropriate training and retraining for bargaining council agents and Department of Labour inspectors.
Knowledge of conciliation techniques and possible wage-employment-training trade-offs is essential.
The Commission's support for sectoral bargaining and structured flexibility in the application of agreements requires strong, representative unions and employer organisations.
These are essential for a stable industrial relations system.
The Commission recommends that the Department of Labour give financial support to a trade union-controlled education and training institute aimed at improving the skills of unionists, including shop stewards.
Evidence before the Commission suggests that some employer organisations are weak, underfunded and play a limited role in industrial relations.
The new LRA encourages, and its success is heavily dependant on, the formation of strong employer associations.
At present employer associations generally perform limited representative roles in terms of advice and annual negotiations.
The Commission believes it is essential for these associations to expand their operations to include the representation of members, assisting members with conciliation and arbitration conducted under the new LRA, HRD planning and providing much of the advice on dispute resolution procedures, recognition agreements and Workplace Forums which is currently provided by consultants.
Some sectoral employer associations find it difficult obtaining membership from the small businesses community.
When employer associations become dominated by the larger business concerns, the danger looms that they will be insufficiently sensitive to the interests of small business.
Although the new LRA makes provision for the representation of small business on bargaining councils, employer associations should make a special effort to recruit small business.
Employer associations on bargaining councils should also appoint a small business co-ordinator to improve the quantity and quality of small business participation.
The Commission recommends that bargaining councils agree to a modest industry-wide levy on all employers within its jurisdiction to be used to achieve the above objectives.
Government should also consider providing financial and other resources to these programmes.
The recently established Small Business Council (SBC) established under the auspices of the Department of Trade and Industry is to be welcomed and could be approached by employer organisations to identify small business counterparts in their sectors.
The Wage Act was introduced in 1925 as a companion to the Industrial Conciliation Act.
It established a Wage Board, a body appointed by the Minister to make recommendations on the determination of minimum wages and working conditions.
The original aim was to provide a minimum floor predominantly for white workers in those sectors and areas where there were no industrial councils.
As documented in the ILO Review, the Wage Board currently sets minimum wages and other basic minimum conditions for approximately 730 000 workers, including both unionised and non-unionised employees.
In practice the Board has become less active in recent years.
Its coverage has decreased, its determinations are generally updated infrequently, the minima it sets are usually low, and determinations are rarely enforced by the Department of Labour's inspectorate.
There are no minimum determinations in the lowest paying sectors ­ agriculture and domestic service.
The Basic Conditions of Employment Act (BCEA) stipulates the minimum conditions of employment for the economy as a whole excluding the public service.
Conditions covered include hours of work, overtime pay, Sunday work, annual leave, sick leave and public holidays.
These conditions are fairly rigid in their formulation although the Act provides for variations in three ways.
First, an exemption may be given through an administrative procedure handled by the Department of Labour.
Second, a promulgated collective agreement concluded by an industrial council can trump the BCEA.
Third, to the extent that a Wage Board determination deals with matters falling under the BCEA, these also trump the Act.
Minimum wages were strongly supported by organised labour.
One farmworkers union reported on the poor wage and living conditions faced by farmworkers and called for a minimum of R750 p.m. The union argued that minima would need to be varied by sub-sector (crop) and accepted both the phasing-in of minima and the need for some type of exemption system.
The major mineworkers' union called for a national minimum targeting the bottom 10% of workers and argued for a minimum of R650 p.m. A domestic workers' union spokesperson complained not only of low wages (and even instances of no wages) but also of long working hours, child labour, sexual harassment, payment in kind and the general lack of employment contracts.
She called for a minimum of R600 p.m., conceding that it could lead to some job loss.
Two major union federations declined to put a figure to their minimum wage call, stating that any determination should take into account both the need to end exploitation and the need to maintain macroeconomic balance.
In general they stressed the need to avoid sweatshops and argued that any minimum wage should be used to reinforce collective bargaining.
Setting minimum wages and conditions can prevent socially unacceptable levels of exploitation.
Practices such as child labour, unfree labour, and pitiful wages and working conditions must be legislated against.
They have no future in a democratic society.
Wage costs at the low end of the spectrum are only one component, and often a small component, of total production costs.
In agriculture, for example, total wage costs (including both low-paid and high-paid employees) comprised only 21% of total costs on average in 1995.
The Commission believes the Wage Board should set minimum wages and working conditions in sectors (or parts of sectors) where no effective collective bargaining exists.
The setting of minimum conditions should not be used as a substitute for collective bargaining.
Indeed minimum standard setting should facilitate the transition to collective bargaining wherever possible.
There may be scope, at some future point, for the social partners to agree at national level on the parameters of national and regional wage policy, and on a national minimum wage.
This is discussed elsewhere in the context of the Accord for Employment and Growth.
The Wage Board should be the instrument for recommending appropriate minimum wages and working conditions.
These should be forwarded to the Minister of Labour for approval prior to being gazetted.
The Minister should gazette all recommendations timeously or publicise his/her reasons for not doing so.
The Commission does not wish to make detailed recommendations regarding the structure and operations of the Wage Board, other than making a few general points and observations.
The existing Board needs to be modified and modernised in a number of respects.
Its scope should include all sectors of the economy, although in practice it would not operate where effective collective bargaining exists.
And since it deals with wages and working conditions, the Commission endorses the proposal in the Green Paper on Employment Standards to consolidate the Basic Conditions of Employment Act and the Wage Act into one piece of legislation, and to give the Board a more appropriate name.
It is not envisaged that minimum conditions should apply to highly skilled, managerial and professional employees, or those earning above a specified income.
These employees can rely on individual or collective bargaining to protect their interests.
The Wage Board should consist of full-time members appointed by the Minister, after consultation with NEDLAC.
Appointment criteria would need to include some or all of the following ­ economic and social policy expertise, ability to communicate in a number of official languages, and an appropriate degree of independence from unions and employer organisations.
There may, however, be a need for variations in wages and conditions to be contained within specific Wage Board determinations.
Here too the Commission does not make detailed recommendations.
However it is advisable for legislation (through a revised Basic Conditions of Employment Act) to define the broad categories of non-variable minima and variable minima.
Non-variable minima might include a ban on child labour, prohibiting forced overtime work, setting minimum premiums for overtime hours, or ensuring that basic safety standards are adhered to.
Variable minima might involve setting the parameters of certain conditions but leaving the details to negotiations at enterprise (plant) level.
These might include limited, but meaningful, regulation of part-time and casual employees.
They might involve lower wage minima for certain categories of enterprises or for trainees especially young trainees, or to regulate basic conditions of short-term workers on public works programmes.
Domestic workers also find it difficult to negotiate their terms and conditions.
This sector is comprised overwhelmingly of black women who generally deal with their employers on an individualised basis.
South Africa is estimated to have 874 000 domestic workers employed predominantly in white households but also, increasingly, in black households.
Their conditions vary markedly and appear to depend heavily on the income of the employer, with those working in wealthier suburbs generally earning more.
Many domestic workers live on the premises but are often not allowed to have their children or partners visit them.
Many receive some payment in kind, often in the form of food or rations.
Hours of work are frequently long and the span of hours where the domestic worker is expected to be present is often excessive.
Overtime hours are common although overtime pay is rare.
removing almost all restrictions on issuing work permits to skilled non-citizen personnel;
removing current veto powers on the issuing of work permits which many professional associations still have;
The labour rights complaints process in Cambodia distinguishes between individual and collective disputes.
For individual disputes, there is a conciliation process through the Ministry of Labour and Vocational Training (MOLVT), followed by the option of taking the case to court if parties do not come to a settlement.
Collective disputes are handled by the Arbitration Council—an independent body whose function is to resolve collective labour disputes that could not be resolved by MOLVT conciliation.
The Arbitration Council has a tripartite structure comprised of members nominated by unions, employer associations and the MOLVT.
The Council currently has 30 members appointed annually by the Minister of Labour.
Individual disputes: complaints can relate to the “interpretation or enforcement of the terms of a labour contract or apprenticeship contract, or the provisions of a collective agreement as well as regulations or laws in effect.”
Collective disputes: MOLVT is responsible for forwarding non-conciliated disputes to the Arbitration Council which, in turn, evaluates admissibility (i.e., whether the case meets the criteria of collective disputes laid out in the labour law).
The Arbitration Council can only hear two types of issues: those specified in the Non-Conciliation Report and those arising from events occurring after the Report that are a direct consequence of the dispute Note: The standards are based on Cambodian Labour Law (1997) or an applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement between employers and workers groups, and as such focus particularly on labour rights.
Cambodia has ratified the eight International Labour Organization (ILO) Core Conventions, but Cambodian labour law has not been amended to reflect the subsequent ratifications.
The law has strong provisions with regard to freedom of association, collective bargaining and trade union rights, but it is less robust on child labour and discrimination.
Certain working conditions are very detailed (such as leave and dismissals); others are less so (e.g.
Occupational Safety and Health).
Conciliation process: the designated Conciliator (from the Labour Inspectorate) will try to help the parties resolve their dispute by agreement.
The Labour Inspectorate will set a hearing to take place within 3 weeks of receipt of the complaint.
The parties are required to provide information requested by the Conciliator and to attend the meetings called by the Conciliator.
Regardless of whether the conciliation is successful, the Conciliator must write and sign a report on the conciliation.
Each party also signs the report and receives a certified copy.
The report is then submitted to the Minister.
Stage 2: Arbitration: If the conciliation fails, the conciliator submits a Non-Conciliation Report to the Minister of Labour, noting the unresolved issues.
The dispute must then go to an arbitration procedure as set out either in an applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement or in Cambodia’s Labour Law, or to another procedure agreed by the parties.
Disputes that go to arbitration are heard by a three-person panel of the Arbitration Council.
Overturning the Collective Agreement that had been legally in force until 2012, the Madrid local government imposed a 5% wage cut on the Metro workers, which was in line with that imposed by the Zapatero government on all civil servants (so much for the difference between the ‘Left’ and the right which so many talk about).
Independently of whether the wage cut was large or small, the struggle arose, precisely, from the unilateral breaking of the Collective Agreement, which meant breaking the traditional collective negotiations over working conditions, and replacing it with case by case negotiations.
When it was decided to call the strike, the Municipality tried to limit the strike by obliging the strikers to maintain 50% of the Metro services.
The workers, in an act of unprecedented courage, took the decision in their assembly not to respect the demand for minimum service.
On the 29th and 30th June Madrid was without a Metro.
Although the Ministry of the Interior deployed thousands of police, the pickets were successful, despite the traps of the bosses and Madrid municipality, in ensuring that no trains ran.
The campaign of harassment and wrecking by both the media and the different bourgeois organisations and parties spread demoralisation amongst the striking workers, leading to their submission to the pressure exerted by the government departments and media.
This explains why the latest mobilisations have respected the unfair minimum services.
The bosses did sit down at the negotiating table on the 10th July but there is still no agreement and 2000 disciplinary proceedings are in place due to breach of minimum service during the 29th and 30th June.
The 5% pay cut has been reduced to 1.5%, but the reprimanded workers will stay reprimanded and the Collective Agreement will be a thing of the past.
The Madrid workers strike was an example.
An example for workers throughout Spain.
The consciousness of class unity and solidarity were stronger than the symbols of the unions, allowing the creation of organs of collective struggle despite the confluence of conflicting tendencies.
It reappropriated the method par excellence of workers' organisation: sovereign assemblies, germs of the future workers' councils; where the workers expressed themselves and took decisions, real organs of workers' democracy.
It also directly confronted the attack on workers’ right to strike, going beyond maintaining a minimum service and expressing the real nature of a strike, which can only have an impact when economic activity or services are paralysed.
Just for the moment.
Because there was not this support and solidarity strikes did not happen, the Metro workers were left feeling guilty and real criminals and soon bowed to the demand for minimum service which only served to stifle the protests and leave them with no impact.
Due to this the movement lost strength and was not able to regain the initial conditions of the Collective Agreement.
We can see that the movement in Madrid came to nothing, but we must not be discouraged.
Madrid is only a small step in recovering the best traditions of workers' struggle in this new period of the resurgence of proletarian combativity.
The United Workers' Front defended by the CREE has found expression in this struggle without the need to call for it.
This encourages us to continue working because we are going in the right direction.
Here we give our support to the workers of the Madrid Metro, who have given a first and very important lesson to the working class about how one day to confront the bourgeois social order.
No.
Casual workers are not considered as employees of the department/agency nor are they employees of the federal public service.
They are not considered employees under the Public Service Labour Relations Act (PSLRA).
Casual workers are paid at the minimum rate of the applicable pay scale for the group and level assigned to the requirements of the job, in accordance with the TB Directive on Terms and Conditions of Employment (Part 2 of the Appendix, section 2.1).
18.
Can casual workers be paid above the minimum of the pay scale?
Casual workers are not entitled to earn annual leave credits or to vacation leave with pay.
Instead, as stated in Part 4 of the TB Directive on Terms and Conditions of Employment , casual workers are paid 4 per cent vacation pay on all hours worked, including overtime hours.
22.
Are casual workers covered by the collective agreements?
No.
Casual workers are not covered by the collective agreements.
However, certain portions of the relevant collective agreement apply, for example, overtime and compensation for work on a designated holiday is paid in accordance with the relevant collective agreement, or sick leave credits are granted in accordance with the relevant collective agreement.
The TB Terms and Conditions of Employment Policy and Directive apply to casual workers.
Paid sick leave is not granted to a casual worker.
The casual worker earns sick leave credits, as prescribed in the relevant collective agreement; however, these sick leave credits cannot be granted but remain in the casual worker's leave account for future use.
29.
Are casual workers eligible to receive remuneration for overtime?
Casual workers are most often hired as short-term replacements for staff and to help manage heavy workloads.
At the more senior levels, casuals are used to bring in an expertise in order to support a special project or to transfer knowledge.
Many times the skill set of a former federal public service employee are the ideal skills needed to support a special project, or the individual has key knowledge that would benefit federal public servants.

Companies employing less than 10 employees which suffer economic difficulties have the possibility to request to be exempted from this share of indemnity.
This request must be filed with the commission which approves the company plans in case of "an individual temporary reduction of working time scheme" or "a temporary and collective, total or partial suspension of the execution of the employment contract scheme" (see newsletter of May 2009 ).
If this commission approves the request, the Unemployment Office will pay the total indemnity.

These measures relate to the reduction of working time and aim at avoiding dismissals.
1.
Collective temporary reduction of working time
If parties entered into a collective bargaining agreement regarding the reduction of working time in the course of 2009 and the employer wishes to prolong this scheme, a new collective bargaining agreement will have to be entered into.

Individual temporary reduction of working time
A company without trade union delegation enters into an agreement with all employees and the company proves that there were negotiations with all its employees.
The request to pay a lower amount than 5 EUR must be approved by the Commission for Company Plans;
For companies with or without trade union delegation, the Commission for Company Plans can agree with a lower amount to be paid when it finds that this is justified.
This decision must be taken unanimously.
Evidence from Malaysia, Mexico, Turkey, Lesotho, Egypt and many other countries shows that a negative link between globalization and basic workers' rights exists.
Instead of being a source of wealth for improving living conditions, trade has too often resulted in governments lowering workers' rights standards in order to minimize labor costs.
Many countries are relying more and more on an export model of development which is based on exploitation and increased competition with other countries.
Governments have introduced export-processing zones where unions are not usually tolerated.
That keeps working conditions dangerous and wages low, especially for the women who make up 80 percent of the work-force in the zones.
Developing countries have charged industrialized countries with trying to remove their comparative advantages by introducing binding labor standards.
From the viewpoint of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) however, two thirds of whose affiliates come from developing countries, the inclusion of core labor standards in the WTO is not a question of protecting markets but of protecting workers' basic rights worldwide.
Core labor standards are fundamental workers' rights.
Within trade unions, there is tremendous support for linking workers' rights and trade.
The only exceptions are the Indian trade unions.
95% or more of the trade unions from developing countries, including South Africa, Brazil, Malaysia, the Philippines and Korea support linking the issues.
The Indian unions are afraid of protectionism from the North.
We have made it very clear that when taking steps against the negative effects of trade on workers' rights, protectionist risks cannot be accepted.
In the unions, ptotectionism has not been on anyone's mind.
The debate should be shifted away from protectionism towards a debate between democratic countries committed to human rights and dictatorships that use labor standards as a device for global competition.
First of all, I agree that a law can provide a basis, but laws must be introduced at a domestic level, where issues are more clearly understood.
Secondly, the majority of workers are working in the domestic and not in the export sector.
If labor standards were imposed on domestic workers as well, unemployment would rise and working conditions would deteriorate.
Finally, if the export sector is found guilty of violating workers' rights, then corruption and forgery of documents will increase.
We don't want to increase either unemployment or corruption.
The matter demands a closer look from the ICFTU-led trade union brigade and the AFL-CIO bosses, so they can better understand the situation, rather than continuing to bray for a social clause in the WTO agreements which will deny the poor countries their chance of economic development.
Leading employment lawyers are advising UK companies to adopt techniques imported from the US for keeping unions out of the workplace before new trade union rights recognition came into force on June 6.
The Trade Union Congress rightly criticized the initiative, but it should hit at the root of the problem: attack AFL-CIO for its tardy organization in the US, where only 12 percent of the workers are unionized.
Their right to strike is also nullified by the right of employers to hire alternative workers.
Notwithstanding its failure to prevent the US Congress approving the China deal, the AFL-CIO needs to consider the problems workers will face in the sunset industries such as textiles and clothing in the US.
Quite fairly Stephen Byers, UK trade and industry minister, decided not to intervene over the 60,000 job losses in the UK’s textile industry that resulted from Marks and Spencer buying clothes from overseas.
After all, the quota ridden Agreement on Textiles and Clothing requires all wealthy countries to structurally adjust their textile industry so the more competitive developing countries can prosper.
And when they prosper, their workers will, not through a social clause.
Pradeep Mehta (‘Social clause is a Blind Alley’, letters, June 3) takes such wild and irrelevant pot-shots at trade unions that most of those attacks do not merit a response.
However his unsupported assertion that developing countries and their workers would be losers if there were a way of ensuring respect for basic workers’ rights in the trading system needs rebutting.
On the contrary, developing countries who want to protect the fundamental rights of workers and their families in a globalising world economy are precisely the ones that are suffering the most right now, as they face intensifying competition from all countries like China which violate all internationally recognized core labour standards.
As evidenced by the numerous examples presented in the preceding chapters, there currently exists a very large variety of provisions in major Canadian collective agreements which are conducive to the balancing of work and family responsibilities.
Following are, briefly, a number of general conclusions that can be drawn from the review and analysis of contract clauses.
Clauses found in collective agreements sometimes outline only general principles and guidelines regarding particular workplace arrangements.
Specifics may have to be determined by the parties - usually by means of a joint union-management committee - outside the confines of the collective bargaining process.
Although language in collective agreements often mimics labour standards, there is still substantial room for employers and unions to innovate by providing arrangements and benefits that are not covered by legislation.
There often appears to be a recognition among negotiating parties that there is a need to go further than legislative requirements.
This demonstrates that the collective bargaining process still has an important role to play in the establishment of family-friendly practices in the workplace.
Several clauses that are designed to help employees with family responsibilities can also benefit other workers in achieving greater work-life balance.
Flexible schedules and leave for personal reasons are cases in point.
In this sense, the interests of employees with and those without family obligations are not always opposed: they may even be congruous.
This means that attempts by unions and employers to improve the working conditions of employees with family responsibilities should not be viewed as a zero-sum game, where gains by this group are made at the expense of another.
There can sometimes be a gulf between what is available on paper in a collective agreement and an organization’s culture.
An employer with few, or no, official work and family policies may still be responsive to the needs of its employees, through supportive management and informal practices.
Correspondingly, even the most "family-friendly" clause can be meaningless if employees are reluctant to avail themselves of it, for fear of retribution from managers or co-workers.
The tangible effects of family-friendly provisions on an employer’s bottom line would also be a fecund area of inquiry.
1994 Equal pay for work of equal value (Commission opinion)
FedEE provides a practical HR resource for companies operating internationally across Europe, with a focus on employment law, pay and labour relations.
First established with EU funding in 1989, it is now a rapidly-growing independent organisation serving the needs of multinational employers worldwide.
Under Law No.
92-1446, 31 December 1992 (Journal Officiel, 11 January 1993), new and significant measures have been passed to promote part-time work.
The most important provision is the introduction of a regulation governing the reduction in social-security contributions for unlimited, part-time working contracts, or where full-time jobs are transformed into part-time work.
The conditions for the introduction of part-time work at the request of the employee are determined by the relevant sectoral or other collective agreement.
- the conditions under which he/she receives priority where a part-time job is vacant and where he/she desires to return to full-time employment;
The transformation of a permanent employment contract at full working hours into a permanent, part-time employment contract can only occur with the express agreement of the employee concerned.
The distribution of working time under the contract must be stipulated, in terms of either weekly or monthly working time.
The parties to the contract have the option of changing the pattern of working hours.
The conditions to which such a change is subject are to be determined either in the original contract or with reference to a collective agreement.
The employee must receive at least three working days notice of any such changes.
Additional working hours are all those worked in excess of the number of hours stipulated in the part-time contract.
Additional hours, which must also be mentioned in the contract, may not exceed one tenth of the contractually agreed weekly or monthly working hours.
This figure can, however, be extended to a maximum of one third via collective agreement.
Refusal to work additional hours beyond these limits is neither in breach of contract not does it constitute a ground for dismissal.
Additional working hours are not subject to overtime bonus payments.
Total weekly working time, including the additional hours, must not exceed 39 hours, or the collectively agreed standard working week.
In cases where the request comes from employees, the motives which can be cited by the employer as grounds for refusing such a request must be listed in the relevant collective agreement.
- in firms with more than 10 employees, to seek the opinion of the works council or employee representatives and to pass the opinion expressed to the labour inspectorate within 15 days;
- in firms with less than 10 employees, merely to inform the labour inspectorate.
The opinion expressed by workers' representatives is purely consultative in nature and in no way binds the employer (except where the relevant collective agreement stipulates otherwise).
At the same time, failure to consult representatives of the workforce on the introduction of part-time work can be sanctioned by law.
Following the introduction of part-time work, management is obliged to draw up an annual report on the part-time work performed within the firm and to present the results to the works council or other worker representatives and to the enterprise's trade union delegates.
Specifically, this report must contain details of the number, sex and qualification of the employees affected.
In addition the employer has also to state the reasons given for the refusal to transform a full-time into a part-time, or a part-time into a full-time job.
Employers offering part-time employment to their employees benefit via a reduction in their contributions to the social-security system.
This reduction is designed to compensate for the increased costs resulting from the fact that the same volume of work is divided among a number of part-time workers.
- to consult employee representatives before introducing part-time work.
If no elected workforce representation exists, the employer must consult the labour inspectorate;
Workers in part-time employment enjoy, in principle, equal legal rights to those working full-time.
1.
The employer is obliged to inform workers who have indicated their wish to work part time or to return to full-time employment of any suitable vacancies which arise, by providing each one with a list of jobs conforming to the worker's intentions as they become vacant.
Length of tenure: Tenure begins with the first day's work performed by an employee, irrespective of whether he/she was hired directly as a part-time worker or his/her employment contract was transformed into a part-time employment relation.
With one exception, part-time workers involuntarily losing their job are entitled to exactly the same benefits from the unemployment-insurance scheme as full-time workers: the fixed share of the unemployment benefit is paid out in proportion to the individual contributions paid in.
Termination of the employment contract: Refusal by a worker to work part time constitutes neither a breach of contract nor a justification for dismissal.
Termination of a part-time employment contract is subject to the same notice periods as for full-time workers.
The same is true of compensation payments in cases of redundancy and retirement (the reference wage is average gross earnings of the last three months' employment).
Calculating the total number of employees in a firm: Part-time employees are included in calculations of a firm's total workforce by dividing the total number of working hours contained in the various part-time employment contracts by the statutory or standard number of working hours.
Accrediting of working hours for worker-representation responsibilities: The monthly working hours of a part-time worker can be reduced by up to one third to cover the time required to exercise his/her mandate(s) within the enterprise.
Any additional hours which may be required must be remunerated by the employer, but be performed by the worker in question outside his/her working hours.
If we analyse the details of the number of workers who die because of work, quite surprisingly most of them die due to occupational cancers and other work related diseases (see the chart).
This is contrary to the common belief that work-related deaths are mostly caused by accidents.
In fact at most workplaces occupational safety and health safety (OSH) invariably means prevention of accidents.
An accident-free workplace by no means implies a safe workplace.
According to the ILO “[n]o country in the world records and compensates all work-related diseases”.
Some countries have good systems for reporting accidents.
The situation is worst in developing countries where even accident reporting is not proper, not to mention occupational diseases.
Most often official statistics are only the tip of the iceberg and no one knows how many workers actually die of work-related accidents and diseases.
Injured and diseased workers are often thrown out of their jobs and never appear in official statistics.
Occupational diseases, including cancers caused by various factors at the workplace, including asbestos, carcinogenic (cancer causing) chemicals, various dusts (silica, cotton etc), radiation, job stress, and shift work, usually take a long time to develop (from a few months to more than 20 years).
Given changing work practices, most industries tend to hire workers on short-term contracts and by the time they develop a disease, it is almost impossible to link it with their work.
Non–communicable diseases cause more deaths than communicable diseases, except in Africa.
Overall, people are more likely to die of work-related diseases than childhood or infectious diseases.
Ideally a safer workplace environment would be ensured by good preventive and compensation legislation under a good legal system (labour courts etc.
), a good state regulatory authority (mostly factory inspectorate), proper medical research to deal with new occupational diseases and situations, trained doctors in OSH, and above all the involvement of workers and trade unions.
A strong trade union is the most important factor for the improvement of health and safety at the workplace.
The injured and diseased workers are simply ignored.
Even in developed countries like Australia, workers receive only a part of the wage when they are sick or injured.
Workers are penalised for getting sick or injured.
In developing countries compensation for injuries involves a cumbersome procedure and most applicants give up as it is expensive and with no income they stand no chance against the might of capital which can buy companies the best lawyers to mock the system compared to workers who can hardly afford a lawyer.
Moreover, there are few doctors who can correctly diagnose an occupational disease and in communities where having a doctor is a privilege, having an OSH specialist is simply out of the question.
We must realise the gravity of the situation and stop these cold-blooded murders at the workplace.
Workers cannot be used as mere fodder for industrial growth.
Development should not come at a price of workers’ lives or limbs.
The ILO has many conventions related to safety at work yet none of them appear in its eight core conventions; it is high time for the ILO to put OSH on the list of core priorities.
Trade unions hold the key, and even though many of them have started to take this issue seriously much more needs to be done.
Trade unions need to make OSH their foremost priority and not just an optional issue after issues like wages etc.
Bargaining agreements should include provisions for better working conditions and this should not mean only, as generally happens, a demand for personal protective equipment.
Removal of hazards from the workplace should be the demand.
No worker should be exposed to hazards.
These are tough times for unions as neo-liberal forces are bent on reducing their membership and changing employment relations in a way to make unions redundant.
It is difficult to talk about OSH in these times when management often threatens to shift production rather than invest in safety.
However it cannot be ignored, in fact it may be used as a tool for organising.
In a time when we are looking for new ways to organise, workers’ health and safety may hold the key.

The European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) has instituted an award in order to honour the outstanding and most dynamic scientific work and its high relevance for the European trade union movement of the late Labour Law Professor Brian Bercusson: the ETUC – Brian Bercusson Award.
With this Award, the ETUC and the European Trade Union Institute (ETUI) support academic research that deepen understanding of and promote transnational workers’ rights in Europe.
The focus on European Labour Law shall raise awareness about new scientific research in academia as well as among practitioners in the European Union in order to encourage scientific, legal and political actions towards the further development, full recognition and better implementation of trade union- and workers’ rights.
This year’s European Panel conference, organized by the Hans-Böckler and Friedrich-Ebert Foundations and the ETUI in cooperation with the German and European Trade Union Confederations will take place on 14 and 15 September in Hotel Radisson Blu Royal in Brussels.
Distinguished speakers will focus on the EU2020 strategy of the European Commission and subsequent panels will look into questions such as: Is the EU’s Europe 2020 strategy laying the foundations not only for an economic recovery, but also for adequate employee participation?
How credible are the sustainability policies and what impacts are they expected to have on employment?
Are initiatives to reduce youth unemployment and precarious employment relationships likely to succeed despite the recession?
European Panel 2010 presents topics for future European debate and provides a forum for exchanging ideas with other participants from all over Europe.
The Lisbon Treaty and its impact on trade unions and workers’ rights
The impact of the Lisbon Treaty on Social Europe will very much depend on the political processes of the European and national institutions but also on the commitment of trade unions, workers’ representatives and citizens to influence such processes in order to defend their rights.
In this respect the ETUI organised a course for trade union representatives on ‘The Lisbon Treaty and its impact on trade unions and workers’ rights” which was held in Brussels on 8-9 July 2010.
25 participants representing 13 trade union confederations from 8 EU countries and the European Transport Workers’ Federation were offered the possibility to gain a better understanding of the Treaty and its impact on trade unions and workers’ rights, to become aware of the ETUC views on the Treaty, to exchange information about national trade union activities and to consider trade union strategies for multiplying national and sectoral activities on the Treaty.
Provisions stipulated in individual employment contracts, collective agreements, enterprise internal regulations or those established by custom and practice are valid if they are more favourable to the worker than the provisions of the LA (Article 5, LA).
As regards retirement, the employer has the right to terminate the employment of a worker who reaches sixty years of age, unless the contract is for a definite period of time and extends beyond this age.
In this case, the contract will be terminated on the date mentioned in the contract at the moment of its conclusion (Article 125, LA).
The termination of employment is not possible for reasons of the worker’s illness, unless he/she has exhausted sick leave entitlement as determined by the Social Insurance Law, in addition to his/her annual leave.
The employer has to notify the worker of the contemplated dismissal fifteen days before the end of the workers’ leave entitlement (Article 127, LA).
Termination of employment at the initiative of the employer
divulged professional secrets concerning the enterprise employing him/her, which caused serious damages to the enterprise;
two judges, of whom the senior judge is the chair of the committee according to the rules stipulated by the Judicial Authority Act;
a representative of the Federation of Egyptian Trade Unions; and
a member of a concerned employers’ organisation.
The LA lists some invalid reasons for dismissal, such as, among others, colour, sex, social status, family obligations, religion political views, participation in trade union activities, and filing a complaint against the employer (Article 120, LA).
In addition, the Trade Unions Act No.
35/1976 protects members of boards of trade unions from suspension or dismissal, except pursuant to a court decision (Articles 26, 27 and 46).
Any party willing to terminate the apprenticeship agreement has to give the other party notice of at least three days (Article 143, LA).
The employer may terminate the employment relationship if he/she considers that the apprentice lacks either the ability or the necessary inclination to learn the trade or occupation properly.
The Prime Minister defined, by Decree No.
984 of 2003, the composition of these committees, their powers and procedures.
Each committee must consist of a representative nominated by the General Federation of Egyptian Trade Unions, a representative of an employers’ organisation nominated by the concerned organisation, a technical and economic representative from the General Authority for Investment, and a representative from the National Social Insurance Authority.
The chair is the concerned director of the Manpower and Emigration Directorate.
The committee must prepare an argued decision, adopted by majority vote, within thirty days from the date of the submission of the request.
The employer must inform the workers and trade unions concerned about the request to the committee and the decision received from the committee (Article 198, LA).
If the collective agreement in force in the enterprise does not provide any objective criteria for selecting the workers to dismiss, the employer must consult with trade union representatives.
The criteria for selection must take into account the interests of both the enterprise and workers (Article 199, LA).
Employees retiring at the age of 60 are entitled to severance pay (Article 126, LA).
At the age of 60, a worker is entitled to indemnity calculated on the basis of half of his/her monthly wage for each of the first five years of employment, and one month’s wage for each subsequent year, unless he/she is entitled to benefits under the old-age, disability and death insurance scheme provided for by the Social Insurance Law.
In case of unjustified termination of employment, the worker is entitled to resort to the committee, established under Article 71 of the LA, for compensation.
Such compensation is determined by the committee, but cannot be less than the equivalent of two months’ wage for each year of service (Article 122, LA).
At the request of the workers whose dismissal was a result of trade union activities (Article 71, LA), the committee can order their reinstatement.
The burden of proving that the dismissal was due to other reasons rests on the employer.

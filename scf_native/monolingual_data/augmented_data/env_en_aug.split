We, the human species, have arrived at a moment of fateful decision.
It is unprecedented and in some ways even laughable to imagine that we could actually make a conscious choice as a species.
But that is nevertheless the challenge that now faces us because our home, Earth, is in danger.
What is at risk of being destroyed is of course not the planet itself but the conditions that have made it hospitable for human beings I will not dwell on the science but I want to state a few facts if only to underscore the urgency of our task.
We are, after all, in a process of negotiation with one another around the world but it's important to remind ourselves that we cannot negotiate with the facts.
We cannot negotiate with the truth about our situation.
We cannot negotiate with the consequences of unrestrained dumping of 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the thin shelf atmosphere surrounding our planet every 24 hours.
Scientists have for several years now warned us that we are moving dangerously close to several so-called tipping points that could within less than 10 years make it impossible to avoid irretrievable damage to the planet's habitability for human civilization unless we act quickly.
As many of you here know full well, in virtually all of the mountain ranges of this planet, the glaciers are now melting rapidly in the Alps in the Andes in the Rockies and most ominously in the Himalayas which contain number 100 times as much ice and snow of all of the mountains here in Europe.
The leading Chinese scientist who studies ice, professor Yao Tandong calls the Tibetan plateau the water tower of Asia.
As you know it feeds the great rivers of Asia, the Indus, the Ganges, the Brahmaputra, the Salween and the Irawati, the Mekong, the Yangtze and the Yellow.
1.4 billion people depend for more than half of their drinking water on the rivers and spring systems that flow from the ice of the Tibetan plateau which is now melting at an alarming rate.
Because the climate crisis has also increased the rate of soil moisture evaporation around the world and concentrated rainfall in shorter periods of time, shifting the seasons during which it falls, there is increased desertification and longer droughts, increasing stress on all of the people who live in the dry land regions of our world.
Many shallow lakes, including prominently lake Chad, have disappeared.
The Great Lakes of Africa are undergoing dramatic change, the Great Lakes of North America are losing their ice cover, and the water level is dropping dramatically.
Last year 2000 scientists gathered at the food and agriculture organization in Rome to discuss their fear of an impending crisis in the Mediterranean as it becomes saltier and as warmer water reaches its depths, threatening in the future to turn it into a stagnant sea if this process continues.
The dumping of 25 million tons of CO2 into the oceans of the world every day, and the increasing acidification of the ocean water along with rising temperature is putting stress on the ocean Fisheries throughout our planet.
And as you know, the warming ocean waters are also causing stronger typhoons and cyclones and hurricanes.
Typhoon Saomai was the strongest to hit China in more than 50 years, two of the three strongest histories in history hit south Asia within the last 3 years, one of them killing 20,000 people in Myanmar.
We have had such strong storms in North America as well, and in South America where Brazil had the first hurricane in recorded history.
Massive flooding has resulted at record rates on every continent.
Last year more than a dozen countries in Africa suffered the consequences of such flooding.
Last year Mexico had record flooding.
We have seen comparable events in Europe and throughout the world.
Heat waves continue.
Two winters ago was the hottest winter in the history of recorded atmospheric measurements.
20 of the 21 hottest years in recorded history have occurred in the last 25 years.
The university of Tel Aviv recently published a new study predicting that with each 1 degree increase in temperature there is a 10 percent increase in lightning, along with man-made causes, we are now seeing record fires as dryer soils and dryer vegetation leads to spreading fires in Greece, for example last year and in many other countries as well.
The extinction crisis is tearing at the fabric of the web of life, and the scientific consensus that we must take action was strengthened by the IPCC yet again earlier this year.
So the science is clear, and we are faced with a sharp contrast between two notional rates of change, first, the rate at which we are approaching a point of no return in terms of systems collapse, and second, the slower rate at which we have been addressing the problem of how to reduce the emissions that are causing this crisis.
We are moving up against a physical standard that doesn't give credit for a good try.
We will succeed or we will fail.
At every time of great challenge, we as human beings first of all must resolve a struggle in our own hearts between hope and fear.
That struggle is palpable here during this meeting at Poznan.
The causes for fear, pessimism, discouragement and doubt have been discussed in whispered conversations among the delegates here.
The global recession, we are told, makes the task of solving the climate crisis more difficult.
The businesses lobbies in the developed nations we are told have too much power and may divert leaders from their obligation to safeguard our future.
The prices for oil -- the prices for oil and coal have, in a cyclical and destructive pattern, once again risen to new highs in the first half of this year, contributing to the causes of the economic downturn, only then to once again plummet to levels that threaten to discourage investments necessary to develop renewable sources of energy and effective measures to improve conservation and efficiency.
We are also told that even though people throughout the world are more aware of the unprecedented threat posed by the climate crisis, many still seem not to feel the appropriate sense of urgency that should cause them to demand the emergency measures that the scientists have so clearly told us governments must take as quickly as possible.
The gap between rich and poor as we are all aware is not being closed with sufficient speed to build the unity of purpose so desperately needed as a basis for supporting global action.
These are all causes for doubt, for fear, for pessimism.
But in spite of these fears and doubts, you have continued your work and have continued to make steady progress in resolving many issues that once seemed intractable.
Thank you.
And even though the steps that you have taken and that have been taken by nations around the world sometimes seem small and even though the progress seems painfully slow, it is worth taking stock and recognizing that this great enterprise that began 16 years ago has now taken us to a vantage point from which we can see the basis for success because in spite of the remaining obstacles and difficulties, I believe that the causes for hope and optimism are greater than the causes for doubt and discouragement, and I believe the road to Copenhagen is now clear.
Developing countries that were once reluctant to join in the first phases of a global response to the climate crisis have themselves now become leaders in demanding action and in taking bold steps on their own initiative.
Just last week Brazil proposed an impressive new plan to halt the destructive deforestation in that nation.
Thanks to your efforts in Bali and in the continuing discussions, we now know how to integrate the protection of forests in a global agreement that also sharply reduces industrial sources of global warming pollution.
Yes, much more work needs to be done, but you have created the basis for integrating the different kinds of solutions that must come together to solve this crisis.
Another source of optimism, scientists and engineers and entrepreneurs in every part of the world have been busy and productive in developing exciting new ex-technologies that will dramatically improve our ability to create renewable energy, they are creating the basis for increasing living standards while simultaneously reducing pollution.
In my country there have also been promising and optimistic changes.
State governments, including the State of California, our largest state, have shown leadership by passing binding laws requiring the mandatory reduction of CO2.
884 U.S. cities have now embraced the principles of the Kyoto protocol without waiting for the Federal Government to act.
The United States -- dozens of proposed coal firing generating plants have in the last 2 years been cancelled because of grassroots opposition and public pressure to adopt renewable sources of energy.
The United States Supreme Court, which I must tell you in my opinion does not always reach the right conclusion, decided earlier this year in a ruling that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is required by law to regulate CO2 emissions.
No new coal fired generating plant can be approved without a decision by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
1 year ago this week in Bali at another extraordinary moment during this process, I asked you to anticipate the possibility that there would be significant changes in the approach of the U.S. national government to the climate crisis because of our oncoming elections.
Just prior to coming here to Poznan, I went to Chicago for a meeting with president-elect Barack Obama and he emphasized that the climate crisis will be a top priority of his administration.
We discussed how to create millions of new jobs in a new clean energy economy, and he emphasized that once he is president, the United States will once again engage vigorously in these negotiations and help lead toward a successful conclusion.
He said in another statement, “The science is beyond dispute.
The facts are clear….
Washington has failed to show leadership.
That will change when I take office.
My presidency will mark a new chapter in America's leadership on climate change… That will start with a Federal cap and trade system... It will not only help us bring about a clean energy future saving our planet, it will also help us transform our industries and steer our country out of this economic crisis….Solving this problem will require all of us working together….Once I take office, you can be sure that the United States will once again engage vigorously in these negotiations and help lead the world toward a new era of global cooperation on climate change.”
One of Mahatma Gandhi's -- one of those inspired by Mahatma Gandhi, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once said in discussing human rights, injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.
In that very same way, we now face a crisis that makes it abundantly clear that increased CO2 emissions anywhere are a threat to the integrity of this planet's climate balance everywhere.
As a result, the old divide between north and south, between developed countries and developing countries is a divide that must become obsolete.
We must link poverty reduction with the sharp reduction of CO2 emissions, including reduced emissions from deforestation with reform of the clean development mechanism and adequate funding for adaptation that is essential and must be financed even though obviously mitigation and prevention are the primary task because without them adaptation would ultimately prove to be impossible.
I was a fan of Gordon Brown on climate change.
Among other virtues, he was outspoken about the Denialists and he picked up the ball on climate finance and ran with it after Copenhagen.
He is leaving No.
10 today and David Cameron will soon be the new Prime Minister.
See this from the AP.
So what’s that mean for climate change and energy policy in the UK?
Thankfully, the British Conservative Party is a lot less conservative on these issues than other conservative parties in other countries, some of which I won’t name - like the Republican Party in the US.
(Oops, I did.
Sorry.)
Meanwhile, the Tories’ junior partner in government, the Liberal Democrats, are fully committed to a “smart decentralised grid” in a “zero-carbon Britain.” Their webpage on Energy and Climate Change is also unequivocal about nukes: “More nuclear power will soak up subsidy, centralise energy production and hinder development of Britain’s vast renewable resources.
Nuclear has a dirty legacy and increases global security risks.
We oppose construction of further nuclear power stations.” Hear, hear.
So, in Britain, you’ve got one of the Conservative’s leading politicians writing an op-ed in the “Financial Times” entitled A strong case for switching to green taxation .
George Osborne’s piece concludes thusly: “The case for a green tax switch is compelling, and I want to build a consensus across the political spectrum that it should be used alongside carbon trading schemes in the fight against climate change.” His party is four square for vigorous, progressive approaches to combating the climate change crisis.
For more, go to their website: Blueprint for a green economy .
Okay, now see this, Labour starts renewable energy drive to win back climate initiative , from the “Guardian.” It appears that “Labour is in danger of reverting to being seen as the least green of the three.” I’ve noted how Tony Blair and his administration have voiced concern for climate change and pushed to get things done, and I’ve also talked about Ken Livingstone, London’s mayor, and the extraordinary leadership role he’s assumed.
But the question now is will the British government and the Labor party continue to forge ahead on renewables, energy efficiency and curtailing GHG.
Even the third party, the Liberal Democrats, are pushing hard.
Their manifesto on climate change is hard hitting and even, dare I say it, a little radical.
They have an extensive white paper that calls for a ” Zero Carbon Britain .” They also are issuing a rallying cry to help lead the world on addressing global warming.
The government of Alberta, Canada said it is considering Total's proposal for a massive new oil sands mine.
The proposal includes establishment of another "tailings pond," a body of water the size of a small lake that stores toxic liquid leftovers of the mining process.
Total's proposal comes just days after a judge found Syncrude, the largest producer in the oil sands, guilty in the deaths of migratory waterfowl that were poisoned in one of its tailings ponds.
On June 25, Alberta Provincial Court Judge Ken Tjosvold issued a guilty verdict against oil sands producer Syncrude for the deaths of 1,600 ducks that landed on one of its 4.6-square-mile tailings lakes in August 2008.
The judge said the firm failed to ensure the safety of birds under the Alberta Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act and the Federal Migratory Birds Convention Act.
Environmental groups said the ruling highlights the danger to wildlife, land and water of a runaway oil sands boom — output could climb 40 percent in 10 years — and that Canada must do more to tame the tailings ponds.
According to Muxlow, chances are slim, however, that the verdict will bolster more enforcement of the oil sands.
The pattern in Alberta is to deny environmental impacts and "try to carry on with business as usual," she told SolveClimate.
Total's proposal will be heard before the Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB), an independent agency that regulates Alberta's energy resources, on September 21.
The Sierra Club had asked the firm to answer questions on the project's impact on water quality and greenhouse gas emissions, as well as Aboriginal treaty rights for the region.
Total has issued a refusal to respond through its lawyers, and ERCB is moving ahead.
The Sierra Club is now fighting to get intervener status in the hearing process and to hire experts to conduct independent environmental assessments.
Mining the sticky bitumen of the tarry sands releases three times more greenhouse gas pollution than conventional crude.
Industry argues that total lifecycle emissions are only about 15 percent greater because oil refined from the bitumen is of an inferior grade and releases fewer greenhouse gases when burned.
Production is now at about 1.3 million barrels per day.
The environmental impact of the mining goes beyond global warming pollution.
Each barrel of tar sands oil requires up to four barrels of water to extract.
A sludgy waste of chemicals, clay, sand and water gets deposited into massive contaminated tailing lakes,
Existing tailing ponds covered around 50 square miles in 2009.
The ponds are contaminated by phenols, arsenic, mercury and carcinogens.
Reports have surfaced in recent years that communities exposed to the toxic water have experienced higher than expected rates of cancer and other diseases.
The Keystone XL Pipeline would carry the crude 2,000 miles from Alberta to the Texas coast.
But the project is not cast in stone.
It came under fire last week after 50 members of Congress issued a letter against its approval, saying the line would do undue environmental harm.
The State Department's public comment period on its draft environmental impact statement of the pipeline just closed.
Old forests continue to accumulate carbon at a much greater rate than researchers had previously thought, making them more important as carbon sinks that must be factored into global climate models, researchers say.
Until recently, it was assumed that very old forests no longer absorbed carbon.
The only new growth occurred in the small spaces that opened up when large old trees died and decomposed, releasing their accumulated carbon.
The forests at large were therefore considered to be carbon neutral, and accounted as such in climate models.
Since the mid 1990s, more sophisticated data collection projects have measured carbon fluxes in forests around the world.
In particular, data has been shared between memebers of FLUXNET, a global network of observatory towers that measure the exchange of carbon dioxide, water vapour and energy between ecosystems and the atmosphere.
Now Sebastiaan Luyssaert of the University of Antwerp, Belgium, and his colleagues have taken advantage of all this new data to produce a meta-analysis of studies that monitored 519 plots of temperate and boreal forest between 15 and 800 years of age.
Their conclusion, published in Nature this week, is that old-growth forests are, in general, still absorbing carbon 1 .
Primary boreal and temperate forests, which make up 15% of global forests, sequester about 1.3 gigatonnes of carbon a year, give or take half a gigatonne.
That amounts to about 10% of the global net ecosystem productivity, which was previously accounted for elsewhere].
The conclusion makes sense, according to Susan Ustin, a plant ecologist at the University of California, Davis.
When determining the age of a tree, one counts its rings.
Each of those rings represents the transformation of atmospheric carbon into the living tissue of the tree.
In any one year, the death and decomposition of roots or branches may outweigh the carbon sequestered in the trunk - but over time, any significant growth must involve net carbon uptake.
"If they are carbon neutral at 400 years old, how are they going to make it to 1,000?
" she asks.
"If it was really carbon neutral, the trees would die.
"
The implications are many.
Scientists who were assuming that old-growth was carbon neutral may have consequently been overestimating sequestration in other ecosystems.
Climate models may have to be re-examined.
And policies that give credits to governments or companies for sequestering carbon may want to incorporate the protection of old-growth forests into their menu of options.
'"If they are carbon neutral at 400 years old, how are they going to make it to 1,000?
" she asks.
"If it was really carbon neutral, the trees would die.
"' This quote is misleading -- the ecological paradigm is not that individual trees cease to grow and become carbon-neutral over time, but rather that the ecosystem as a whole attains a balance between the death and decomposition of some individuals, and the establishment and growth of others.
There are several explanations as to why even very old forest ecosystems might be measured as carbon sinks.
One is that anthropogenic influences, such as rising CO2 and increased rates of nitrogen deposition, may be increasing the growth rate of ecosystems which were formerly close to carbon-neutrality.
Another is that the eddy covariance method is not capturing the egress of certain forms of organic carbon from the system.
Dissolved organic carbon could be leaching out of the bottom of the system, unmeasured, while CO2 comes in the top at an equal rate.
Or volatile organic carbon compounds could be escaping unmeasured out the top.
To confirm that mature forests are indeed carbon sinks, I agree that eddy covariance sites need more funding, to carry out soil and vegetation surveys and explicitly track the stocks of carbon over time.
I have the impression that things have been mixed up in the article and the following discussion.
While I agree with the authors of the article (as well as with several other recent papers which appeared in Nature and elsewhere) that boreal forests seem to be a much more important carbon sink than previously thought, it seems that at least partly the important part of the argumentation is missing.
Granted, the net ecosystem carbon balance depends on the balance between carbon assimilation by plants and its release through plant respiration and from decomposing dead organic matter.
However, some recent studies indicate that not all dead organic matter undergoes complete decomposition and mineralization, ending up in carbon dioxide evolved back to the atmosphere.
A number of studies, especially made in boreal forests, indicate on the possibility that part of the dead organic matter is transformed to what we call ?stabilized soil organic matter?
? the organic matter that is extremely resistant to decomposition and either does not decompose at all or is decomposed at the rate close to zero.
This can be seen from some long-term studies where it was shown that none of the traditional decomposition models assuming 100% decay (even if asymptotic) does not fit the data, and instead an asymptotic model with an asymptote at less than 100% decomposition describes the phenomenon much better.
This leads to the conclusion that boreal forests can be an important carbon sink even if they do not accumulate more carbon in tree biomass (as would be expected in ?climax?
ecosystems). This topic is discussed more in depth in our recent book ?Litter decomposition: a guide to carbon and nutrient turnover?
(Björn Berg and Ryszard Laskowski, Advances in Ecological Research 38).
Using existing data, Rockström and colleagues put ‘acceptable’ upper limits on seven environmental parameters: climate change, ocean acidification, stratospheric ozone depletion, freshwater use, biodiversity loss, the global cycles of nitrogen and phosphorus, and land-use change.
Crossing even one of these boundaries, they say, would risk triggering abrupt or irreversible environmental changes.
And if one boundary is transgressed, then others are at serious risk of being breached.
For some parameters, such as nitrogen loading and atmospheric CO2 concentrations, we may have already stepped out of our safety zone and need to back-pedal quickly.
For others, such as ocean acidification, we may still have enough time to avoid catastrophic change if we act wisely.
But do we understand the Earth system well enough to know the real limits to environmental degradation?
And if we can define them, even roughly, would doing so would ultimately help or hinder efforts to protect the planet?
We posed these questions to seven leading experts, who were invited to respond to the ‘planetary boundaries’ proposal.
Each author brings specific expertise to evaluating one aspect of the proposed framework.
Their responses can be freely accessed at Nature Reports Climate Change .
We’ve weighed in with our own thoughts in an editorial in Nature, and with a podcast.

For the most part, our respondents agree that the ‘planetary boundaries’ framework is a useful and worthwhile endeavour.
But they also issue words of caution in choosing upper limits on environmental degradation.
Some such as ocean chemist Peter Brewer question whether we know enough to choose the right parameters; on ocean acidification, for example, does an upper bound on aragonite saturation fully represent the potential detriment of loading the ocean with CO2?
Similarly, climatologist Myles Allen warns that setting a limit on long-term atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations may distract from the much more immediate challenge of limiting warming to 2°C.
Whatever the long-term target, keeping temperatures to no more than 2°C above pre-industrial values will require substantial emissions reductions over the coming decades, says Allen.
Without knowing what future generations might do, and without a good understanding of the long-term behaviour of the carbon cycle, perhaps we should focus on what’s achievable in the near-term?
Do you agree?
Is the planetary boundaries framework a useful way of measuring sustainability?
Join the discussion here on Climate Feedback.
I found this feature by Nature, the associated commentaries, and the original paper by the Stockholm Resilience Centre to be incredibly depressing reading.
Not because of the information they contain but for what they do not say.
The entire motivation for examining these limits is because the size of the human population and its associated resource consumption and production of waste products have now become so huge that they threaten our own survival.
Indeed, with our total ecological footprint now >1.25 planet Earths we are already in a state of population overshoot.
However, the topic of population growth is such a vexed and contentious issue that not even a supposed centre of objectivity such as Nature appears able to handle it openly (though full credit to commentators David Molden and Peter Brewer for at least mentioning it).
The scientific community seems to tie itself in knots trying to avoid talking about population issues.
The language at the Stockholm Resilience Centre website is typical.
Phrases such as “rapid expansion of human activities” and “the expanding human enterprise” do, of course, encapsulate the idea that environmental impact is a product of both population size and consumption.
However, with the world population expanding linearly by 79 million people per year (the growth rate is no longer decreasing, www.worldwatch.org/node/6257) and each person needing about 2000 kcal from food per day to survive there truly are limits to growth that we appear to be rapidly approaching (especially in light of concerns that we have probably passed the peak of world oil production last year, see www.energybulletin.net/50077).
In language better suited to a report by a management consultant the paper by Rockström et al.
states, “The proposed concept of ‘planetary boundaries’ lays the groundwork for shifting our approach to governance and management, away from the essentially sectoral analyses of limits to growth aimed at minimizing negative externalities, towards the estimation of the safe space for human development”.
This perpetuates the illusion that there is still uncertainty about the suicidal trajectory on which the human species is set and how close the edge of the cliff is.
If we cannot talk openly and clearly about population growth (i.e.
if we cannot, as a scientific community, recognise the scale and urgency of the problem) then there is no hope that the world can take the necessary action to avoid – or even ameliorate – the approaching ecological disaster (population crash).
This model makes a lot of major unfounded assumptions, perhaps the biggest being that humans are incapable of thriving under climate scenarios that differ greatly from the Holocene.
The concept of planetary boundaries is interesting and stimulating, but the management of the idea is poorly handled in the paper.
First of all, the idea lacks a falsification criterium, which is essential - according to science philosopher Popper - for any scientific theory.
The authors claim that climate change has already crossed the critical boundary (350 ppm), and they try to show some evidence for this.
However, much more interesting question would be what is the evidence that would falsify this theory?
For instance, should the Arctic sea ice develop only uni-directionally after crossing the boundary?
Or is its present behaviour, where a slight 'recovery' is observable since 2007 in the summer sea ice extent, actually falsifying the overall concept of ecosystem thresholds, tipping points and regime shifts?
The biggest problem of the whole climate science at the moment is that it lacks falsification criteria.
If reversals, improvements or recoveries happen in any atmospheric or ecosystem characteristics, they are explained only afterwards, posterior, as "fitting to the data or predictions".
It would fine to have a priori stated falsification criteria for any scientific theory.
What data or phenomenon would dispute the theory of planetary boundaries?
At ApocaDocs.com, we're trying to "humor the horror of environmental collapse," because so few people are willing to listen -- and fewer still willing to understand -- without a little humor thrown in.
It's also become a resource for background on particular crises -- stories going back a couple of years on the Plastic Gyres, on White Nose Syndrome, ocean acidification, and on and on.
It has been quite depressing to see the non-"global warming" emergencies getting such short shrift in the media; perhaps this majestic work can wake up even politicians to the fact that nature and humanity are all interrelated.
Spraying sparkly things into the skies to ward off warming won't fix ocean acidification, or phosphorus/nitrogen cycles, or species collapse... geoengineering is a fool's game, given our track record so far.
I agree that setting upper control limits on some of the proposed boundaries is or can be dangerous.
However if we understand that boundaries are not static but variable pending further research and measurement methodology then our opportunity is to start narrowing in on key environmental impact metrics which would not only provide upper control limits (UCL) but lower control limits (LCL).
Perhaps this research will eventually answer the key question "what is a normal earth biodiversity system".
Today we don't know since what one thinks is normal the other deems unacceptable.
Perhaps I am not interpreting the planetary boundary graphic correctly, but the size of the red wedge extending beyond the threshold does not seem to correlate with the degree of overshoot.
For example, the threshold for climate change is 350 ppm CO2, so the graphic would indicate the planet is currently at 525 ppm (50% higher than the threshold) if one uses the concentric circles as a guide, or more than 100% beyond the threshold if one compares the areas of the wedges.
I hope this work is better than the Limits to Growth.
This was comprehensively refuted on its first publication in the 1970s (when we were supposed to be running out of key materials, causing death by pollution etc by 2000).
See in particular papers by William Nordhuas in Brookings Papers on economic Activity, or the excellent book by Christopher Freeman and colleagues from the Science Policy Research Unit at Sussex.
this has not stopped the authors from essentially repeating the same flawed approach in several new editions.
But there was no reason to believe them in the early 1970s and there is no reason to believe them now.
I didn’t see any mention of preventing coal from being burned (to replace declining oil and natural gas) as a key part of limiting climate change – are the maximum amounts of coal that can be burned per year known?
Clean coal is not going to happen (2).

Chemical pollution and aerosol loading overlap.
3.
Change in land use and climate are related in terms of the carbon cycle.
4.
Biodiversity loss is related to land use and climate.
5.
Availability of freshwater is related to climate and land use.
I largely agree with Christian Samper's comments.
I would add that, for maintaining ecosystem functions (and services), the important thresholds for biodiversity loss should be measured in terms of the local abundance of particular species, not the overall global extinction rate.
This was a deliberate choice, justified by the core rationale behind the planetary boundaries concept.
What we propose with the concept is that we need to define the Earth system processes that determine the ability of the Planet to remian in a desired "Holocene" state (the conducive state we assume is a pre-condition to suppport a growing population).
This definition can thus be done irrespective of our human impacts on the planet, i.e., they - the planetary boundary processes - define the regulatory capacity of the Planet to remain in a stable state, irrespective of how many we are.
Once this is done (and we tentatively propose a set of quantifications for 7 of the 9 boundaries we have been able to identify), humanity should be able (is our assumption) to thrive within the safe operating space that the boundary levels provide.
To succeed, population growth (and the level of social and economic development associated with it)must then occur within the safe space to be sustainable.
Population growth - as ample evidence clearly shows - within the current (largely) unsustainable growth paradigm, generates major negative environmental impacts, and is thus a key driver of change challenging the planetary boundaries - but it is not a boundary in itself.
The planetary boundaries concept thus provides us only with a definition of global sustainability based on growing insights of the risks of non-linear change at the Earth system or major sub-system scale.
It does not provide a paradigm of how to achieve sustainable development, which includes population growth and human welfare as key ingredients.
a slight 'recovery' is observable since 2007 in the summer sea ice extent
The boundary that concerns me is ocean acidification, so my questions are for Peter Brewer.
First, how well do we understand the factors influencing local saturation limits for carbonic acid in ocean water?
In addition to the well-understood effects of temperature, the movement of the water (waves, tides, hurricanes) could affect it like the shaking of a carbonated drink.
Also, what else is dissolved in the same water will influence the limits of carbonic acid uptake.
I suspect that these factors are poorly quantified by reseach to date.
Second, do we know the limits of tolerance for acidified environs on algae?
Oceanic algae are known to be the main photosynthetic source of carbon dioxide uptake on Earth, with marine diatoms in polar waters and dinoflagellates in tropical waters being the largest contributors.
Third, if human-generated carbon dioxide has contributed most of the current level of carbonic acid in the oceans, that may indicate that a large portion of carbon dioxide generated since the Industrial Revolution (at least - perhaps even earlier) has not been taken up through photosynthesis as previously supposed.
If this is taken into account, and the carbonic acid saturation levels for the world ocean are exceeded, how fast will atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide rise?
In setting the stage for the interesting feature “A safe operating space for humanity” (Nature, 461, 472-5; 2009) Rockström et al repeatedly state that the climate of the Holocene has been stable.
They further imply, by contrasting this purported past stability with the many large anthropogenic changes impacting the Earth system today that climatic stability has been of key importance to allowing human civilizations to develop and flourish.
This paradigm can be criticized in two important ways.
First, the Holocene was not climatically stable, and second there are good reasons to believe that it is precisely the dramatic and dynamic history of Holocene climatic variability that ‘saw human civilizations arise develop and thrive’ and ‘enabled human development’.
Although it is true that global atmospheric temperatures did not change much during the Holocene, we know, from well-dated quantitative paleorecords, that regional hydrological change during this period has been extremely large.
The extent of glaciation in the European Alps, for example, has been highly variable during this time, including periods when the glaciers were substantially more restricted than today.
Lake levels in much of semiarid Africa have risen and fallen by order 100 meters on similar timescales.
Large, and often rapid, regional climatic changes, often involving hydrological balance, have occurred throughout the Holocene, and have had substantial impacts on human societies, including playing a role in the demise of several civilizations (eg.
Mayan, Akkadian, Greenland Norse).
Furthermore, it seems quite plausible that human societies, developed, adapted and grew strong precisely in response to such variability, not because they were ensconced in a cocoon of stability.
Although there is no doubt that we live in both unusual and challenging times, human induced changes to the Earth system are not happening against a backdrop of 10,000 years of Holocene climatic stability, and it is precisely our ability to make societal changes and adapt to variability that is now required in the face of the dire global anthropogenic changes that Rockström et al.

It seems to me that migration is the best -sometimes only- adaptation strategy when the climate becomes hostile.
But this strategy is quite an ordeal when much of the society's wealth is invested in real state and with the modern political divisions and restrictions on migration.
Although, IMHO, catastrophes have probably played a role in decay more frequently than in development, it's certainly true that, when overcomed, difficulties such as hunger, wars or climate changes, and their challenges are a boost to development.
However, the society thrives by facing (i.e.
avoiding) those hardships, and the sooner the problem is anticipated and faced, the more the chances of success.
My primary concern is in reference to the section on biodiversity loss.
The article refers to species extinctions and biodiversity loss.
It is important to distinguish the two.
Species extinction is an important factor, but as Paul Ehlrich et al.
have noted: population level extinction is occurring at ~20X the rate of species extinction.
The sum is greater than the parts.
Population levels of biodiversity are the more sensitive indicator of natural capital.
Conservation biologists have been reporting on this for a number of years and are asking other scientists to stop pointing at species loss alone.
We need to understand and measure the net loss to biodiversity as a process and across all levels of measurement.
Species loss is bean counting, whereas populations are the more important indicator in this context.
Measurements based on species extinctions alone grossly underestimate the extent of damage that has been done - if it isn't already depressing enough.
Atte Korhola>> When it comes to the dangers of anthropogenic global warming, I believe a falsification would be:
To find a historic period, when CO2 levels have risen with at least ~35% during a fairly short period, and no discernable reaction in other forcings have occured, such as increased H2O gas, increased CH4, decreasing ice masses and rapidly rising temperatures (more than 0.4-0.7 C/50-100 years).
You miss my point.
My question was: what would be an unusual development regarding Arctic sea ice extent that would falsify your theory?
Can you state it a priori?
Many researchers cannot find any evidence for a critical threshold (or "tipping point") beyond which the
ice cover melts away in an irreversible process (see e.g.
Eisenman & Wettleaufer, PNAS 106:28-32, 2009).
What sort of sea behaviour would be inconsistent with your theory of planetary boundaries?
This very same question could be asked also regarding other examples that you present for boundary crossings.
Thanks for your clarification.
I don't know what a falsification evidence would be like, I just meant to answer your question "is its present behaviour, where a slight 'recovery' is observable since 2007 in the summer sea ice extent, actually falsifying the overall concept of ecosystem thresholds, tipping points and regime shifts?
", in the sense of "I don't think so, because this behaviour falls within the expected behaviour as described by the theory".
In my view, the concepts of threshold and tipping points arise from the fact that constant exponential consumption growth cannot hold indefinitely within a finite system such as Earth's natural resources.
There might be disagreement on where those threshold are, but IMHO not on the existence of such limits.
And "scientists" are there to sell theirs souls giving background to keep the insanity going on at costs of human healthy insecurity, food insecurity, contamination of earth sistems and extintions of species both natural and cultural ones.
This is a very important contribution to the goal of connecting basic climate change science with climate change policy.
The authors have been very careful to explain that the numbers proposed here are a rough draft.
But it's a start that should lead to focused research in addressing the question: what are the boundaries within which humanity can proceed in a way that is acceptable and tolerable.
No thoughtful person could think that the future of humanity is in danger.
Doubtless humans will be able to survive under any climate change scenario.
The key question is, however, what future do we find acceptable, and what physical boundaries would allow that?
This is a challenging set of questions but one that can be addressed by science.
This contribution provides a start.
My major concerns about such useful beginnings are that concepts developed from understanding of processes and characteristics at lower levels of biological organization sometimes get applied uncritically at higher levels of organization and integration.
In particular, I am troubled when I read about uncritical applications of concepts from the genetics, individual organism or population levels applied to ecosystems - especially forest ecosystems - that have been the focus of my studies.
I believe that an organismal interpretation of ecosystems is not supported by our current understanding of the ecosystems with which I am familiar.
Similarly, I am unable to accept an organismal interpretation of the earth, such as in the Gaia theory.
While there is little doubt and much empirical evidence that the terrestrial biota plays an important role in hydrology, climate, biogeochemistry and soil development, amongst other things, I cannot accept that this is purposive, but rather the result of genetically-controlled tolerances and adaptations to the physical environment, that becomes altered to a degree by their functional processes.
A particular concern is the frequently vague treatment of ecosystem "resilience".
Users of this term should define their use of it at the outset, and address the issues of the ecologcal role of natural disturbance at the species, community and ecosystem levels, and then contrast this with the ecological consequences of human effects on both global and local ecosystems.
I find that much of the discussion of biodiversity and its relationship to various interpretations of "resilience" lacking in detail - what measures of biodiversity over what spatial scales, and over what time scales?
And there is a persistent confusion between biodiversity and ecological diversity.
In the metaphor of "ecological theatre", ecological diversity (climate, topography, soils, hydrology, and physical disturbances such as fie and wind) consitutues the "ecological stage" which determines which of several alternative "ecological plays" can be acted out on that "stage".
The "ecological play" is the sequence of biotic communities that successively occupy and are replace by other communities over time as a result of proceses of ecological succession, new "plays" being initiated by disturbance that causes successional retrogresion (or sometimes accelleration).
The "actors" (species)involved in the "play" are one measure of biodiversity.
Consideration of boundaries at the global level is very necessary, but just as the Limits to Growth analysis was weak (despite which I support the overall conclusion of limits and the problem of linkages between issues)because it lacked adequate bottom-up linkages,the present useful exercise must ensure that our knowlegde of genetic diversity, species and community diversity, the diversity of "ecological stages" (from the ecological theatre metaphor), as well as our current understanding of ecological processes are fed upwards to the global assessment.
The current popularity amongst some of simple "bioclimatic" models to predict plant species shifts in resonse to climate change is an example of an unfortunate level of simplification.
We appreciate the several comments that we have received on the climate change boundary.
These have helped us to sharpen the line of argument for the boundary as well as reiterate some important features of the planetary boundaries concept.
1.
Regarding the proposed boundary itself (350 ppm atmospheric CO2 concentration and 1 W m-w radiative forcing relative to pre-industrial), we emphasise the uncertainly zone of 350 to 550 ppm, and our use of the precautionary principle to place the proposed boundary at the lower end of the uncertainty zone.
The current global discussion of CO2 targets, much of it centred around 450 – 500 ppm CO2, as a target concentration is thus entirely consistent with our planetary boundary approach.
The key issue is risk: how much risk is society willing to take with the potential impacts of climate change.
Thus, setting a boundary for climate change is a highly normative process, informed, we hope, by the type of arguments we have made in suggesting a climate change boundary.
Our approach is entirely consistent with the aggregate emissions approach, which has been recently advocated as a policy option for managing emissions trajectories.
We should add, however, that the translation of aggregate emissions into an atmospheric CO2 concentration depends also on the behaviour of carbon sinks on the land and in the ocean, and the relationship between the rate of emissions and the behaviour of the sinks.
(i) Climate sensitivity, which in our view should also include the “slow feedbacks” in the climate system – primarily albedo changes associated with changes in the large polar ice sheets and in the distribution of vegetation – which are not currently included in GCM simulations.
Inclusion of these feedbacks roughly doubles the climate sensitivity, from about 3 deg C to about 6 deg C, for a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration above pre-industrial.
The timescale associated with these slow feedbacks - several centuries to a millennium – is within the ethical timeframe we consider in our planetary boundary analysis.
(ii) Destabilisation of the large polar ice sheets, which would lead to significant increases in sea-level in addition to contributing to the slow feedbacks described above.
At our current atmospheric CO2 concentration of about 387 ppm, we are committed to an equilibrium global temperature rise of about 1.3 deg C above pre-industrial, which, according to palaeo-climate evidence, will lead to a sea-level rise of several metres over the next centuries.
Both the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets have shown net mass loss at an increasing rate over the past decade.
(iii) At the current CO2 concentration of about 387 ppm, serious impacts that can reasonably be linked to anthropogenic climate change, are already occurring in many parts of the world.
These include the rapid melting of glaciers in the Hindu Kush-Himalaya region with implications for water resources over much of Asia; the 2003 heatwave in central Europe with thousands of excess deaths, increased bleaching of coral reefs around the world; crippling drought and violent bushfires in southeast Australia; and increased inundation events on many low lying islands in the Indian and Pacific oceans.
3.
The fact that our two boundaries – one based on atmospheric CO2 concentration (350 ppm) and the other based on radiative forcing (+1 W m-2 compared to pre-industrial) – are not precisely equivalent has triggered several comments.
The slight mismatch in quantitative values is deliberate; otherwise we would have had a single boundary.
The radiative forcing boundary, which is the slightly more stringent boundary, is also the more fundamental from a scientific perspective and includes all of the ways in which human activities modify the climate.
We included the CO2-based boundary because it is the most important of the anthropogenic greenhouse gases and is central to the current policy debates.
Planetary boundaries need to be both relevant to policy and grounded in the best science.
Given the complexity and urgency of the climate change debate, we believe that a double-barrelled boundary is the most effective.
4.
The debate about our proposed climate change boundary – and indeed about the appropriateness of the control variables we have selected – is just what we hoped would happen.
The planetary boundaries article is basically a proof-of-concept paper that represents the beginning of both a scientific and social discussion, and not the final word, on our relationship with the Earth.
We are pleased that the article has added momentum to this important discussion, and we appreciate the challenging but constructive nature of the comments.
Thanks for your comments, Will Steffen and Johan Rockström.
Your answer regarding climate change boundary is fair enough to me (in fact, my comment was preliminar, just at first glance; later on, I read the whole article with more detail and I saw that the risk-aversion argument was explicitly stated in your paper).
Within the current scientific range you've taken a lower limit.
That's fine.
I think that the slow feedback estimation is a bit speculative, but, as you said, that goes into the politics of risk aversion, and I wouldn't like to distract the attention from the real issue: that we are already moving just around the dangerous boundary.
By the way, we, MATRIX (Mathematical Arts and Transdisciplinary Research Initiatives for Climate Systems, Ehime University, Japan), have developed a novel Earth-System model for persistent organic pollutants (POPs).
The model could well be applicable to any toxic pollutants which include those in the Stockholm Convention on POPs.
We would like to contribute to better defining the planetary boundary for Chemical Pollution.
Amidst talk of environmental/ecological/social/economic chaos related to climate change, it is shameful and puzzling to not see emphasis on how overpopulation cancels all efforts at reducing the spiraling effects of global climate change.
As noted by Alan Weisman (The World Without Us, 2007), Bill McKibben (Maybe One: A case for smaller families, 1999; The End of Nature, 2006), Storms of My Grandchildren, 2009 by James Hansen, and other publications, all efforts to reduce our carbon footprints (i.e., stomping the life from our only Earth) will have no real lasting effect unless population growth is reversed.

As anticipated , deforestation has emerged as something of a thorny issue at the UN conference on climate change, currently nearing a close in Bali.
It was announced yesterday that measures to avoid further destruction of tropical forests, such as the Amazon, will be included in the agreement to come out of the talks at the end of this week.
The Bali agreement is expected to act as a guideline for negotiations on an international climate change deal up until the end of 2009.
Daniel Nepstad of Woods Hole Research Centre, US said today in Bali that the Amazon rainforest is expected to see a 55% dieback by 2030 through deforestation, logging and drought.
Rainforests in other nations, such as Indonesia are facing similar pressures.
So, any effort to avoid deforestation, which accounts for an estimated 20-25% of global greenhouse gas emissions, is to be commended.
But the solution being put forward to in Bali , known as REDD - Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation, is being met with opposition on many sides.
Under the proposed scheme for ‘avoided deforestation’, carbon sequestered by forests in developing countries that are not being cut can be traded on the carbon market, where developed countries can buy the credits and ‘offset’ them against their own emissions targets.
A draft text on deforestation is ready to go forward for discussion by the high level ministers, who arrived at the Bali conference today, said executive secretary of the UN conference on climate change, Yvo De Boer.
Countries such as Indonesia and numerous conservation NGOs are celebrating inclusion of the scheme.
And given that emissions from deforestation were omitted from the Kyoto Protocol, it is the first such international effort of its kind.
But much remains to be agreed upon.
The issue of whether such a scheme should include forest conservation is a remaining “bone of contention”.
As reported in the Hindustan Times, the Indian delegation wanted to add 'conservation' to 'avoided deforestation' , owing to the fact that India is one of the few developing countries where the forest cover is going up, not down.
“We should not be penalised for that” said secretary of the ministry of environment and forests, Meena Gupta
Today, Brazil's environment minister Marina Silva told the press in Bali that Brazil is entirely opposed to the concept of awarding credits to rich nations for avoided deforestation in developing countries, on the basis that it could lead to further emissions from developed nations that could simply pay to pollute.
“Brazil does not agree with credits for deforestation because we want 100% additionally.
Otherwise we do 100% of our homework and only get part of the credit”, said Silva.
On a high note, however, Norway has been commended by showing leadership on deforestation, following an announcement from Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg on Sunday that it will spend three billion kroner a year to help prevent deforestation in developing countries.
We’ll be covering more on deforestation on our upcoming podcast from Bali, so listen in for further discussion…

The Earth’s large forests take up substantially more atmospheric carbon dioxide through photosynthesis than they release back to the atmosphere through respiration.
Thus acting as a carbon ‘sink’, they (and the oceans) are our closest natural allies in the fight against climate change.
But many forests are at threat - not only from logging and clearing, but from climate change itself.
Take drought.
How will mature tropical rain forests respond to dryer conditions, which some climate models suggest might be ahead in the not-so-distant future?
The 2005 drought in the Amazon basin gave scientists an opportunity to find out.
What they saw is not particularly heartening: Prolonged dryness has apparently turned some affected areas of the Amazon from a carbon sink to a carbon source, a team led by Oliver Phillips of Leeds University in Britain reports in Science today (Abstract here ).
Patches subjected to a 100-milimetre decrease in rainfall released on average 5.3 tonnes of carbon per hectare – around 9 times the amount undisturbed tropical forests take up, on average, per year.
Basin-wide, between 1.2-1.6 billion tonnes of carbon were released during the 2005 drought, the team estimates.
Don't know anything about tropical rainforest but here in Victoria Australia out temprate rainforests have suffered sever drought for a decade and large chunks are bursting into flame.
/ ok I exagerated somewhat to make a point but that point has also been made by the CSIRO.

The 2009 State of the Climate report released today draws on data for 10 key climate indicators that all point to the same finding: the scientific evidence that our world is warming is unmistakable.
More than 300 scientists from 160 research groups in 48 countries contributed to the report, which confirms that the past decade was the warmest on record and that the Earth has been growing warmer over the last 50 years.
Based on comprehensive data from multiple sources, the report defines 10 measurable planet-wide features used to gauge global temperature changes.
The relative movement of each of these indicators proves consistent with a warming world.
Seven indicators are rising: air temperature over land, sea-surface temperature, air temperature over oceans, sea level, ocean heat, humidity and tropospheric temperature in the “active-weather” layer of the atmosphere closest to the Earth’s surface.
Three indicators are declining: Arctic sea ice, glaciers and spring snow cover in the Northern hemisphere.
“For the first time, and in a single compelling comparison, the analysis brings together multiple observational records from the top of the atmosphere to the depths of the ocean,” said Jane Lubchenco, Ph.D., under secretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere and NOAA administrator.
“The records come from many institutions worldwide.
They use data collected from diverse sources, including satellites, weather balloons, weather stations, ships, buoys and field surveys.
These independently produced lines of evidence all point to the same conclusion: our planet is warming,”
The report emphasizes that human society has developed for thousands of years under one climatic state, and now a new set of climatic conditions are taking shape.
These conditions are consistently warmer, and some areas are likely to see more extreme events like severe drought, torrential rain and violent storms.
“Despite the variability caused by short-term changes, the analysis conducted for this report illustrates why we are so confident the world is warming,” said Peter Stott, Ph.D., contributor to the report and head of Climate Monitoring and Attribution of the United Kingdom Met Office Hadley Centre.
“When we look at air temperature and other indicators of climate, we see highs and lows in the data from year to year because of natural variability.
Understanding climate change requires looking at the longer-term record.
When we follow decade-to-decade trends using multiple data sets and independent analyses from around the world, we see clear and unmistakable signs of a warming world.”
While year-to-year changes in temperature often reflect natural climatic variations such as El Niño/La Niña events, changes in average temperature from decade-to-decade reveal long-term trends such as global warming.
Each of the last three decades has been much warmer than the decade before.
At the time, the 1980s was the hottest decade on record.
In the 1990s, every year was warmer than the average of the previous decade.
The 2000s were warmer still.
“The temperature increase of one degree Fahrenheit over the past 50 years may seem small, but it has already altered our planet,” said Deke Arndt, co-editor of the report and chief of the Climate Monitoring Branch of NOAA’s National Climatic Data Center.
“Glaciers and sea ice are melting, heavy rainfall is intensifying and heat waves are more common.
And, as the new report tells us, there is now evidence that over 90 percent of warming over the past 50 years has gone into our ocean.”
More and more, Americans are witnessing the impacts of climate change in their own backyards, including sea-level rise, longer growing seasons, changes in river flows, increases in heavy downpours, earlier snowmelt and extended ice-free seasons in our waters.
People are searching for relevant and timely information about these changes to inform decision-making about virtually all aspects of their lives.

Although climate is chiefly a matter of winds, ocean currents, sunshine, rains, and snow, it involves also the responses of plants and animals to these physical factors.
Despite our alleged intelligence as a species, and despite the efforts of several little-heeded men, it has taken a long time for scientists to learn the facts of life as they pertain to the chain reaction of climate, physiological function, organic adaptation, and certain aspects of race, in animal in general, man included.
The most cursory knowledge of such traits as the use of fire, clothing, shelter, and diet makes it clear that climate is an implicit function of the process we call culture.
Until recently few meteorologists believed that we were living in a period of climate changes that could be substantiated by meteorological data.
The changes deduced from such data were often dismissed as random, and it was thought that over longer period of records they would average out.
Cutting greenhouse gases and switching to sustainable development are unlikely to prevent disasters caused by climate change, one of the world's most respected environmentalists warns today.
Professor James Lovelock, the leading independent environmental scientist, claims that even the most pessimistic outcomes predicted by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) fail to recognise the speed with which global warming will progress.
In a speech at the Royal Society, Prof Lovelock will describe how he has arrived at an "apocalyptic view" of the future, in which 6 to 8 billion people face diminishing food and water supplies in an increasingly intolerable climate.
Earlier this year, the IPCC published its final report on the likely extent of global warming.
It concluded that average global temperatures could rise by as much as 6.4C by the end of the century if carbon emissions continue to increase.
A rise of 4C was most likely, the panel said.
The rising temperatures could force hundreds of species to become extinct and trigger conflicts in countries struck by droughts and severe flooding.
But Prof Lovelock will tell the society that while the IPCC report is written in "properly cautious scientific language", it "gives the impression that global heating is serious but the worst consequences are avoidable if we take appropriate action now.
Sadly, even the most pessimistic of the climate prophets of the IPCC panel do not appear to have noticed how rapidly the climate is changing.
"
He believes computer models used by IPCC scientists underestimate the magnitude of climate change by failing to consider the world as an entity in which living organisms inextricably feed into the environment, for example by releasing or absorbing greenhouse gases.
Instead, scientists treat deforestation, changes in marine populations and ocean acidification separately from other aspects of climate change such as melting ice sheets.
Prof Lovelock will refer to a study he published in Nature in 1994 with Lee Kump, a professor of geoscience at Penn State University, which attempted to model a "live Earth", where ocean and land organisms have a strong bearing on climate.
The study revealed that if atmospheric carbon dioxide levels reached 500ppm (parts per million), global temperatures would rise rapidly by 6C.
The IPCC calculations suggest around a 2C rise for the same CO2 levels.
The atmospheric level of CO2 stands at 380ppm but is rising by 2ppm a year.
Prof Lovelock is similarly gloomy over cuts in carbon dioxide emissions, claiming that positive feedbacks, which exacerbate warming, suggest that "implementing Kyoto or some super-Kyoto is most unlikely to succeed," referring to the international carbon reduction agreement that expires in 2012.
He will call for research aimed at reducing climate change by protecting ecosystems or altering them in ways that help them reflect solar radiation or absorb carbon dioxide.
New report warns loss of habitat caused by intensive farming, climate change, forest fires and tourism is threatening Europe's dragonflies, beetles and butterflies
After lo these many years, they popped into my head today as I read that Senate Democrats had finally thrown in the towel on an energy bill that would have included a partial cap-and-trade provision for limiting carbon emissions from power plants.
The bill, written by Senators John Kerry and Joe Lieberman, was touted by Washington insiders and some major environmental groups as this year’s last hope for federal climate legislation.
Yet it would have relied on carbon offsets and other dodges to postpone the day of reckoning with true, visible carbon emissions pricing — the cornerstone of meaningful climate policy.
Instead, reported the New York Times, Senate Democrats will pursue a limited bill aimed at increasing oversight of oil drilling and tightening energy efficiency standards — with no direct assault on climate-destabilizing CO2.
(For a later Times story amplifying the first, click here .
)
Yes, now, we may begin — “we” being Americans who care about climate, sustainability, and Earth — to unite around a climate approach that is effective, equitable and transparent enough to win the support of our fellow citizens and a Congressional majority.
The Senate’s antipathy to even the partial cap-and-trade proposed by Sen. Kerry will doubtless be spun as indicating that for the foreseeable future the well for climate legislation has been poisoned.
The Carbon Tax Center says that the opposite may be true: with cap-and-trade out of the way at last, the political well can begin to be de-toxified so that the effective, equitable and transparent carbon fee-and-dividend can be seriously considered.
For this to happen, however, the Big Green groups like EDF and NRDC that for years have dominated climate discourse among environmentalists, and that convinced Congressional Democrats and the White House that the only way to “put a price on carbon” in America was via carbon cap-and-trade, will have to abandon that approach and allow others, and themselves, to try a fresh start.
It will be said that cap-and-trade failed because Fox News and other climate deniers branded it as “cap-and-tax” and, therefore, a carbon tax (or fee) cannot possibly succeed.
And it is true that carbon cap-and-trade was looked to, years ago, as a way to build on the success of acid rain cap-and-trade, win over Republican free-marketers, and put a price on carbon without having to parade the dreaded t-a-x word before the public.
Instead, Big Green’s pursuit of carbon cap-and-trade tethered the climate movement to complex financial instruments and branded us as servants of Wall Street elites.
It opened the legislative floodgates to off-the-charts Beltway deal-making that rightly repulsed the public.
Perhaps most importantly, the co-optation of climate advocacy by the cap-and-traders robbed us of the high moral ground we might have shared with abolitionists, suffragists, labor agitators and civil rights workers — true American heroes who fought to liberate our society of oppression and injustice.
If you’re in the climate movement, you recognize that fossil fuels’ assault on Earth’s climate is an ultimate form of oppression and injustice: of rich against poor, of the profligate against the frugal, of the present against the future.
Ending this assault will require concerted action on many fronts; and it starts by internalizing the climate-damage costs of coal, oil and gas into their prices, so that the free ride for fossil fuels is ended and all of the alternatives, from energy efficiency, renewable energy and low-carbon fuels to conservation-based behavior and mindfulness toward energy consumption, may compete fairly and effectively .
[...] Fails to Move Climate/Energy Bill; From the Ashes, a Carbon Tax?
(NYT, Carbon Tax [...]
I believe you misread the politics.
Democrats won’t hang together on any climate bill and the only snowflake’s chance is if the mid-term elections bring in climate friendlier Senators.
For this to happen, you’ll have to show me why carbon tax would improve that snowflake’s chances.
I don’t see it.
If advisors Emanuel and Axelrod have Obama’s ear that the political payoff on climate change isn’t equal to that on health care, financial tweaking or extending unemployment insurance, they’ve won.
This is not a debate about the best is the enemy of the good.
Instead, let’s keep up organizing locally and regionally.
Show the world (well, US climate action opponents or the indifferent) that there is a better way.
And to paraphrase what subjects of days long gone (Thank God!
) would say, “The Climate Bill is dead!
Long live the Climate Bill!”
Now, how do we go about getting the new Climate Bill enthroned?
Many really dedicated climate activists, as opposed to Big Green, have turned to the cap and dividend bill, the Cantwell/Collins CLEAR Act as the best thing we can hope to achieve.
It’s clear (pun intended) to me that won’t get any further, either.
I hope great people like Ted Glick and Van Jones will get behind the carbon fee and dividend proposal.
I also meant to add that I so respect Janes Hansen who is so straight-on about anything pertaining to climate!
Albert’s comment suggests to me that this should become a climate dividend rather than a carbon tax.
Please consider that our collective foot is on the accelerator of climate change through billions of dollars of direct fuel subsidies, tens of billions of indirect (tax expensing) fuel subsidies, and hundreds of billions per year of externalized subsidies that exist due to the policy of “cheap fuels.”
I am in favor of your concerns, but should we continue to drive the climate toward meltdown via.
subsidy policy.
If not, then let’s start identifying these, such as the work of Green Scissors 2010 report and Sima Gandhi of Center for American Progress.
I had a good time the other night talking about climate change policy and politics with Amanda Little on The Hyperbole Hour .
We’re on the same wavelength.
(You can download the show as an mp3 file and listen in from around 29 minutes.
)
One of the points we made was that we really need to sell the case in the US for why cap-and-trade and clean tech are the only way to fly.
In response to an FT analysis on Copenhagen I noted the other day, there was a good letter that reinforces this point from two worthies at the UK’s Institute for Public Policy Research .
They say “…the politics of climate change are tough.” (That’s an understatement.
) They go on to note “This calls for an urgent reframing of the issue in terms that matter to people now: less dependence on oil, investment in renewable energy, renewed economic growth as a result of innovation, jobs, and security.” That’s all true.
Beyond that, there are the costs involved in ignoring the issue.
How is it possible for the elected representatives of people in the Gulf Coast and Texas, in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Ike, or for that matter, representatives from farm states, who are going to be crushed by warming, to vote against Waxman-Markey ?
It’s possible because we’re not yet making the case convincing enough, particularly in the face of dogmatic opposition by some as well as subterfuge from special interests.
Hello Bill!
You may be unaware but the weather in the Midwest has been similar to that of the 1800s for the last two years and harvests are down significantly because of the cold.
We’ve had snow on the ground for 2 months and people aren’t thinking about the consequences of global warming.
Job approval for those listed in your article is on the decline, and political capital, unlike paper money, is a finite commodity which few politicians will use on cap and trade in order to be reelected.
Campaigning has begun for the November elections and climate change, by most polling, has become one of the lowest priorities for voters in this struggling economy.
Thanks for this, Kid.
You are certainly preaching to the choir here when you assert that the politics of climate change legislation are difficult and dirty.
I’ve written about that many times here.
But what I’ve also been saying is that there are misperceptions by the bushel, owing to concerted efforts by some ideologues and special interests to sow confusion.
It is the role of folks like me to try to undo some of those misperceptions.
As to Jim Hansen , I have nothing but total respect for him as a climate scientist.
Let’s just say our opinions diverge on policy.
On impacts on the nation’s breadbasket, see this , for instance, from the National Academies.
I also referenced a report here on why farmers should be terrified of the looming impacts and not be at all concerned about costs in mitigation and adaptation.
The view on impacts is underscored by this comprehensive study by the US Dept.
of Agriculture.
“The report focuses on the next 25 to 50 years, and finds that climate change is already affecting U.S. water resources, agriculture, land resources, and biodiversity, and will continue to do so.” As to the costs to farmers from Waxman-Markey, Ag.
also looked at that here .
“In fact, the impact on net farm income is less than a 1% decrease.
In the short run, agricultural offset markets may cover these costs.
Over the medium-term and long-term, costs to agriculture rise but remain modest (3.5% and 7.2% decreases in net farm income, respectively).
However, benefits to agriculture from an offsets market rise over time and will likely overtake costs in the medium and long term.”
Many U.S. and International academic climatologist now agree, in whole or in part, that the sun causes a considerable amount, if not all, of the earth’s surface temperature variability and that C02 fluctuations follow this variability – not the reverse.
The science behind this is reviewed briefly on the next two pages and is convincing.
Most independent atmospheric scientists are on board.
Government and U.N. supported departments are recalcitrant due to secure grant support and to avoid career embarrassment.
The debate has become idealogical – similar to Darwinism in the late 19th century.
The larger science community has been slower.
Most have a vague understanding of black body radiation but evidence for C02 lagging temperature variability has only recently come to light.
Also, the retrograde solubility of C02 has not yet been widely publicized.
The public lags way behind as do many purveyors of the news—undoubtedly because C02 has been publicized in the same breath as “pollution”, “climate change”, and “global warming”.
This makes for an easy villain in a simple story.
This is clearly wrong!
On the other hand there are hundreds of reputable atmospheric scientists who know that solar cycles control most, if not all, of earth’s temperature variation.
These include the late Dr. Frederick Seitz, Nat.
Academy of Sciences; Dr. John Christie, Univ.
of Alabama; Dr. Roger Pielke, Univ.
of Colorado; Dr. Fred Singer, Univ.
of Virginia; Dr. Patrick Michaels, George Mason Univ; Dr. Richard Lindzen, MIT; Dr. Ian Pilner, Univ.
of Adelaide; Dr. Howard Hayden, Univ.
of Connecticut; Lord Christopher Monckton, Scotland; Dr. Zbigniew Jaworowski, Poland; Dr. Bob Carter, Australia; Dr. Dick Thoenes, Eindhoven Univ; –and hundreds of others.
In addition many organizations have been set up to relay truthful science to policymakers and the public including the Science and Public Policy Institute, The Center for Science and Public Policy, Friends of Science, and the Science and Environmental Policy Project.
This latter group sepp.org ) and its sister organization- The Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change—published it’s 2008 report: “Nature, Not Human Activity, Rules the Climate” nipccreport.org ).
It’s contributors are international unsponsored luminaries in the field and are only interested in disseminating true facts concerning climate variability and its causes.
At this point true climate science needs to overcome more than unwieldy ice cores and conflicting surface temperature data sets.
They are fighting well funded zealots and governments whose motives are idealogy rather than science.
They are fighting a political machine including govt.
sponsored websites, K-12 education programs, movies, books, and agency funded elaborate productions on the NGO channel.
Prof. Howard Hayden has remarked about this “global warming pseudoscience”—-“What other basic scientific truth has ever needed $300 million to promote itself?” We even have a cabinet level Secretary of Climate Change!
Beside faulty chemistry and astronomy, and beyond incredibly misguided public policy—this “C02/ pollution/ global warming” pseudoscience may be the largest hoax ever foisted on the American people and the world.
It ranks with “eugenics”— the pseudoscience disaster of the early 20th century.
Public policy take note.
Scientists take note.
Unguarded science can morph into something quite different if you let it.
This equation is a synopsis of C02 / ocean water chemistry.
C02 has retrograde solubility- i.e.-more C02 is dissolved in water with a cooler temperature (4% more solubility per 1 degree C. fall in temp) therefore removing C02 from the atmosphere and forming bicarbonate ion and carbonate – and extending eventually to the formation of calcium carbonate rocks.
. Heat shifts the equation to the left with gradual atmospheric C02 liberation with ocean warming.
Atmospheric C02 concentration is primarily determined by temperature rather than the other way around.
This is easily demonstrated in the laboratory and it has been shown to be the case in ice core samples on several continents that prehistoric atmospheric C02 concentration follows atmospheric temperature changes by several hundred years—not the reverse.
This C02 variation is best seen in long 50,000-100,000 year glacial (cold) and interglacial (warm) periods.
It is now seen in shorter cycles – years and decades – as discussed below.
The main sink of atmospheric C02 is HC03- and dissolved C02 in the oceans which is 61 times atm.C02.
The largest reservoir of C02 is CaC03 in carbonate rocks (limestone), dolomite, and calcites, etc.
which is 141,000 times the amt of C02 in the atmosphere.
This equation has been shifting left and right during short, medium and long solar cycles (warm and cold periods) for more than a billion years.
Only .035% of the atmosphere is C02.
Only 3% of this C02 comes from fossil fuels.
This is 0.001% or 1/100,000 of all atmospheric molecules are anthropogenic C02.
Consider this with the knowledge that C02 levels were 20X higher in the Cambrian period (550 million yrs.
ago) when there was an explosion of plant and animal life.
Even in the 200 million year ago Jurassic period C02 was 5X present levels.
C02 decreased ~ 50 million years ago due to changes in outgasing from ocean ridges, volcanoes, and increased carbon burial.
In the past 400,000 years C02 has varied between 180-380ppm.
During this time lower C02 levels have tracked 100,000 yr. cold glaciations and higher C02 levels have followed warm interglacial periods.
Interestingly, these glacial cycles coincide with the 100,000 year earth/sun orbital eccentricity cycles.
Earth’s surface has probably cooled slightly the past 10 years.
It probably warmed slightly from 1975-1998.
It cooled from 1949-1975.
It warmed from 1750-1940 after spending~400 years in the Little Ice Age.
It cooled from the Medieval Warm period from 1000 AD - 1750 AD (LIAge).
It really cooled from the Holocene Warm Maximum ~5000 BCE to any subsequent or present date.
Any temperature prior to 11000 years ago was cooler than present due to the 90,000 year Wurm Glaciation, and there were dozens,perhaps hundreds, of these glaciations and interglacial warm peaks in the millions of years before that.
There were at least 4 Snow Ball earths in the past 2 billion years.
Whether we compare ice ages, millennia, centuries or our own experience with decades, years, months and days—our climate surface temperature varies - on longer time frames with the sun/earth obliquity, precession and eccentricity cycles and on shorter periods with sunspot/sun rotation cycles and water vapor cloud cover.
Other solar influences include cosmic ray fluxes and UV absorption induced local climate reversals.
Recent observations suggest even Mars has warmed over several decades.
Our Sun clearly controls our surface temperature.
Atmospheric C02 depends of this temperature variation—it does not cause it.
Atmospheric C02 seems to have increased this century.
Of course it has.
The surface temperature has increased!
This has been the warmest century in hundreds of years.
It’s no coincidence that the sunspot cycle has been maximal this past century.
It’s also no coincidence that we are finally coming out of the Little Ice Age (which had no sun spots).

Addressing the worst economic recession in generations calls for the most effective economic stimulus package that can be devised, not a stimulus package that is diminished in effectiveness through excessive bells and whistles meant to address a myriad of other (legitimate) social concerns.
And, likewise, getting serious about global climate change will require the enactment and implementation of meaningful, dedicated climate policies, most likely a comprehensive national CO
In other words, green jobs constrain fiscal policy and green jobs in fiscal policy constrains climate policy.
"In other words, green jobs constrain fiscal policy and green jobs in fiscal policy constrains climate policy.
"
Whatever the fortunate outcome that environmental policy didn't overtake the fiscal stimulus, the green jobs idea is still out there.
The debate is still on.
In 1990, when Congress sought to cut sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions from coal-fired power plants by 50% to reduce acid rain, Senator Robert Byrd (West Virginia) argued against the proposal for a national cap-and-trade system, because it would displace Appalachian coal mining jobs through reduced demand for high-sulfur coal.
He recommended instead a national requirement for all plants to install scrubbers, which would have increased costs nationally by $1 billion per year in perpetuity.
Fortunately, Senator Ted Kennedy (Massachusetts) recognized that these two problems (acid rain and displaced miners) called for two separate policy instruments.
Simultaneous with the passage of the Clean Air Act amendments of 1990, which established the path-breaking SO2 allowance trading program, Congress passed a job training and compensation initiative for Appalachian coal miners, at a one-time cost of $250 million.
Acid rain was cut by 50%, $1 billion per year was saved for the economy, and sensible and meaningful aid was provided to the displaced miners.
Two different policies were used to address two different purposes.
Sometimes that is the wisest course.
Environmental policy can change the mix of jobs but not the overall number of jobs.
An economy CAN become greener.
This is implicit in my original post.
I should have made it explicit and I will in the Env-Econ 101 piece but I didn't think that part of the message would be so easily overlooked.
Green jobs ARE bogus.
At least in today's political climate where politicians are promising 5 million green jobs without mentioning the cost (i.e., the loss of jobs in other sectors).
I don't get it actually.
Are you telling me that the 6% of the stimulus bill constrains climate response more than the 94%?
You confused about why anyone would claim victory?
Not so much victory but I'm glad the fiscal stimulus didn't go overboard on green stuff since a debate over enviromental policy spending might yield better environmental policy.
But, I'm worried that (only (only is $56 billion these days?
wow) 6% addressing climate will crowd out climate policy that most economists think will work better than weatherization and subsidies for renewable energy.
$56b or $100b, however we add up the green, is going to be big in environmental policy discussions during 2009.
We can go on: green jobs constrain education policies, health care programs, highway improvements, winning the war in Afghanistan, and so on.
Likewise, education policies constrain environmental improvements, health care reform, etc.
Continuing, infrastructure maintenance constrains climate policies (or flip it), education expenditures, etc.

blog). That is a very nice service to the profession.
"Global warming has stopped and a cooling is beginning.
No climate model has predicted a cooling of the Earth – quite the contrary.
And this means that the projections of future climate are unreliable.
" (source: Henrik Svensmark )
All the indicators show that global warming is still happening.
When looking for evidence of global warming, there are many different indicators that we should look for.
Whilst it's natural to start with air temperatures, a more thorough examination should be as inclusive as possible; snow cover, ice melt, air temperatures over land and sea, even the sea temperatures themselves.
A 2010 study included 10 key indicators, and as shown below, every one of them is moving in the direction expected of a warming globe.
The question of global warming stopping is often raised in the light of a recent weather event - a big snowfall or drought breaking rain.
Global warming is entirely compatible with these events; after all they are just weather.
For climate change, it is the long term trends that are important; measured over decades or more, and those long term trends show that the globe is still, unfortunately, warming.
New York Times has an article, "Skeptics on Human Climate Impact Seize on Cold Spell" , featuring quotes from prominent climate scientists and skeptics, that highlights the dangers of mistaking short-term weather for long-term climate trends.
Thank you for a website that provides information without a political agenda.
I would like to understand the global warming debate without feeling like I am being manipulated by someone with a political agenda and most web-sites seem to promote an agenda for one side or the other.
Thanks.
If the ocean has warmed to this extent, it must surely have expelled many millions of extra tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere.
Australis: Just because the ocean has absorbed so much heat does not not mean that its temperature has increased a lot.
That is because water has a high specific heat capacity.
A few degrees of warming does imply that water could hold (at maximum) less CO2; however its CO2 content is largely a function of the equilibrium with the atmosphere.
As atmospheric CO2 concentrations rise, the oceans will continue to absorb more CO2 despite their increasing temperatures.
(Once they get close to carbonated water as we find in soft drinks, then a few degrees of temperature change could make a big difference!
:-P )
And now my question: Figure 1 could also be used to advance the idea that the oceans have a tremendous ability to buffer us (on land) from global warming, and that while things may change, the consequences may be overstated.
I know there are potential holes in that reasoning, but I'd appreciate links to science addressing the extension of this topic to the potential impacts.
My question: Wouldn't it be possible that the heat contet of oceans rise even after radiative forcing has stopped changing?
I would assume that the "response time" of oceans to global warming is much longer than that of the atmosphere because of the drastic differences in their heat capacities.
My understanding is that is not warming enough to be able to confirm that an increased greenhouse effect is causing global warming.
Also it's not warming enough in the right area which is supposed to be in the Troposphere at around 10km.
Has this suddenly changed?
Some 3,000 scientific robots that are plying the ocean have sent home a puzzling message.
These diving instruments suggest that the oceans have not warmed up at all over the past four or five years.
That could mean global warming has taken a breather.
Or it could mean scientists aren't quite understanding what their robots are telling them
But Josh Willis at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory says the oceans are what really matter when it comes to global warming.
In fact, 80 percent to 90 percent of global warming involves heating up ocean waters.
They hold much more heat than the atmosphere can.
So Willis has been studying the ocean with a fleet of robotic instruments called the Argo system.
The buoys can dive 3,000 feet down and measure ocean temperature.
Since the system was fully deployed in 2003, it has recorded no warming of the global oceans
Response: Josh Willis is right.
Over 90% of global warming goes into the oceans.
Some studies of upper ocean heat (using the "3000 robots" that comprise the Argo network) have shown cooling over the last few years during a time when the Pacific has transitioned from El Nino to La Nina conditions.
However, when the Argo data is examined to greater depths, down to 2000 metres, it's seen that the ocean is still accumulating heat ( von Schuckmann 2009 ):
From this numbers is clear that if the Termohaline Circulation Shut Down then a BLAST OF HEAT will occur in the Upper Ocean and Atmosphere.
Is there any current Climate Model of how much the warming will accelerate if the Termohaline Circulation Shut Down?
There is no global warming that is taking place at the moment.
Sooner than later, it will be established that CO2 driven global warming is the greatest scientific stuff up of all times.
the fact that we still cannot identify the details of how heat goes around in the climate system in the short term (four years is not that much) should not rise any alarm.
Altough some phenomena show a (sort of) cyclic behaviour they all average out in the long run.
For example, look here for the PDO .
In the end, they could at best justify some "noise" in the trend; no overall energy balance has been altered and these "oscillation" can just move around the heat through the climate system.
we get always back to the same point, short and long term.
There's nothing wrong in the data, just not accurate enough to details the short term variability which we all would like to account for.
The long term global warming is put aside and not questioned at all by Trenberth.
"It relates to our ability to track energy flow through the climate system.
We can do this very well from 1992 to 2003, when large warming occurred, but not from 2004 to 2008.
The quote refers to our observation system which is inadequate to observe Earth's energy flows at the accuracy needed to understand small fluctuations in climate;"
Is 1998 "cherry picking one year?
" No.
It's one year of natural variability - but 11, going on 12, years of CO2 emissions.
And 1998 is warmer than - or if you use GISS, within 0.01 deg C as warm as, each year since then.
If 11 becomes 15 or 20, that's the skeptics' point - - if the climate is as CO2-sensitive as is thought, then no single year of natural variability should offset two decades of cumulative CO2 buildup.
However, I am an experimentalist.
The second comment I would like to pose is about taking temperature data.
The scope of the experiment is that the earth's surface area is 200,000,000 mi^2, and temperature data from 1880 - 1961(Tiros I launched) was taken with < 1,000-10,000 thermometers and averaged to get a full year's average temperature.
Making a gross assumption that the thermometers are homogeneously dispursed around the globe, each thermometer must have encompassed a region from >20,000 - 200,000 mi^2.
To put that into perspective, Texas is 250,000 mi^2 and West Virginia is approximately 25,000 mi^2.
I question whether the data obtained can produce an average annual temperature value within 0.5°C, let alone 0.1°C.
If these values are certain, as given by Smith and Reynolds (2004,2005) found on the NOAA website, I question what can be deduced from them.
The average surface temperature of the earth is not measured directly just like the temperatures from past climates were not measured directly.
However, past climates deviated in degrees over millenia compared to tenths of a degree over decades.
The same analysis goes for any water temperature measurement that was done.
To derive an average water temperature from measurements of an ocean that is on the order of 100,000,000 mi^2 in surface area and on the order of 0.25 miles deep is unfounded.
It is a vast volume to extrapolate precise and accurate temperature data from.
The climate models always predicted that after 2010 we would begin to see record warming-is this 'that' beginning?
"Researchers for the first time have calculated the highest tolerable "wet-bulb" temperature and found that this temperature could be exceeded for the first time in human history in future climate scenarios if greenhouse gas emissions continue at their current rate.
"
"Geologist Declares 'global warming is over' -- Warns U.S. Climate Conference of 'Looming Threat of Global Cooling' "
I'm sorry but I think I'm missing something.
Both surface and atmospheric measurements show cooling, or, at least, minimal warming since 2002.
How can the planet be accumulating heat when over the course of 8 years global temperature records show it has not really warmed at all?
If we happen to be in one of the 'abrupt' climate changes, we can expect temperature increases within a few years to a few decades, depending on the causality, to increase right past the sweet spot at which humans can survive.
Potentially thirty to fifty degrees Fahrenheit warmer.
We have an historical record of those sorts of temperatures.
And that assumes the 20 BILLION tons of CO2 we are happily pumping into the atmosphere annually is not a factor.
That the 7 billion people on earth are not a factor.
That the hydrological cycle is beginning to fluctuate is not a factor.
That the annual loss of millions of Hectares of arable land to erosion and millions more to desertification are not factors.
Because, in fact, they are no longer factors if we have jumped the shark.
The tropics have encroached into sub-tropical zones by four degrees of longitude in the recent past.
The weather, never predictable, was at least stable within recorded history.
Now it isn't.
Now EVERY flood is a 'hundred year' or 'thousand year' flood.
Now there are going to be hurricanes for which another level of intensity will have to be made.
Category 6.
Now the once-predictable seasons of the year are changing.
Everywhere. Given that weather is dynamic, I still defy anyone to tell me the weather where they are is not anomalous.
Climate change, clean and efficient energy and environmental protection are among the greatest challenges facing the United States and China.
Cooperation between the United States and China is critical to enhancing energy security, combating climate change, and protecting the environment and natural resources through pollution control and other measures.
Cooperation on climate change, clean and efficient energy and environmental protection can serve as a pillar of the bilateral relationship, build mutual trust and respect, and lay the foundation for constructive engagement between the United States and China for years to come, while also contributing to multilateral cooperation.
The purpose of this Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is to strengthen and coordinate our respective efforts to combat global climate change, promote clean and efficient energy, protect the environment and natural resources, and support environmentally sustainable and low-carbon economic growth.
Both countries commit to respond vigorously to the challenges of energy security, climate change and environmental protection through ambitious domestic action and international cooperation.
Toward this end, both countries intend to transition to a low-carbon economy, carry out policy dialogue and cooperate on capacity building and research, development and deployment of climate-friendly technology.
10) Combating climate change and promoting low-carbon economic growth
This MOU is to be co-chaired by the Department of State and Department of Energy on the U.S. side and the National Development and Reform Commission on the Chinese side.
The Participants intend to hold regular ministerial consultations to deepen mutual understanding and promote and guide bilateral cooperation on climate change, clean and efficient energy and environmental protection through a range of mechanisms, including:
The Participants also recognize the importance of and are committed to strengthening the EcoPartnerships initiative under the TYF in promoting sub-national cooperation and public-private partnerships to meet climate change, clean and efficient energy, and environmental goals.
The Participants have decided to establish Climate Change Policy Dialogue and Cooperation as a platform for the United States and China to address global climate change and to identify and resolve areas of concern.
Consistent with equity and their common but differentiated responsibilities, and respective capabilities, the United States and China recognize they have a very important role in combating climate change.
The United States and China will work together to further promote the full, effective and sustained implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
The Participants concur that their Climate Change Policy Dialogue and Cooperation should promote (i) discussion and exchange of views on domestic strategies and policies for addressing climate change; (ii) practical solutions for promoting the transition to low-carbon economies; (iii) successful international negotiations on climate change; (iv) joint research, development, deployment, and transfer, as mutually agreed, of climate-friendly technologies; (v) cooperation on specific projects; (vi) adaptation to climate change; (vii) capacity building and the raising of public awareness; and (viii) pragmatic cooperation on climate change between cities, universities, provinces and states of the two countries.
The Participants intend to hold consultations between representatives of the two countries’ leaders on a regular basis.
The Participants may establish working groups or task forces involving relevant ministries as necessary to support the objectives of the Climate Change Policy Dialogue and Cooperation.
Fast Forward is equal parts science primer, history lesson, policy prescription, and ethical treatise.
This pithy and compelling book makes clear what we know and don’t know about global warming; why the threat demands prudent and urgent action; why the transition to a low-carbon economy will be the most difficult political and economic transaction in history; and how it requires nothing less than a revolution in our sense of civic responsibility.
William Antholis and Strobe Talbott guide the reader through two decades of climate change diplomacy, explaining the national and international factors that have influenced and often impeded the negotiations.
Their brisk narrative includes behind-the-scenes coverage of Barack Obama’s impromptu meeting with key leaders in Copenhagen that broke a logjam and salvaged an agreement.
The near-disaster of that summit demonstrated how the United Nations cannot move forward fast enough to produce a global deal.
Instead, the “Big Four” of the United States, the European Union, China, and India must drive the next stage of the process.
Antholis and Talbott also recommend a new international mechanism modeled on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that would monitor national commitments and create incentives for other countries to coordinate their efforts to cut emissions.
Antholis and Talbott put their recommendations for immediate congressional and diplomatic action into the larger context of our obligation to future generations.
They note that this theme is stressed by a diverse coalition of religious leaders who are calling for ambitious political action on climate change.
The world we leave to our children and grandchildren is not an abstraction, or even just a legacy; we must think about what kind of world that will be in deciding how we live—and act—today.
On May 12, senators John Kerry and Joe Lieberman introduced the American Power Act.
The proposed law — crafted with the help of Republican Senator Lindsey Graham — brought together a number of elements proposed by environmental groups and businesses to set the country on a new, clean-energy path.
As the bill is considered, Kerry and Lieberman will focus on the need to create jobs after the Great Recession and to promote alternatives to fossil fuels.
Those who support the legislation will generally play down a politically more complicated purpose: fighting global warming.
Surprisingly, perhaps, it is Graham who has been most forceful in making the case for effective steps to counter climate change.
"I have been to enough college campuses to know — if you are 30 or younger, this climate issue is not a debate," he told New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman in February.
"It's a value ... From a Republican point of view, we should buy into it and embrace it and not belittle them.
"
Graham is a tough partisan, and he was making a point about the future of the GOP, which he thinks needs younger people in its ranks.
Crucially, he also believes that lowering the risk to the planet and the human race from climate change qualifies as a conservative cause.
His exhortation, if taken to heart, could prompt Republicans and Democrats to compete for young, environmentally conscious voters.
At a time of partisan squabbling, that would benefit us all.
Coauthor William Antholis discusses the book and the global impact from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on ABC News World View .
Antholis answers the question, “Who is to Blame?”
"Strobe Talbott and Bill Antholis–head and senior fellow respectively of the Brookings Institution, and former stalwarts of the Clinton administration–prefer to describe Copenhagen as a "useful disappointment".
In their very timely and fast-paced account of where we are today on the politics of global warming, the authors see Copenhagen as having pointed up the futility of relying on the United Nations as the only vehicle through which to tackle climate change.
"Indeed, as the authors observe, it was fashionable in the midst of last February’s snowstorm in Washington for Republicans to make jokes about the onset of global warming.
Jim DeMint, a famously sceptical senator from South Carolina, even built an impromptu igloo on Capitol Hill to highlight the punchline.
"
“Strobe Talbott and Bill Antholis have made an admirable and important effort to move beyond the recent political rancor in Washington.
They have a plan for leaders who want to be serious about energy and climate.
Instead of starting from entrenched ideological base camps, they concentrate on identifying common goals.
Reducing our foreign oil dependence, saving Americans money on their energy bills, improving our industrial competitiveness, investing in a cleaner and more diverse energy portfolio, and using domestic fossil fuel resources wisely, while cutting our greenhouse gas emissions are goals on which Republicans and Democrats alike can agree.”
“Fast Forward makes the case in clear, concise, and compelling terms for urgent action and American leadership in addressing the threat that global warming poses to our nation and our planet.”
“In Fast Forward William Antholis and Strobe Talbott brilliantly explode the economic and scientific myths about climate change while elevating the political debate to a transgenerational moral crisis.
Their synthesis of science, economics, religion and philosophy is a clarion call to action for anyone interested in the future of the planet—which means all of us.
"
"Fast Forward is a very rare book about global warming—both sophisticated historically and politically, but also actually engaging!
The authors place the challenge within the moral tradition that helped avert the other great modern planetary threat: nuclear holocaust.
Succinct and sweeping in scope, despite its brevity, this is the book for briefing busy CEOs and prime ministers contemplating whether this 'climate thing' is real and, if it is, how should we deal with it.
"
“William Antholis and Strobe Talbott combine a concise, fast-paced narrative on the evolution of climate change as a national and international issue with a framework for policy that is rooted in deep understanding and practical experience of international affairs.
The result is a timely perspective on something whose outcome—whatever the ultimate choices—will be of truly global significance in both environmental and economic terms.”
William Antholis is managing director of the Brookings Institution, where he is also a senior fellow in Governance Studies .
During Bill Clinton’s presidency, he was director of international economic affairs at the National Security Council and the National Economic Council.
He served as deputy director of the White House climate change policy team and was a negotiator on the U.S. team at Kyoto.
If global warming maintains its current pace, the Northeast will be transformed, a new report says.
The ski industry, such as that in Vermont, could disappear.
(By Toby Talbot -- Associated Press)
These are among the conclusions of a two-year study by the public interest group Union of Concerned Scientists on the effects of global warming in the Northeast if current greenhouse gas emission patterns worldwide continue unabated.
Winters would be on average 8 to 12 degrees higher by the end of the century, and summers 6 to 14 degrees higher.
Given those conditions, the group said in a report released yesterday, the environment of the Northeast would be transformed, and cities such as Boston, Atlantic City and New York would be regularly subject to disastrous flooding.
The report -- the work of more than 50 top university and government-based researchers -- is one of numerous efforts to localize the potential effects of global warming.
Frumhoff was also the lead author on the impact and mitigation report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world's leading group of climatologists.
Some have argued that the effects of global warming would be positive as well as negative, and Frumhoff acknowledged that there would be advantages to a warmer Northeast.
Some farmers, for instance, would have a longer growing season, and residents in more northern areas might need less fuel in the winter.
But overall, he said, the effect would be overwhelmingly disruptive and costly.
Even under the best-case emission-lowering scenario, global warming would cause unprecedented damage to the coastline and would result in enormous expenditures to maintain and replace roads and other infrastructure.
In a worst-case scenario, apple orchards would wither, and lobstermen south of Maine and cod fishermen plying the Georges Bank would lose their livelihoods.
Because of the rising temperatures, the Northeast would be susceptible to longer and more severe droughts because of the increased evaporation of rainfall.
In a similar finding, scientists wrote in the journal Science in April that long-term droughts would probably become common in the American Southwest as the planet warms.
Some of the changes are already inevitable, the report says, because greenhouse gases emitted today stay in the atmosphere for decades.
Nonetheless, it says that a low-emission alternative is achievable and would leave the Northeast with a similar climate.
It would not be easy, because richer nations would have to cut their carbon dioxide emissions by mid-century to 80 percent below 2000 levels, and developing nations would have to make deep cuts, too.
Climate Change.
Rising temperatures, melting glaciers, extreme weather events, changing habitats and seasons: an overwhelming number of natural signals indicate that climate change is well underway.
Governments and industries are now developing plans and technologies for a lower carbon, more energy efficient future.
But to succeed, we need to dovetail our efforts to realize productive results and economies of scale.
The time has absolutely come to see, discuss, and act upon what we now most certainly know—that visible changes in our environment are transforming the way we must approach the business, personal, and economic decisions we make in our lives today.
Now is the time to thoughtfully examine these complex issues as well as adaptation strategies that decrease exposure to the risks posed by climate change.
Multiple factors are now in play, making this the most exciting time in history to be at the table when the issues of climate change are discussed.
From California's multi-billion dollar corporations to smaller community governments and stakeholder groups--everyone has an important role as part of the solution.
What is less certain is how we band together, how we decide to move forward in harmony with the policies and legislation put forth by a new administration.
Along with its co-hosts, CAPCOA is proud to have presented The CAPCOA Climate Change Forum on August 30-31, 2010 at the Marriott Marquis Hotel in San Francisco, California.
This event marks one more step toward achieving a cleaner, greener, and more energy efficient tomorrow and advancing the critical discussions about climate change.
EL MONTE, Calif -The Air Resources Board set in place today two important building blocks in California's fight to slow the impacts of global warming when it approved a greenhouse gas emissions limit for 2020 and adopted regulations requiring mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases for large facilities.
Both items were required under AB32, California's landmark climate change legislation.
AB32, also known as The Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, was signed by Governor Schwarzenegger in September 2006 and requires that California reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020.
The 1990 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Level establishes the actual number of tons of emissions that California is required to reach.
The Board also adopted the state's first-ever rules and requirements for the largest facilities in California to report their annual greenhouse gas emissions.
California's ARB staff has spent the past year assembling an inventory of the state's 1990 emissions using a variety of data sources, including inputs related to fuel combustion, industrial processes, and agricultural practices.
That figure is 427 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.
Preliminary estimates indicate that 2020 emission projections could be 600 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent if no actions are taken to reduce greenhouse gases-the so-called 'business-as-usual' scenario.
This means that California must prevent 173 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent from being emitted by 2020 in order to meet the 1990 level as required by AB32.
ARB staff used accepted international guidance to develop the inventory and calculated the total emissions of six greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide (by far the largest single gas with 89 percent of the total), methane, nitrous oxide, and three gases used mainly in industrial applications.
Each greenhouse gas has a different global warming potential.
A ton of methane, for example, has 21 times the global warming potential as a ton of carbon dioxide.
The final figure of 427 million metric tons of carbon dioxide was arrived at by giving each gas its global warming potential weight., (By comparison, 200,000 passenger cars driven for a full year produce about one million tons of carbon dioxide.
)
A series of early actions, tailpipe regulations and the development of fuels with less carbon in them are estimated to provide reductions totaling 66 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.
ARB staff are currently developing a Scoping Plan to develop programs and measures to address the remaining 107 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in order to reach the total of 173 million tons by 2020.
That plan will be submitted to the Board in November, 2008.
The mandatory reporting regulations require annual reporting from the largest facilities in the state, accounting for 94 percent of greenhouse gas emissions from industrial and commercial stationary sources in California.
(Transportation sources, which account for 38 percent of California's total greenhouse gas emissions are not covered by these regulations but will continue to be tracked through existing means.
) The standards and approaches to reporting were developed in close consultation with the California Climate Action Registry, as required by the law.
The stakeholder process included five public workshops and 15 technical workgroup meetings, as well as numerous other meetings and teleconferences and extensive coordination with other state agencies.
There are about 800 separate sources that fall under the new reporting rules and include electricity generating facilities, electricity retail providers and power marketers, oil refineries, hydrogen plants, cement plants, cogeneration facilities, and industrial sources that emit over 25,000 tons of carbon dioxide each year from on-site stationary source combustions such as large furnaces.
This last category includes a diverse range of facilities such as food processing, glass container manufacturers, oil and gas production and mineral processing.
Backup generators, schools and hospitals are excluded from the requirements.

Adjustment in natural or human systems to a new or changing environment.
Adaptation to climate change refers to adjustment in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities.
Various types of adaptation can be distinguished, including anticipatory and reactive adaptation, private and public adaptation, and autonomous and planned adaptation.
Reduction in emissions by sources or enhancement of removals by sinks that is additional to any that would occur in the absence of a Joint Implementation or a Clean Development Mechanism project activity as defined in the Kyoto Protocol Articles on Joint Implementation and the Clean Development Mechanism.
This definition may be further broadened to include financial, investment, and technology additionality.
Under financial additionality, the project activity funding shall be additional to existing Global Environmental Facility, other financial commitments of Parties included in Annex I, Official Development Assistance, and other systems of co-operation.
Under investment additionality, the value of the Emissions Reduction Unit /Certified Emission Reduction Unit shall significantly improve the financial and/or commercial viability of the project activity.
Under technology additionality, the technology used for the project activity shall be the best available for the circumstances of the host Party.
The group was formed during the Second World Climate Conference in 1990 and comprises small island and low-lying coastal developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse consequences of climate change, such as sea level rise, coral bleaching, and the increased frequency and intensity of tropical storms.
With more than 35 states from the Atlantic, Caribbean, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean, and Pacific, AOSIS share common objectives on environmental and sustainable development matters in the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) process.
Refer to a variety of possible scenarios for societal values and consumption and production patterns in all countries, including but not limited to a continuation of today’s trends.
In this Report, these paths do not include additional climate initiatives which means that no scenarios are included that explicitly assume implementation of the UNFCCC or the emission targets of the Kyoto Protocol, but do include assumptions about other policies that influence greenhouse gas emissions indirectly.
The ancillary, or side effects, of policies aimed exclusively at climate change mitigation.
Such policies have an impact not only on greenhouse gas emissions, but also on resource use efficiency, like reduction in emissions of local and regional air pollutants associated with fossil fuel use, and on issues such as transportation, agriculture, land-use practices, employment, and fuel security.
Sometimes these benefits are referred to as “ancillary impacts” to reflect that in some cases the benefits may be negative.
From the perspective of policies directed at abating local air pollution, greenhouse gas mitigation may also be considered an ancillary benefit, but these relationships are not considered in this assessment.
See also co-benefits.
Emissions of greenhouse gases, greenhouse gas precursors, and aerosols associated with human activities.
These include burning of fossil fuels for energy, deforestation and land-use changes that result in net increase in emissions.
Group of countries included in Annex I (as amended in 1998) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, including all the developed countries in the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development, and Economies in transition.
By default, the other countries are referred to as Non-Annex I countries.
Under Articles 4.2 (a) and 4.2 (b) of the Convention, Annex I countries commit themselves specifically to the aim of returning individually or jointly to their 1990 levels of greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2000.

Group of countries included in Annex B in the Kyoto Protocol that have agreed to a target for their greenhouse gas emissions, including all the Annex I countries (as amended in 1998) but Turkey and Belarus.
See also Annex II, Non-Annex I, and Non-Annex B countries/Parties.
Under the Kyoto Protocol, the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions that each Annex B country has agreed that its emissions will not exceed in the first commitment period (2008 to 2012) is the assigned amount.
This is calculated by multiplying the country’s total greenhouse gas emissions in 1990 by five (for the 5-year commitment period) and then by the percentage it agreed to as listed in Annex B of the Kyoto Protocol (e.g., 92% for the European Union; 93% for the USA).

Students to Raise Awareness of Climate Change and Engage Communities in Action
SACRAMENTO: Air Resources Board Chairman Mary Nichols and the British Council introduced California’s 10 high school “ Climate Champions ” today on the steps of the State Capitol building in Sacramento.
As the U.S. representatives of British Council’s International Climate Champions, the members of the California program will educate peers and local communities on the impacts of climate change and will encourage individual action to address the causes of climate change.
Each Climate Champion will undertake an individual project over the next year to tackle the causes of climate change and engage peers in taking action:
Soraya Okuda, San Francisco (Lowell High School): Soraya hopes to create a composting system in the Stonestown Galleria Mall and at San Francisco State University’s food courts to reduce the amount of biodegradable food that gets processed with trash.
Elizabeth Valencia, Antioch (Antioch High School): Elizabeth will write and produce a play to inform students at Bay Area schools about climate change and the risks of not taking action now.
Andrea White, Placentia (Valencia High School): Andrea will work with local officials to replace non-native plants that draw too heavily on the local water supply with more drought-resistant native varieties.
“This bright new group of champions will build on the success of last year’s program as they continue to work together to inspire all Californians to tackle climate change,” Nichols said.
“As ARB moves forward with implementing California’s climate change goals, these champions will help us by advancing innovative solutions for what lies ahead of us, and change their future for the better.”
ARB and British Council staff selected the champions based on their dedication to tackling climate change, their communication skills and their commitment to undertaking greenhouse gas-reducing projects in their schools and communities.
“The British Council and our partner, the California Air Resources Board, are delighted to welcome the 2009 California Climate Champions.
I look forward to witnessing the contributions that each of these extraordinary young people will make over the coming year as they build on the enthusiasm and success of the 2008 California Climate Champions,” said Sharon Memis, director of the British Council United States.
Now in its second year, the California Climate Champions program welcomes the new champions who will join a peer network of 15 California Climate Champions from 2008.
ABOUT INTERNATIONAL CLIMATE CHAMPIONS: British Council International Climate Champions range in age from 11 to 35 years, varying by the country in which the program operates.
In 2008 the program grew to encompass more than 800 International Climate Champions in 29 countries, and in 2009 there are plans to expand to 60 countries across the globe, recruiting over 1,300 young people who are passionate about and committed to taking action on climate change.
British Council and its partners help these young people develop and implement projects within their local communities that raise awareness of climate change, limit its impact and reduce carbon emissions.
ABOUT THE BRITISH COUNCIL : The British Council is the United Kingdom’s international non-profit organization for cultural relations and education opportunities.
In the US, we increase recognition of the wide range of learning opportunities available in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and facilitate educational cooperation between the US and UK.

The proposed regulation released today would diversify the variety of fuels and boost the market for alternative-fuel vehicles.
It is one of the most important early actions called for under AB 32, California's pioneering climate change legislation, and will achieve 16 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emission reductions by 2020.
"The real strength of this standard is that it takes a comprehensive 'cradle to grave' approach that accounts for greenhouse gas emissions from production, transport and tailpipe emissions," said ARB Chairman Mary Nichols.
"The new standard will promote the development of alternative fuels that can provide economic opportunities, slash greenhouse gas emissions, and reduce criteria pollutants and toxic air contaminants.
It will help consumers by injecting competition into the transportation fuel market and set California on a course to benefit from technological innovation, energy diversification and economic development.
"
AB 32, signed by the Governor in 2006, is California's Global Warming Solutions Act that set in law aggressive greenhouse gas reduction targets (1990 levels by 2020).
AB 32 set the goals, but the solution is prescribed in the Scoping Plan which utilizes a mix of a cap-and-trade program, along with complimentary measures.
The LCFS is included in the Scoping Plan as one of the solutions for California to meet its AB 32 goals.

The local government operations protocol provides a consistent methodology to develop greenhouse gas emission inventories for California's local governments, including cities and towns.
The protocol lays out specific guidelines in how local governments can assess emissions from buildings and facilities; streetlights and traffic signals; water delivery and wastewater treatment facilities; ports and airports; vehicle and transit fleets; power generation facilities; solid waste facilities; and other process and fugitive emissions.
ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability and several other stakeholders assisted in developing the protocol.
The manure digester project protocol provides standardized accounting methodology for projects that reduce greenhouse gases such as methane and carbon dioxide through optimal waste management practices, from storage, disposal and transport.
By using data on a facility's animals, manure handling processes, environmental conditions, carbon dioxide combustion, and digester-related equipment and biogas, the protocol calculates the amount of methane that would have been otherwise released if the digester had not been capturing and destroying the gas.
ARB worked with the California Climate Action Registry and a number of other stakeholder groups in developing the protocols to quantify greenhouse gas emissions and emissions reduction projects throughout the state for use in voluntary actions, while specifics of the Global Warming Solutions Act (AB32) are still being developed.
ARB staff is working to determine how emission reductions from early voluntary actions, including any from using the protocols adopted today, could eventually be used officially for compliance purposes as part of the state's implementation of AB32.
Governor Schwarzenegger signed the Global Warming Solutions Act two years ago this week.
Since then, ARB staff have laid out the strategy to meet the program's goals in the form of the draft scoping plan, and have developed numerous specific regulations targeted at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from a variety of sources throughout the state.

ARB Chairman, Dr. Alan Lloyd said, "This landmark decision sets a course for California that is likely to be copied throughout the U.S. and other countries.
Because of its forward-thinking approach, the ARB has established itself as the world leader in setting motor vehicle pollution control standards.
Those standards have led to automotive technologies that dominate the way cars are built today and have significantly cut air pollution's public health risk.
This regulation will have the same impact.
"
The regulation, which the ARB adopted after a marathon public hearing, results from legislation by Assemblywoman Fran Pavley (D-Agoura Hills) and passed in 2002.
The historic regulation sets limits on the amount of greenhouse gas emissions that can be released from new passenger cars, SUVs and pickup trucks sold in California starting in model year 2009.
The new regulation is based on a state of the art assessment of the various technologies and fuels that can reduce motor vehicle global warming pollutants.
The adoption of this rule makes California the nation's only state that has regulated motor vehicles for their contributions to global climate change.
At least seven other states including New York, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Vermont, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Maine, as well as the nation of Canada, are expected to consider adopting the regulation for their use.
If all of those states and Canada adopt the rule, the number of cars required to meet the rule will triple.
In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions the regulation is also expected to cut ozone-forming pollution by about five tons per day (TPD) by 2020.

SACRAMENTO - The California Air Resource Board (ARB) today announced the members of two advisory committees that will help determine how the sweeping Climate Change Initiative will be designed and how it will achieve the goals set forth in the landmark legislation the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (AB 32).
"Each of these committees will be essential to the development of the Climate Change Initiative as laid out in AB 32," said Dr. Robert F. Sawyer, ARB Chairman.
"We have found the best people for these important tasks.
They will be asked to accomplish a lot in a short period of time to help develop a program that is technically and economically sound and protective of our most vulnerable citizens.
"
The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 establishes a statewide target for greenhouse gas reductions by 2020 and requires the ARB to adopt a plan and individual measures to achieve the maximum technologically feasible and cost-effective reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.
All advisory committee meetings will be announced and open to the public.
A complete list of committee members is attached.

His top White House deputy on climate change and energy, Carol Browner, said in this report from Bloomberg News that “We feel very, very confident that we can work with the rest of the world to take significant steps forward in Copenhagen.” What concerns a lot of folks though - here in the US and in the community of nations, some of which have really been working very hard to effect something truly meaningful at the 15th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change - is that the US Senate, with only 26 days to go before the meetings in Copenhagen, is stuck in reverse.
As I’ve noted a number of times, including here most recently, the House has done its job and the President and his team are working very hard to make things happen, internationally and domestically.
The Senate, however, is throwing an awful lot of sand into the machinery.
Lobbyists Accused of Blocking Climate Change Efforts reports CBS’s BNET.
According to the Center for Public Integrity this is, to be fair, a global problem .
Efforts at reducing the world’s GHG emissions “…are being stymied by a far-reaching, multinational backlash led by fossil fuel industries and other heavy carbon emitters…” In America, even in the face of good-faith efforts by powerhouse groups of businesses like the United States Climate Action Partnership and Business for Innovative Climate and Energy Policy , the fossil fuel folks are spearheading opposition to cap-and-trade.
Well, Senator, it’s not just the Republicans.
Senator Baucus, the only member of the Environment Committee who voted against the bill, is having his own hearings in the Finance Committee that he chairs.
“Grist” had this to say: Senate Finance Committee calls on polluter lobbyists to defend pollution economy yet again .
Is Baucus trying to completely scuttle climate legislation in the Senate this year?
The “Financial Times” had some more to say on this last week here .
They’re writing about “Americans for Prosperity, the rightwing group that inflamed the healthcare debate over the summer and is set to do the same on climate change.” Follow the money though: “AFP is partly funded by the Koch Family Foundations, an offshoot of Koch Industries, the largest privately-owned US energy company, and receives other corporate funding, including from ExxonMobil in the past.”
Vice President Al Gore , Nobel Peace Laureate, venture capitalist, author, lecturer, Academy Award winner, activist, the man Denialists love to hate, and the man some others canonize as the path-breaking visionary on the threat of global climate change, has a new book out: Our Choice: A Plan to Solve the Climate Crisis .
It has a series of solutions and it’s a call to action for people all over the world.
Gore is making the rounds to both promote the book and to talk about the looming crossroads at Copenhagen .
The preeminent journalistic voice on climate change, Betsy Kolbert , interviewed Gore at her blog for “The New Yorker.” It’s a wide-ranging conversation and Gore’s optimistic about prospects, both for Copenhagen and beyond.
I had one cavil which I expressed in a comment there: “I’m somewhat at a loss, though, in reading this conversation, to note the absence of reference to greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide.
As we all know, methane, nitrous oxide, the F-gases, ozone and black carbon are all pernicious actors in warming and need to be addressed.” I think they both know this perfectly well, but there seems to be a sense that the issue has to be dumbed down for the general public, a perception that I challenged when Bill McKibben did it last summer in a book review.
In any event, Kolbert, McKibben, and Gore are three of the greatest rainbow warriors of our age and should be regarded as such.
Gore was at the American Museum of Natural History earlier this week and “Scientific American” covered the event .
Gore talked about population, a too-neglected part of the equation in the climate change calculus, and he talked about gender equality.
“Near-zero growth, however, could be attained with four basic societal achievements, he said.
The goals include: the education of girls, the empowerment of women, the spread of fertility management and a higher child survival rate.
Regardless of climate change, he noted, these aims are ‘all things we should be doing for good and beneficial reasons otherwise.’”
The good folks at Salon.com did an interview with him too.
Asked his expectations for Copenhagen, he said: “I think it is realistic to expect a treaty.
It will not be as strong as I would like it to be.
But it will put a price on carbon and change the forward planning of businesses and cities and states, provinces and nations.” Putting a price on carbon is one of the cornerstones of climate policy that the IPCC, the Stern Review, the EU, and most economists in the world concerned about the issue have all trumpeted.
In a happy coincidence, the author of the book I referred to in my post below on Meat , Bloodless Revolution, has a review of Gore’s book in this past weekend’s “FT.” Tristram Stuart’s highly laudatory review is itself very much worth reading.
He notes, among other things, Gore’s embrace of biosequestration as a vital tool in fighting climate change and his disavowal of the massive biofuel development for which he had formerly been an advocate.
(See, for example, my posts on biochar and Are Biofuels a Bummer?
)
As I noted yesterday, I’ll be visiting the subject of the intersection of animal agriculture and climate change more often here.
For now, I want to note two recent items, one a “NY Times” op-ed, the other a book review in the “New Yorker.” (Yes, I live in New York City.
)
This brings us to the subject of Betsy’s Kolbert’s “New Yorker” review of Jonathan Safran Foer’s Eating Animals.
Foer is a novelist, but delves into some new, not-uninteresting territory in this book.
He looks at the massive pollution engendered by industrial meat production.
“The pigs processed by a single company, Smithfield Foods, generate as much excrement as all of the human residents of the states of California and Texas combined.” And, “According to the Environmental Protection Agency, some thirty-five thousand miles of American waterways have been contaminated by animal excrement.” He looks at the extraordinary amounts of antibiotic pumped into animals we eat and how this has led directly to “…producing new, resistant strains of germs-so-called superbugs.” And he looks at the pain inflicted on the animals on which we feed.
Good review of what appears a most compelling book.
Not everybody would have caught the headline, but when you’re as tuned into Climate Change as I am - and many of you are - then Climate chief Lord Stern: give up meat to save the planet is going to grab your attention.
Who is Lord Nicholas Stern?
He is a world-class economist and leader of the UK’s seminal “ Stern Review on the economics of climate change “ that boosted the potential economic devastation of climate change into the forefront of public policy discussion.
When Lord Stern starts talking about animal agriculture as a concern, people are going to listen.
Not surprisingly, when someone as prominent as Stern makes a pronouncement as unequivocal - and controversial - as this one, there’s going to be a rapid backlash.
Thus, Critics round on Lord Stern over vegetarian call is a headline from the very next day from “The Times.” They wrote: “Farmers and meat companies across Britain reacted with a mixture of anger and exasperation yesterday after one of the world’s leading climate change campaigners urged people to become vegetarian to help to fight global warming.”
When another highly visible and respected climate change leader, Dr. Rajendra Pachauri, the chairman of the IPCC , delivered the same message a year ago, there was a not-dissimilar reaction.
See this from “The Guardian.”
There is a fair bit to be said on this subject - and I will be saying more here.
There are an awful lot of reasons why meat consumption is a big net negative for people and the planet, and climate change is high on the list.
There is a growing movement to highlight the connections.
Witness, for instance, this useful comment on a recent post.
I’ve been reading a great book on the history of vegetarianism, The Bloodless Revolution by Tristram Stuart, and find, quite to my surprise, that many of the same arguments made today regarding natural resource protection and the medical benefits of vegetarianism were made hundreds of years ago.
Pierre Gassendi, for instance, the 17th Century French philosopher and scientist, was a prominent proponent of a vegetarian diet.
As the book notes, “…Gassendi produced the mandate for philosophical vegetarianism, by proclaiming that ‘The entire purpose of philosophy ought to consist in leading men back to the paths of nature.’”
Whether you subscribe to the idea that we need to return to 350 ppm of carbon dioxide equivalent in the atmosphere or not, last Saturday’s worldwide expressions of concern were wonderful, eye-opening further evidence of how deep and how broad that concern runs.
I wrote a thumbnail sketch the other day of where we are in the US on domestic climate change and energy legislation.
Let’s now take a quick look at how things are shaping up only 37 days before Copenhagen.
As you know, the world has been building toward the 15th Conference of the Parties (COP 15) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) for several years.
COP 13, in Bali two years ago, created the “roadmap” for further talks under the UN’s aegis.
In Bali, for one thing, avoiding deforestation and forest degradation ( REDD ) was embraced as a necessary mechanism for an international agreement after the Kyoto Protocols expire in 2012.
For another thing, the idea that adaptation , with an adaptation funding mechanism, needed to be a key building block in “a strengthened future response to climate change” was established.
Copenhagen is where the international community is going to create the framework for how we proceed.
We will have a more vigorous regime than Kyoto provided.
The 1997 Kyoto Protocol , it should be recognized, was never meant to be the alpha and omega for addressing the climate crisis.
It should be celebrated, nevertheless, for the mechanisms that it established.
What we will have after Copenhagen is somewhat well defined in some areas, and as-yet unclear in others.
The big bones of contention remain to what extent the developing nations will adhere to a quantifiable program of greenhouse gas reductions, how much and in what way the developed countries will pay for mitigation and adaptation efforts in the developing world, and the new and improved mechanisms for achieving the climate-cooling ends nations agree are necessary.
What’s been going on as part of the preparations for COP 15?
The Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate (MEF), for one thing, has been having a series of meetings all year.
The MEF nations’ leaders met in Italy in July and made several declarations, among them that “Developing countries among us will promptly undertake actions whose projected effects on emissions represent a meaningful deviation from business as usual in the mid-term …” (My emphases.
) Developing nations represent a large burden of the GHG emissions now and there is plenty more ahead before any “meaningful deviations” start to kick in.
(China, Indonesia and Brazil are 1, 3 and 4 when you count Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry [LULUCF].
) These major developing economies, and others such as India, South Africa, and Mexico, all have a critical voice and a critical role to play in effecting a good agreement in Copenhagen.
Meeting just before the MEF, the G-8 called for a 50% reduction overall in greenhouse gases by 2050, the most advanced economies reducing by 80%.
In mid-September, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon organized the Summit on Climate Change .
A number of world leaders further delineated their intention to address climate change , in Copenhagen and beyond.
The G-20 Summit in Pittsburgh later that week produced a declaration of intent to end fossil-fuel subsidies worldwide, a not-inconsiderable outcome.
Just today, after a key EU Summit concluded , José Manuel Barroso, President of the European Commission announced: “We have a clear, ambitious, and unified EU message on climate finance.
We can take this message to Washington, New Delhi, Beijing and elsewhere.
Next Tuesday, Prime Minister Reinfeldt and myself are meeting the President of the United States and we will say ‘we are ready to engage, let’s make Copenhagen a success.’” John Fredrik Reinfeldt is the Prime Minister of Sweden.
(See also this video from Reuters on the EU agreement.
)
Another of the central players in all of this is Yvo de Boer, Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC.
In the latest monthly newsletter from them, he delivers an urgent, but I think positive message.
He talks about the successes in the Bangkok talks earlier this month.
He mentions the thousands of NGOs and faith groups that are working toward achieving success on climate and sustainability.
He calls on world leaders to follow through on the commitments they’ve been making to finalize a strong, smart and thorough agreement in Copenhagen.
As you know, there has been a tremendous amount of activity on climate change and energy on The Hill over the past year.
The House of Representatives got going fast, even before the 111th Congress got underway.
A leading progressive, hardball-playing Congressman from Los Angeles, Henry Waxman, assumed the chairmanship of the critical Energy and Commerce in a palace coup .
He created a new subcommittee, Energy and the Environment, and installed an outspoken Massachusetts progressive, Ed Markey, as the chair.
In late June, after a fair bit of horse trading among key legislators - plus some old-fashioned threats, cajolery and pleading from Speaker Pelosi and her team, and, it’s fair to assume, President Obama and his team - the landmark American Clean Energy and Security Act (H.R.
2454), aka Waxman-Markey, was passed in the House.
The vote was close, 219-212, but historic nonetheless.
There are extraordinary complexities to the politics, the psychology, and the economics.
Nevertheless, Waxman-Markey has become the touchstone for legislative action.
Next stop the Senate.
The Senate leadership, no doubt in full consultation with the House leadership and the White House, decided to put climate change and energy behind health as the focus for the summer and fall.
At the end of September, two forward-thinking, aggressive legislators, both renewable energy and environmental protection hawks, John Kerry, chair of the Foreign Relations Committee, and Barbara Boxer, committee chair for Environment and Public Works, started to turn up the tempo on climate change and energy.
They introduced the Clean Energy Jobs and American Power Act .
Boxer’s committee will hold three days of hearings this week, and mark-up on the bill is slated to commence the first week of November.
This climate change/energy initiative, so critical to the health and well being of the United States - much more so, I would not hesitate to venture, than health care reform - will likely not, according to all reports, make it into law this year, let alone before Copenhagen, but there’s a pretty solid foundation being laid for it for enactment in the second session of this Congress.
The folks at the White House, with President Obama very much driving them, are working assiduously on a number of fronts to make this legislation happen.
This article from the AP delves into how this is being manifested.
A large and growing group of top advisors now meet regularly on Obama’s green agenda.
There has been considerable outreach to mayors, governors, and members of Congress.
Carol Browner, the top White House official on climate and energy said: “It’s really engaging a wide array of people across the administration to make sure that we’re answering the questions that the Senate needs answered and working with individual members as they think about how they can support comprehensive energy legislation.
It’s just grown and grown and grown, with more and more Cabinet agencies and secretaries wanting to be involved.”
In the spirit of Step It Up 2007 and Earth Hour , 350.org reports that yesterday’s International Day of Climate Action brought people together in 181 countries, at over 5,200 events, for the “most widespread day of environmental action in the planet’s history.” See a great slide show plus videos and other reports here on this successful expression of the depth and breadth of people’s concern.
Don’t think this is an international effort?
There are over a dozen languages including Spanish, French, Russian, Arabic and Chinese in which you can read about the fun people had yesterday and learn more about how to confront the climate crisis.
The venerable Matt Wald at the “NY Times” had a revealing story yesterday: Fossil Fuels’ Hidden Cost Is in Billions, Study Says .
He cites a study , commissioned by Congress, just out from the National Research Council.
Monetizing the value of human life cut short by air pollution - “small soot particles, which cause lung damage; nitrogen oxides, which contribute to smog; and sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain” - the NRC estimated $120 billion a year in health costs, based on 20,000 premature deaths valued at $6 million each.
The study did not measure the impacts from trains, shipping, or aviation, nor from the impacts of climate change.
The NRC study neglects then, among other things, what James J. Corbett, a professor in the College of Earth, Ocean and Engineering at the University of Delaware, asserted in a study published two years ago that attributed 60,000 cardiopulmonary and lung cancer deaths each year globally to shipping emissions - and forecast an increase to nearly 85,000 deaths by 2012 under current trends.
The NRC study “…also found that renewable motor fuel, in the form of ethanol from corn, was slightly worse than gasoline in its environmental impact.” (See Are Biofuels A Bummer?
for more on the problems of ethanol production.
) The NRC study did not, however, delve into environmental or health damage from coal mining, oil extraction and refining, nor nuclear power operations and radioactive waste disposal.
(For more at the blog on coal, see Coal - Besides Carbon Dioxide, There’s … )
I finished reading the Hahn and Passell's background paper* on full speed ahead drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the Outer Continental Shelf.
It is hard to disagree with the conclusion that the benefits of full speed ahead drilling would likely outweigh the costs ... in a big way.
I especially liked the final paragraph:
His comments come in the wake of a bill in the U.S. House that would open the Outer Continental Shelf to oil drilling.
That bill, approved late Tuesday, was supported by nine of the state's 13 House members.
The basic model of natural resource economics is simple (and repetitive): higher prices create incentives for alternatives, exploration and new technologies.
That's why stripper well operators are so excited right now :
It's not much, but it is a simple illustration of the economics of a depletable natural resource.
Their carbon footprints -- the measure of carbon dioxide they contribute to global warming -- is much, much smaller.
The typical Ohio house uses an average of 31 kilowatt hours of electricity a day, according to estimates from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
Every day without power cuts an estimated 65 pounds of carbon dioxide produced by a coal-fired power plant.
Spread that across the nearly 2 million homes and businesses across Ohio that lost electricity Sunday, and the reduction in carbon-dioxide emissions was at least 124.3 million pounds.
A run on gasoline ahead of Hurricane Ike fueled long lines and rising prices today as Gov.
Easley warned against price gouging and others urged patience until the hurricane's effect on Gulf coast gas refineries can be assessed later this weekend.
Actually, tough OPEC quotas act like a tax where OPEC countries receive the revenue.
This is good for air quality and climate change mitigation but bad for the U.S. government budget outlook.
... the Environmental Economics blog ... is now the default homepage on my browser (but then again, I guess I am a wonk -- a word I learned on the E.E.
blog). That is a very nice service to the profession.
Scrapping fossil fuel subsidies is the idea here.
The caption is from today’s lead editorial in the “Financial Times.” Among its many felicitous effects, is the fact that “If effective in promoting efficient consumption, elimination would reduce the risk of runaway global warming.” The Third Assessment Report (2001) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recommended reducing subsidies in the energy sector and the IPCC Chair, Dr. Pachauri, has mentioned this often as a key mitigation tool.
President Obama has gone to Pittsburgh for the G20 meetings with this proposal in hand.
The AP, via “Newsday,” reported here that “Many countries, including the United States, provide tax breaks and direct payments to help produce and use oil, coal, natural gas and other fuels that spew carbon dioxide, the chief greenhouse gas.
Eliminating those would provide ‘a significant down payment’ toward the U.S. goal of cutting fossil fuel emissions in half by 2050, Froman said.” Mike Froman is the President’s national security adviser for economic affairs.
What do these subsidies look like in the US relative to those for renewables?
U.S. Fossil-Fuel Subsidies Twice That of Renewables is the answer from Bloomberg News.
“Government spending and tax breaks amounted to $72.5 billion for fossil fuels and $29 billion for renewable energy…” This story was based on a new report from the Environmental Law Institute.
Here is an excellent graphic depicting the disparity.
The OECD has just released a new book: “ The Economics of Climate Change Mitigation: Policies and Options for Global Action beyond 2012 .” To quote from the Executive Summary (pp.
5-6): “Closing the gap between domestic and international fossil fuel prices could cut GHG emissions drastically in the subsidising countries, in some cases by over 30% relative to BAU levels by 2050, and globally by 10%.” Further, “Energy subsidy removal would also raise GDP per capita in most of the countries concerned, including India and, to a lesser extent, China.”
In Indonesia, they’ve had some measured success in eliminating subsidies.
This “FT” article today describes the successes and the political pitfalls.
But, as Amory Lovins pointed out the other day in a brilliant talk I attended, “you can’t be afraid of the sound of breaking glass.” (More about Lovins anon.
) G20 leaders can’t be afraid either.
This could be a truly significant advance in curbing the threat of climate change.
Let’s hope they seize the moment.
I mentioned this new film on climate change this past Friday.
For more, see this review from my FPA sister blog, Global Film Review.
Sean Murphy is bringing a lot of insight to movies important to a better understanding of international affairs.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon organized a truly historic event today: the Summit on Climate Change .
President Obama was among the many speakers.
Carol Browner, Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change, and one of the critical voices within the Obama Administration for a robust and progressive approach to meeting the challenge of climate change, posted this entry today at the White House blog in which she said “Today we called on all nations to not simply seek an agreement to limit greenhouse gas emissions, but to seek an agreement that will allow all nations to grow and raise living standards without endangering our planet.”
The President, in his speech , noted that the world, including the US, had lagged on confronting the crisis.
“It is true that for too many years, mankind has been slow to respond or even recognize the magnitude of the climate threat.
It is true of my own country, as well.
We recognize that.” He went, though to say: “But this is a new day.
It is a new era.
And I am proud to say that the United States has done more to promote clean energy and reduce carbon pollution in the last eight months than at any other time in our history.”
The UN website has all of today’s speeches, with text and video, archived here , including those of President Obama; the SG; Dr. Pachauri, the IPCC Chair; Hu Jintao, the leader of the PRC; Yukio Hatoyama, the brand-new Japanese PM; and Nicolas Sarkozy, President of France.
There are several press conferences here as well, and the United Nations Leadership Forum on Climate Change , which brought together top international Governments, Business, and Civil Society leaders.
(See Sept. 22, 2009.
)
So while presidents, premiers and prime ministers were over at Ban Ki-moon’s Summit on Climate Change today saving the world, some pretty extraordinary innovators were elsewhere on Manhattan Island talking about green building .
I went to the Green Buildings Expo back in June and visited a lot of folks at their booths and talked with them about some of their fascinating work and products.
At the 2009 Urban Green Expo today, I did a little talking and listening at the exhibition booths, but also sat in on a couple of presentations.
One was on the Empire State Building .
This is heady stuff because not only are they going to retrofit this world landmark to reduce energy use by 38%, but they are also very much in the business of sharing the tools and knowledge applied here with other big commercial building owners who want to get at the same task.
The Clinton Climate Initiative is helping to foster the work of getting the word around.
In yet another in a seemingly endless series of gems of reporting on climate change, energy and sustainability, the “Financial Times” has this today.
The report looks at critical developments from sub-national governments from California to Sao Paulo to London and many points in between.
There are also interesting ads from TckTckTck and UNDP .
There’s a particularly hard-hitting guest column from Tim Wirth, a climate change stalwart for over two decades, and the head of the UN Foundation .
He says, for instance: “However, the fossil fuel barons, the lords of yesteryear, may yet succeed in the US Senate in blocking effective legislation this year.
They have wildly exaggerated the economic impact of a carbon cap and portrayed it as a new tax on the hard-pressed American consumer.
They encourage those who deny the scientific evidence of global warming, even as it reveals itself more clearly by the day.” Wirth is starkly honest in this.
Here’s a succinct and hopeful message from UNFCCC Executive Secretary Yvo de Boer on where we are on the international politics.
We will know more this week after the UN Climate Summit and the G20 meetings.
I’ve written about nuclear power here a number of times.
To be upfront with you: I’ve been an opponent for almost 40 years, since long before Chernobyl and Three Mile Island.
I have seen very little along the way to change my views.
In the light of the specter of climate change, I’ve tried to be open-minded.
However, there are still too many negatives.
In teaching my class on climate change this summer, I used an excellent paper from the Union of Concerned Scientists: Nuclear Power in a Warming World .
Among the concerns they flag - and they don’t close out the option by any means - are the safety of operations, defending against sabotage, nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism, and waste.
“What’s the best bet for the future?
An energy source with limited resource availability and major waste and security implications?
Or a range of new technologies based on natural energy flows, with no emissions, no wastes, no fuel resource limits, no fuel price rises, and no security implications, unless that is we start squabbling over the wind and solar resource around the planet?”
In Washington this week, the State Department is hosting meetings of the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate (MEF).
(See my posts related to the MEF.
) US Special Envoy for Climate Change Todd Stern is leading the US delegation.
The press release from State describes the meetings.
(More on the outcome tomorrow.
)
Next week, the UN Secretary General is hosting the Climate Summit in New York, a critical meeting of the world’s top leaders “…to mobilize the highest level political will needed to reach a fair, effective, and scientifically ambitious global climate deal…” in Copenhagen.
Reuters has this “ Factbox ” on the Summit.
See also this background paper on the Summit from the UN.
One big story line is that Hu Jintao “…will present China’s new plans for tackling global warming…” according to this , also from Reuters.
“Hu ‘will announce the next policies, measures and actions that China is going to take,’ added Xie, who steers China’s climate policy as vice director of the powerful National Development and Reform Commission.” John Kerry, who is the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chair, and who is spearheading the Democratic Party efforts in the Senate on climate change along with Environment and Public Works Committee Chair Barbara Boxer, underscores the importance of China’s role in this story from the Environmental News Network.
I mentioned Kerry’s articulate take on China at this post from July.
The UN is sponsoring Global Climate Week and the US Climate Action Network is promoting any number of important events durings its Climate Action Week .
They characterize the meetings in Washington, New York, and the G20 meetings in Pittsburgh later in the week as “A Test of Resolve for Obama and The Nation.”
“ The Age of Stupid ” will have its global premiere on Monday.
This pretty highly acclaimed movie is about “…a man living alone in the devastated world of 2055, looking at old footage from 2008 and asking: Why didn’t we stop climate change when we had the chance?” Good question.
Maybe we’ll get some good answers this week and next.
The venerable World Resources Institute has a terrific new source for data and information - EarthTrends .
I’ve been using some of their charts in my class on climate change at NYU.
Thomas Friedman says that China “…is led by a reasonably enlightened group of people.” This statement is, to be kind, scandalous.
China is a police state.
In Freedom House’s rating for 2009, China scored 6.5 with 7.0 being the least free.
China’s leaders have brutally repressed the populations of Tibet and East Turkestan for many decades.
They strongly support regimes in Zimbabwe, Sudan, Myanmar and North Korea that have consistently ravaged their own people.
China is itself corrupt.
Nearly unabated air and water pollution devastates the health of the Chinese people.
Friedman’s argument for the “enlightened” nature of the Chinese leadership hinges on its embrace of renewable energy technology.
I have no quibble whatsoever with the importance of this for both the Chinese people and our global struggle to avert a massive climate catastrophe.
It should be properly noted, however, that China continues to build scores of new coal-fired power plants annually, is in a headlong rush to put hundreds of thousands of new cars on its new roads, and, for my money, its push to nuclear power does not in the least indicate the requisite thoughtfulness and attention to environmental protection that would allow its leadership to be called enlightened.
The Climate Change Scoping Plan is the state’s roadmap to reach the greenhouse gas reduction goals required in the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, or AB 32.
This plan calls for an ambitious but achievable reduction in California’s carbon footprint – toward a clean energy future.
Reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels means cutting approximately 30% from business-as-usual emissions levels projected for 2020, or about 15% from today’s levels.
On a per-capita basis, that means reducing annual emissions of 14 tons of carbon dioxide for every man, woman and child in California down to about 10 tons per person by 2020.
This challenge also represents an opportunity to transform California’s economy into one that runs on clean and sustainable technologies, helping secure our energy independence and security, and ensure that all Californians are able to enjoy their rights to clean air, clean water, and a healthy and safe environment.
Cap-and-Trade Program: Broad-based to provide a firm limit on emissions; covers 85% of California’s emissions: electricity generation, large industrial sources, transportation fuels, and residential and commercial use of natural gas, and provides regional linkage with the Western Climate Initiative which allows greater environmental and economic benefits.
Air Resources Board.
Electricity and Energy (imported included): Improved appliance efficiency standards and other aggressive energy efficiency measures; 33% renewables by 2020; increased use of efficient “combined heat and power”; Million Solar Roofs, Solar Hot Water Heating; Green Buildings; and water efficiency.
Air Resources Board, State and Consumer Services Agency, California Energy Commission, California Public Utilities Commission, Department of Water Resources.
High Global Warming Potential Gases: Capture refrigerants and other high global warming potential gases already in use; reduce future impact through leak-resistant equipment, restrictions on use, and fees.
High global warming chemicals trap heat in the atmosphere at levels many times that of carbon dioxide, the primary cause of global warming.
Air Resources Board.
Agriculture: More efficient agricultural equipment, fuel use and water use through transportation and energy measures; reductions from manure digesters at dairies; address impacts on productivity of crops and livestock.
Air Resources Board, California Department of Food and Agriculture, State Water Resources Control Board.
Waste and Recycling: Reduce methane emissions from landfills and move toward high recycling and zero waste.

The Scoping Plan continues California’s legacy of efficiency-driven job growth.
Achieving the greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets mandated by AB 32 supports a $76 billion increase in our Gross State Product (GSP), $48 billion increase in real household incomes, and the creation of 403,000 new efficiency- and climate-driven jobs.

California’s real estate assets are at risk.
$2.5 trillion in real estate assets in California are at risk from extreme weather events, sea level rise, and wildfires, with a projected annual price tag of $300 million to $3.9 billion over this century, depending on how warm the world gets.

If no action is taken there will be losses throughout California’s economy.
In the face of rising temperatures, six economic sectors -- water, energy, transportation, tourism and recreation, agriculture, and public health-- would together incur tens of billions per year in direct costs, even higher indirect costs, and expose trillions of dollars of assets to collateral risk.

Scarce water supplies could cost millions annually.
Water supply costs due to scarcity and increased operating costs would increase as much as $689 million per year by 2050.
Researchers found that changes in yields (mostly negative) and changes in water availability could result in gross revenue losses of up to $3 billion by 2050.

Costly wildfires will continue to increase.
Scientists estimate that wildfire risk will increase throughout the end of the century.

The plan relies on a strong network of climate partnerships – so California is not going it alone.
Local government will play an essential role in fighting climate change.
More than 100 California cities and counties have signed the U.S. Conference of Mayors Climate Protection Agreement.
Many have established offices of climate change and are developing and implementing comprehensive plans to reduce their carbon footprint.

Many are participating in voluntary programs.
Nearly 350 companies, municipalities, organizations and corporations are members of the California Climate Action Registry, reporting their greenhouse gas emissions on an annual basis.
Californians have also been on the leading edge of purchasing offsets to mitigate their own personal emissions.
The state intends to ensure our citizens that they can be assured of the credibility of these offsets.

The Stern report last week predicted dire economic and social effects of unchecked global warming.
In what many will see as a highly controversial polemic, Christopher Monckton disputes the 'facts' of this impending apocalypse and accuses the UN and its scientists of distorting the truth
Last week, Gordon Brown and his chief economist both said global warming was the worst "market failure" ever.
That loaded soundbite suggests that the "climate-change" scare is less about saving the planet than, in Jacques Chirac's chilling phrase, "creating world government".
This week and next, I'll reveal how politicians, scientists and bureaucrats contrived a threat of Biblical floods, droughts, plagues, and extinctions worthier of St John the Divine than of science.
Sir Nicholas Stern's report on the economics of climate change, which was published last week, says that the debate is over.
It isn't.
There are more greenhouse gases in the air than there were, so the world should warm a bit, but that's as far as the "consensus" goes.
After the recent hysteria, you may not find the truth easy to believe.
So you can find all my references and detailed calculations here .
In 1988, James Hansen, a climatologist, told the US Congress that temperature would rise 0.3C by the end of the century (it rose 0.1C), and that sea level would rise several feet (no, one inch).
The UN set up a transnational bureaucracy, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
The UK taxpayer unwittingly meets the entire cost of its scientific team, which, in 2001, produced the Third Assessment Report, a Bible-length document presenting apocalyptic conclusions well beyond previous reports.
This week, I'll show how the UN undervalued the sun's effects on historical and contemporary climate, slashed the natural greenhouse effect, overstated the past century's temperature increase, repealed a fundamental law of physics and tripled the man-made greenhouse effect.
Next week, I'll demonstrate the atrocious economic, political and environmental cost of the high-tax, zero-freedom, bureaucratic centralism implicit in Stern's report; I'll compare the global-warming scare with previous sci-fi alarums; and I'll show how the environmentalists' "precautionary principle" (get the state to interfere now, just in case) is killing people.
So to the scare.
First, the UN implies that carbon dioxide ended the last four ice ages.
It displays two 450,000-year graphs: a sawtooth curve of temperature and a sawtooth of airborne CO2 that's scaled to look similar.
Usually, similar curves are superimposed for comparison.
The UN didn't do that.
If it had, the truth would have shown: the changes in temperature preceded the changes in CO2 levels.
Next, the UN abolished the medieval warm period (the global warming at the end of the First Millennium AD).
In 1995, David Deming, a geoscientist at the University of Oklahoma, had written an article reconstructing 150 years of North American temperatures from borehole data.
He later wrote: "With the publication of the article in Science, I gained significant credibility in the community of scientists working on climate change.
They thought I was one of them, someone who would pervert science in the service of social and political causes.
One of them let his guard down.
A major person working in the area of climate change and global warming sent me an astonishing email that said: 'We have to get rid of the Medieval Warm Period.
' "
So they did.
The UN's second assessment report, in 1996, showed a 1,000-year graph demonstrating that temperature in the Middle Ages was warmer than today.
But the 2001 report contained a new graph showing no medieval warm period.
It wrongly concluded that the 20th century was the warmest for 1,000 years.
The graph looked like an ice hockey-stick.
The wrongly flat AD1000-AD1900 temperature line was the shaft: the uptick from 1900 to 2000 was the blade.
Here's how they did it:
• The technique they overweighted was one which the UN's 1996 report had said was unsafe: measurement of tree-rings from bristlecone pines.
Tree-rings are wider in warmer years, but pine-rings are also wider when there's more carbon dioxide in the air: it's plant food.
This carbon dioxide fertilisation distorts the calculations.
The UN, echoed by Stern, says the graph isn't important.
It is.
Scores of scientific papers show that the medieval warm period was real, global and up to 3C warmer than now.
Then, there were no glaciers in the tropical Andes: today they're there.
There were Viking farms in Greenland: now they're under permafrost.
There was little ice at the North Pole: a Chinese naval squadron sailed right round the Arctic in 1421 and found none.
The Antarctic, which holds 90 per cent of the world's ice and nearly all its 160,000 glaciers, has cooled and gained ice-mass in the past 30 years, reversing a 6,000-year melting trend.
Data from 6,000 boreholes worldwide show global temperatures were higher in the Middle Ages than now.
And the snows of Kilimanjaro are vanishing not because summit temperature is rising (it isn't) but because post-colonial deforestation has dried the air.
Al Gore please note.
• Every "forcing" produces "climate feedbacks" making temperature rise faster.
For instance, as temperature rises in response to a forcing, the air carries more water vapour, the most important greenhouse gas; and polar ice melts, increasing heat absorption.
Up goes the temperature again.
The UN more than doubled the base forcings from greenhouse gases to allow for climate feedbacks.
It didn't do the same for the base solar forcing.
Two centuries ago, the astronomer William Herschel was reading Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations when he noticed that quoted grain prices fell when the number of sunspots rose.
Gales of laughter ensued, but he was right.
At solar maxima, when the sun was at its hottest and sunspots showed, temperature was warmer, grain grew faster and prices fell.
Such observations show that even small solar changes affect climate detectably.
But recent solar changes have been big.
Sami Solanki, a solar physicist, says that in the past half-century the sun has been warmer, for longer, than at any time in at least the past 11,400 years, contributing a base forcing equivalent to a quarter of the past century's warming.
That's before adding climate feedbacks.
The UN expresses its heat-energy forcings in watts per square metre per second.
It estimates that the sun caused just 0.3 watts of forcing since 1750.
Begin in 1900 to match the temperature start-date, and the base solar forcing more than doubles to 0.7 watts.
Multiply by 2.7, which the Royal Society suggests is the UN's current factor for climate feedbacks, and you get 1.9 watts – more than six times the UN's figure.
Next, the UN slashed the natural greenhouse effect by 40 per cent from 33C in the climate-physics textbooks to 20C, making the man-made additions appear bigger.
Then the UN chose the biggest 20th-century temperature increase it could find.
Stern says: "As anticipated by scientists, global mean surface temperatures have risen over the past century.
" As anticipated?
Only 30 years ago, scientists were anticipating a new Ice Age and writing books called The Cooling.
In the US, where weather records have been more reliable than elsewhere, 20th-century temperature went up by only 0.3C.
AccuWeather, a worldwide meteorological service, reckons world temperature rose by 0.45C.
The US National Climate Data Centre says 0.5C.
Any advance on 0.5?
The UN went for 0.6C, probably distorted by urban growth near many of the world's fast-disappearing temperature stations.
Even a 0.6C temperature rise wasn't enough.
So the UN repealed a fundamental physical law.
Buried in a sub-chapter in its 2001 report is a short but revealing section discussing "lambda": the crucial factor converting forcings to temperature.
The UN said its climate models had found lambda near-invariant at 0.5C per watt of forcing.
You don't need computer models to "find" lambda.
Its value is given by a century-old law, derived experimentally by a Slovenian professor and proved by his Austrian student (who later committed suicide when his scientific compatriots refused to believe in atoms).
The Stefan-Boltzmann law, not mentioned once in the UN's 2001 report, is as central to the thermodynamics of climate as Einstein's later equation is to astrophysics.
Like Einstein's, it relates energy to the square of the speed of light, but by reference to temperature rather than mass.
Deep-ocean temperature hasn't changed at all, it's barely above freezing.
The models tend to over-predict the warming of the climate-relevant surface layer up to threefold.
A recent paper by John Lyman, of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, reports that the oceans have cooled sharply in the past two years.
The computers didn't predict this.
Sea level is scarcely rising faster today than a century ago: an inch every 15 years.
Hansen now says that the oceanic "flywheel effect" gives us extra time to act, so Stern's alarmism is misplaced.
Finally, the UN's predictions are founded not only on an exaggerated forcing-to-temperature conversion factor justified neither by observation nor by physical law, but also on an excessive rate of increase in airborne carbon dioxide.
The true rate is 0.38 per cent year on year since records began in 1958.
The models assume 1 per cent per annum, more than two and a half times too high.
In 2001, the UN used these and other adjustments to predict a 21st-century temperature increase of 1.5 to 6C.
Stern suggests up to 10C.
The powerful killer tornados that blasted across the Southeast on Tuesday were - according to Dr. Jeff Masters , the most deadly mid-winter tornados in recorded history with the exception of a storm in January, 1949.
The drought that continues to plague northern Georgia, Alabama and the Carolinas is equally unusual in that region's history.
Scientists and responsible science writers (such as Chris Mooney ) are admitting that in both cases - and in general - they must be very cautious about attributing these oddball extremes to climate change.
Fair enough.
That's how science should and must be.
But really, does it matter?
If we are witnessing hundreds of broken records for temperature, rainfall and drought in the course of a year, there's a gut level instinct that tells you something is changing in the world.
No one has yet defined how we'll mark the official, scientifically sanctioned and approved beginning of Climate Change.
No one has described how we will someday look back on history and set a pushpin on a timeline and declare, "This is when the climate began to change.
"
We certainly can't say that just because over 50 people were killed in February tornados this year, we can expect to see such patterns repeated from now on.
The most certain thing we can say about climate change is that its behavior will be uncertain.
Our weather patterns may change, but they may not settle into any patterns at all.
I think it's fair to say that having the Arctic ice cover disappear, having countless glaciers retreat, having severe flooding in England, catastrophic drought in Australia and shrinking snowpack in the Rockies all represent changes in...something.
We can studiously avoid blaming these facts on global warming, but not if it means denying that they are happening.

'Planning in a Changing Climate' is the final project strategy of PART I that aims to influence the philosophy and practice of spatial planning by recommending how adaptation to climate change can be incorporated.
Why adaptation to climate change must be addressed in spatial planning
We now know that man-made climate change has been underway since the mid-20th century and is having significant effects around the world.
IPCC - Climate Change 2007.
Mitigation measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are essential if we are to avoid the worst effects of climate change.
Yet, however successful we are at reducing emissions, we will have to deal with many decades of climate change, due to emissions that we have already put into the climate system.
We need to start adapting today to these changing conditions, to ensure our social, economic and environmental systems are best-prepared for the unavoidable impacts and are able to take advantage of any opportunities.
Spatial planning mediates between competing demands on the way land is managed and used.
While some uncertainty remains over the exact impacts of climate change, it has the potential to be so significant that it will challenge our basic assumptions on the availability of land and its uses over the medium and long term.
The Stern Review on the economics of climate change highlighted the crucial role of spatial planning in facilitating climate adaptation and emphasised that adaptation should be integrated into planning at every level.
With climate change underway and future change unavoidable, all professional advice and political decisions must now take climate change into account.
Recognising the vital role of spatial planning in enabling society to adapt to climate change, the ESPACE project aims to change the philosophy and practice of spatial planning.
This inability to comprehend is, most disappointingly, shared with the people who are responsible for planning the spacial and physical changes to the infrastructure and facilities we depend on as residents of our local areas.
Sea level rise is an apt climate change impact to use because the preponderance of projections for how fast it will rise make it seem like not much of a threat.
When most planners accept a pace of a foot of rise over the next 40 years, there's not much urgency there.
A few sea walls, some levees, some pumps...no problemo.
But such estimates ignore the low percentage risks that the sea level might rise much faster than that.
The two authors, Jonathan Barnett and Kristina Hill, have studied the actions of local planners and have concluded that for the most part, climate change has not yet shown up on their radars.
As far as we can tell, most designers and planners aren’t thinking seriously about climate change in the U.S. unless they work closely with the insurance industry, which is dropping tens of thousands of East Coast customers and raising rates on the rest, in part as a result of climate predictions.
Ecologists all over the world also know that it’s a very big deal.
The World Bank knows.
But building and landscape architects, engineers, and planners don’t seem to have connected the dots.
Jonathan, the other author of this article, worked on the first reconstruction plan for New Orleans after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and saw the devastation from a storm surge that could have been prevented if the flood walls had been properly constructed.
He became frustrated with the many comments from people outside New Orleans that the city had simply been built in the wrong location and ought to be a write-off, and he began to wonder what would happen if we applied the same standard to other places.
Biloxi and other Gulf Coast cities also suffered severe damage from Katrina and Rita.
Key West had flooding comparable to that in New Orleans from Rita.
If we looked around the country at other vulnerable cities, we’d have to write off many more than New Orleans.
By working with large insurance companies, government regulators could encourage rationality when either the private sector or public agencies make major investments in coastal urban futures.
Important dialogues could begin about how to share the significant investment costs of adapting coastal areas to sea-level rise and new flooding patterns.
Because they would bring insurers and institutional leaders together, these new investment and cost-sharing discussions provide a way to allow flexible design and planning solutions to emerge that would be insurable, politically feasible, and recognize the need for social equity in how citizens are protected from immediate and longer-term dangers.
At the same time, it's been noted by climate scientists that the unknowns in the science will be tilted toward negative effects, as we can see here (and this shift has *huge* implications, BTW):
“Widening of the tropical belt in a changing climate”
Abstract: “Some of the earliest unequivocal signs of climate change have been the warming of the air and ocean, thawing of land and melting of ice in the Arctic.
But recent studies are showing that the tropics are also changing.
Several lines of evidence show that over the past few decades the tropical belt has expanded.
This expansion has potentially important implications for subtropical societies and may lead to profound changes in the global climate system.
Most importantly, poleward movement of large-scale atmospheric circulation systems, such as jet streams and storm tracks, could result in shifts in precipitation patterns affecting natural ecosystems, agriculture, and water resources.
The implications of the expansion for stratospheric circulation and the distribution of ozone in the atmosphere are as yet poorly understood.
The observed recent rate of expansion is greater than climate model projections of expansion over the twenty-first century, which suggests that there is still much to be learned about this aspect of global climate change.”
I remember how disoriented much of the Bay Area was after the Loma Prieta earthquake.
Of course, we all live here - among these faults - by choice.
But after the earth has shaken so hard, it challenges your core assumption that the earth is SOLID.

If you live in the drought-affected areas of northern Georgia and Alabama, your employment fortunes might be in the dumpster or they may be soaring.
Clearly, you'd better be a creative landscaper or nursery owner to be getting any business these days, but as this AP story tells us, well-drillers and water recyclers are unable to keep up with the booming demand, even when an average new well will cost $6500 to drill with no guarantee that water will be found.
"The drought's got people thinking about water more," said Charles Cone of Southern Energy Solutions in Marietta.
"I think there's going to be a gradual shift toward this sort of thing.
"
The RainHarvest Company, a suburban Atlanta business that outfits homes with systems that capture and reuse rain, said business has quadrupled since the drought began.
He installs large underground tanks that capture and store falling rain water.
The water can be pumped back into the home and reused in the shower, dishwasher and irrigation system, or it can be purified and used as drinking water.
64 percent thought global warming was the most important factor to consider when developing transportation and land-use plans.
Another 28 percent considered it at least somewhat important.
Looking out my home office window, Mt.
Tamalpais can be seen through the haze of smoke that has drifted north from San Diego.
Appropriately, the San Francisco Chronicle published a story today about how the homes on the slopes of Mt.
Tam are one of the most at-risk homes in the Bay Area.
We've had a few days of heavy rain and it's tempting to think that the fire season is over for us.
We haven't had anywhere near the heat and extended drought of San Diego.
Yet a fire department engineer stationed on the slopes of the mountain told the reporter, "We regularly take the fuel moisture reading here, and the fuel load right now is at 64 percent.
Sixty-six percent is what we consider critical, so I'd say we have to be pretty careful right now.

Yeah, Southern California is a natural desert area and yes, it gets especially dry every year in early fall.
And yes, the Santa Ana winds blow every year creating a heightened risk of fast-moving fire.
But this year the conditions were different.
It had been hotter and drier through this past summer.
The winds blew harder.
And housing development further into the brush was just tempting disaster.
The 16 wind-blown fires that forced the largest mass evacuation in California history may or may not be the result of climate change, but studies have shown that the hot drought conditions that fed the flames are becoming more common.
The flames stretching from Malibu to the Mexican border struck during the driest year in Southern California history.
Measurements taken by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection detected less than 10 percent moisture in the region's vegetation.
The moisture level in kiln-dried lumber is generally 12 percent.
Chronically drier than normal conditions promotes the growth of invasive plant and insect species that may add to flammable material.
We all know about the bark beatles that are killing off conifers and leaving forests of firewood.
And sources of ignition - specifically lightning - are predicted to increase with the increase of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere.
Other experts quoted in the Chronicle article pointed out that the Santa Ana winds had sustained longer than usual in fanning the San Diego flames.
And though none could say for sure that the fire was a result of climate change, it was undeniable that the smoke from the fires is contributing to global warming.
One link that can be made, according to Tom Bonnicksen, a California forest and wildfire expert, is how the fires are contributing to global warming.
Almost 20 million tons of greenhouse gases - the equivalent of what is emitted in one year by 3.6 million cars - have been spewed into the atmosphere, he said.
"The problem isn't global warming causing fires," he said.
"The real problem is these fires contributing to the greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming.
"
The response to the worst drought on record in the Southeast has unfolded in ultra-slow motion.
All summer, more than a year after the drought began, fountains blithely sprayed, football fields were watered, prisoners got two showers a day and Coca-Cola’s bottling plants chugged along at full strength.
In early October, on an 81-degree day, an outdoor theme park began to manufacture what was intended to be a 1.2-million gallon mountain of snow.
And Georgia is not at the back of the pack; Alabama, where severe drought is more widespread, has not passed legislation calling for a management plan.
A realistic statewide plan, experts say, would tell developers that they cannot build if no water is available, and might have restricted some of the enormous growth in the Atlanta area over the last decade.
Already, officials have little notion how to provide for a projected doubling of demand over the next 30 years.
The ideas that have been floated, including piping water from Tennessee or desalinating ocean water, will require hundreds of billions of dollars and painful decisions the state has been loathe to undertake.
This week's New York Times Magazine has a long article on the drought in the Southwest by Jon Gertner.
I've blogged about this situation here and here , but you've got to read all of this article to come to grips with how water shortage may be the climate change impact that takes a greater toll on humanity than a slow rise in the sea level.
Just considering the Colorado River - one of many rivers in the world that is depended on by people living in otherwise arid climates:
Bradley Udall, whose testimony before Congress was described in the article, took the author to visit some of the reservoirs in Colorado that are being impacted by the drought in the Southwest.
He was, in essence, trying to illustrate the need for all of the dependents on the dwindling water supply to begin adapting to the current and future reality.
As he put it, he wants to connect the disparate members of the water economy in a way that has never really been done before, so that utility executives, scientists, environmentalists, business leaders, farmers and politicians can begin discussing how to cope with the inevitable shortages of fresh water.
The water manager for Aurora, Colorado described his town's efforts to find water sources where there are none.
Drilling wells next to a nearby river, sucking the river water out through the "filter" of its shoreline, using the water and then releasing treated wastewater back into the river, upstream from their wells allows them to re-use the same water repeatedly...for a while.
It's still going to be one of the most expensive municipal water systems in the US, but it may be the method used by other cities in the Southwest to replace the shrinking snowmelt water sources.
It may even be adopted by towns in the drying Southeast, like Athens.
But if the current drought is, indeed, the leading edge of climate change and not just a periodic climatic variation, then such measures are just stop-gap.
One scientist quoted in the article - Richard Seager - put it this way in a Q&A with the author:
“You know, it’s like, O.K., there’s trouble in the future, but how near in the future does it set in?” he told me.
“In this case, it appears that it’s happening right now.” When I asked if the drought in his models would be permanent, he pondered the question for a moment, then replied: “You can’t call it a drought anymore, because it’s going over to a drier climate.
No one says the Sahara is in drought.”
This is how they're approaching the megadrought in southern Australia, where it's become known as the Big Dry.
Another climatologist, Roger Pulwarty - who has long studied adaptation to dry climates - is worried about this present stretch of drought.
The article also includes extensive interviewing with the water manager of Las Vegas, who is endowed with enough money to offer to build large desalination plants on the Pacific coastline to supply California with water in exchange for getting some of Cali's share of the Colorado River water.
(Desalination requires lots of energy and produces lots of brine.
) Las Vegas continues to grow, and to use water lavishly as a desert city.
Perhaps its collapse will come as a result of rising fuel (and airplane ticket) costs before it comes from lack of water.
To Peter Gleick, head of the Pacific Institute, a nonprofit based in Oakland, Calif., that focuses on global water issues, whether we can adapt to a drier future depends on whether we can rethink the functions, and value, of fresh water.
Can we can do the same things using less of it?
How we use our water, Gleick believes, is considerably more complex than it appears.
It's not like Athens, Georgia's government didn't prepare for a drought.
In fact, most responsible local resource districts have contingency plans in place for what they define as a drought - which is an extended period with no rain that most likely won't happen again the next year.
In a column responding to public criticism , the manager of the local unified district described what looks like a competent plan, which is still being "methodically implemented.
" Yet, the actual drought has gone beyond what had been thought of as a "100-year" event.
The column explains that in 1996, a reservoir was planned and subsequently built as a 90-day backup water supply.
A Comprehensive Drought Management Plan was developed by the government, in concert with local businesses in 2000 and updated in 2004.
In response to that plan, measures were put into action to reduce water usage by 10%, and then by 20% - with public response hitting those goals in both instances.
None of these decisions were easy.
As the governing authority, the mayor and commission were called upon to make difficult community-value decisions to provide for critical community needs.
They have held to those decisions despite unwarranted criticism from some sectors of the community.
They might be called upon to make even more difficult decisions if the drought continues and a 30 percent or greater sustainable reduction in water use is needed.
Athens may have been the best prepared community in the drought area, but without rainfall that preparedness may only have bought them a bit more time than their neighbors before the impact lands on livelihoods.
I went this year because, as I changed my focus to climate change, my wife, Nancy, thought it would be a good for me to mix it up with more "environmental types.
" Little did I know.
No, I did not learn much about how we will adapt materially to changing climate.
And no, I didn't make connections with people who might fund my work - at least not to my knowledge.
But the 3-day experience was invaluable for the inspiration it brought, and the optimism it bred.
One of the greatest obstacles to adapting to any new environment is the attachment to the old environment.
And in American consumer culture, much of that old environment is composed of the conveniences of the modern life that depend on the factors that are causing our climate to change.
Look at our dependence on the petroleum-burning engine and the stubbornness with which so many of us cling to the freedom to drive gas guzzlers.
Adapting to $10/gallon gasoline is going to be difficult and painful for most Americans.
I learned that in Climate Frog's presentation of future scenarios, where radical climate change is likely to force social transformation in countless localities, it will be much more effective to foster trust and mutual caring than to foment conflict by jamming change down people's throats.
Taking the long view and planning well in advance, communities can come to agreements for mutual benefit and make sure that all residents are included in the decision making.
Adaptation must be an inclusive process.
Communities must learn from the experiences of other communities already dealing with impacts of climate change.
Driving home from the conference my strong sense was that the PV market right now is where home computers were in the late 1970's and cell phones were in the late 1990's.
It's both gratifying to be a pioneer in this industry having sold the first PV module in America back in 1978 and daunting to see the tidal wave of the solar economy washing up on our shores so quickly.
In the long run it's just what we need if we're to have a chance to mitigate global warming.
The American Southeast has been baking and shriveling through drought conditions not seen for at least a century.
With much larger populations and more land devoted to agriculture and timber, the demands on water supplies have grown proportionately.
Now northern Georgia is facing what may someday be regarded as "classic drought adaptation.
" What Georgians do over the next year may provide a model of how to (or how not to) change habits, choices and perhaps a regional economy to deal with a radically different definition of "normal.
"
Typical of our culture of denial, many people are now asking how things could have gotten so bad with no warning or efforts to prepare for it.
The Georgia state climatologist called drought "the Rodney Dangerfield of natural disasters.
" It doesn't get the respect and attention of hurricanes and floods until it reaches extreme conditions where radical conservation measures are demanded.
Meanwhile, the University of Georgia has created a Drought Website to report on emergency conservation measures, the status of agriculture and condition like the rising number of mosquitos and the accompanying threat of West Nile disease.
Leave it to a guy who teaches science, probably to high schoolers, to clarify the risk assessment process for taking action on global warming, or as he posits the threat, "climate destabilization.
" If you've been reading my blog for while, you'll have noticed that I've tried to frame climate adaptation in much the same way, but this guy nails it.
Achieving and maintaining sustainability requires keeping up with science.
At times, land use and other public policy decisions operate within an institutional framework that does not reflect current scientific information.
This is understandable as cutting edge science is always on the move.
For example, the multiple causes and effects of climate change, described below, are now well established and current land use decision-making needs to reflect the link between fossil fuel consumption and sea level rise.
Keeping up with science is an underlying principle of this Plan.
Towards that end, employing evidencebased strategies combined with up-to-date scientific knowledge will provide sound guidelines for taking care of the land, our communities, and the generations that will follow us.
Many structures lie in hazardous areas, and land for new development may be even more hazardprone.
With most easily buildable land already developed, construction increasingly is being proposed on the remaining marginal lots with difficult access and steep hillsides which are subject to slope instability and are vulnerable to rapid changes in fire behavior.
Bluff erosion is threatening coastal homes built when bluff edges seemed safely distant.
Vegetation that can fuel fires has increased because
natural fires have been suppressed, and residential development continues to encroach on wildlands.
Proliferation of impermeable surfaces, alteration of natural drainage patterns, and the effects of climate change have increased the frequency and severity of flood events, and estimates indicate that sea level could rise as much as 36 inches by 2100.
Maps 2-9 through 2-15 are utilized by the County in reviewing land use activities proposed in areas with hazard potential.
With increases in sea level due to global warming, flooding is predicted to increase in the future.
Locating development in flood-prone areas can expose structures to damage and create risks for inhabitants in the immediate and surrounding areas.
EH-3.k Anticipate Sea Level Rise.
Work with the U.S. Geological Survey, the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission, and other monitoring agencies to track bay and ocean levels; utilize estimates for mean sea level rise to map potential areas subject to future inundation (including by updating information about watershed channel conditions and levee elevations); and amend the Development Code to incorporate construction standards consistent with the policies of BCDS’s Bay Plan for any areas subject to increased flooding from a rise in sea level.
EH-3.l Limit Seawall Barriers.
Limit repair, replacement, or construction of coastal sea walls and erosion barriers consistent with Local Coastal Program requirements, and as demonstrated to be necessary to protect persons and properties from rising sea level.
This may sound radical today, when practically every community is reliant on food, goods, water, fuel and power brought in from long distances, but the onset of climate change puts these dependencies on a razor's edge.
Extreme weather, rising seas and skyrocketing oil prices are likely to isolate your city, your town, your community and make all of the above abs0lutely necessary.
will "power down," which is learning to live with less power, and generating power on a hyperlocal level.
This adaptation is what Hopkins calls "resilience" - the ability to withstand the shocks that will come with climate change and unaffordable oil.
Inland flooding is a natural process in most areas of the world, but human settlement and construction along with attempts to out-engineer Nature have complicated the situation.
This article was written about a location in India , but refers to the recent flooding experiences in England, France and Belgium as examples of the consequences of building along river banks.
Flood control requires an integrated understanding of hydrology and ecology of the Valvonti river basin.
Controlling such floods in future needs joint monitoring and management of Valvonti’s inter-state catchments.
There are natural and man-made reasons for the recent flash floods.
Natural reasons may include higher rainfall intensity, bottlenecks in the silted streams feeding the tributaries and truncation of the normal flow channels.
Man-made reasons could be several but the systematic destruction of the steep slopes of the Virdi hills by plantation owners in the catchment area of Valvonti is a major cause.
The floods might have lasted for a few hours but the intensity and consequent damages were far greater this time than in the past.
In Keri, Sattari such flash floods were experienced for the first time in 60 years, so the people were caught by surprise, especially as they took place in the night.
The government thinks that longer, taller and stronger RCC embankments will control the floods.
But these are of limited use if the flood water carries a heavy sediment load and acquires a higher momentum downstream.
Embankments which fragment the natural flood plain could actually cause more havoc in the downstream areas.
Hurricane Andrew, with $15 billion in insured losses -- threw Florida's property insurance market into chaos, many carriers discovered they had miscalculated their exposure to large weather-related losses.
Many homeowners faced higher rates and fewer options for coverage.
Insurers tried to spread their risk over larger areas with less hurricane exposure.
Pearce describes “A severe imbalance between the need for insurance and the industry's capacity to provide it.”
But Andrew did not slow the settling of Hurricane Alley and no laws were passed to limit such exposure.
After all, Florida’s coastline is its main attraction for new residents and the travel industry.
So now insurance is provided as a shared risk between insurance companies, the state and the homeowner.
This is not, however, a comprehensive answer to the risk of storm damage and destruction.
Another Andrew – given the continued build-up along the coast – could still bankrupt all of the provisional insurance sources.
For everyone whose home is at risk now or may be in the future due to the impacts of climate change, following the thinking of insurance providers is key for several reasons:
People pay insurers so that they can recover or rebuild lost property due to catastrophe.
Policy holders trust that they’re covered in case Nature clobbers their homes with wind, fire, flood or earthquake.
Insurers, though, are constantly re-evaluating the risks associated with that coverage.
There is impeccable logic to the argument that taxpayers should not be made to pay for the risks incurred by people who choose to live along a hurricane-prone coast or atop a major geological fault.
It then noted that 50 percent of Americans live within 50 miles of a coast, and thus are vulnerable directly or indirectly to the damage of hurricanes and sea level rise.
At some point, as climate change advances and shows itself, many of those residents may no longer be able to buy or afford insurance.
Since Hurricane Katrina — which caused a record $50 billion in insured losses — private insurers have jacked up premiums as much as they can and, when barred from raising prices, dropped coverage of riskier homes.
Collecting reports of local climate change impacts and responses from around the world, I'm accumulating a database that can be used for strategic planning by other localities as lessons learned, best practices and valuable contacts.
It's the oldest and most cliched of metaphors, but when it comes to global warming, it's the only one that really works: We're in a desperate race.
Politics is chasing reality, and the gap between them isn't closing nearly fast enough.
What to do AFTER the flooding has caught you unprepared.
Flood damage in Wales costs an average of £70m a year and spending on defences has doubled in the last eight years.
This may involve some areas being flooded in order to protect other communities.
Environment Minister Jane Davidson has ordered a fresh look at policy in the wake of flooding this summer.
She has ordered a three-year programme to refresh flooding policy, with the aim of developing a new strategy which involves "working with nature, rather than against it".
"The trigger for it was having the latest evidence which suggests that within the next 100 years sea levels will rise by 1 metre and there will be a 20% increase in flooding risk," she tells BBC Wales' Eye on Wales programme.
She said that one solution would be to look to countries like Malaysia as an example and use playing fields as storage ponds in the event of flooding.
"When we see over the last few years that we're already seeing small increases in flooding risk - every single one of those is a devastation for the community and individual involved," she added.
"So what we have to do is use the land to our advantage.
And it might mean sometimes that we have to allow some areas to flood in order to ensure that bigger communities further down a river don't flood.
"
The Brownsville Municipal Authority is trying to figure out why there is flooding in an area that's never had flooding before during heavy rain.
Engineer Bill Johnson said it hasn't happened during every storm, but on several occasions since the new sewer lines were installed, there has been flooding on Water Street between 12th and 16th streets.
Johnson said the problem started about a month ago, so it is being caused by something that has occurred since the installation, not because of the installation.
"The flooding is weather-related.
We need to find where it's coming from," Johnson said.
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority unveiled plans yesterday for significant and costly changes to subway stations to prevent the shutdown of service that followed last month’s intense flooding.
In Spike Lee's heartbreaking retrospective of Hurricane Katrina, When the Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Acts , we hear the angry laments of survivors who were denied insurance benefits for damage because - their carriers claimed - water damage was not covered in their policies.
Katrina was an exceptional event in the universe of risk management that is the domain of insurance companies, and when it comes to compensation, the insurance company is the final interpreter of its own policy language.
For an event as huge as Katrina, a policy for protection from hurricane damage may be interpreted as specific to the effects of high wind, excluding the accompanying storm surge or torrential rains.
Insurance adjusters on the ground are given their marching orders and scripts, while policy holders are left standing dumfounded and incredulous to deal with the total losses of their homes and property.
Ten years ago, Peter Levene, chairman of Lloyds of London, was skeptical about global warming theories, but no longer.
He believes carbon emissions caused by human activity are warming the Earth and causing severe weather-related events.
"At Lloyds, we feel the effects of extreme weather more than most," he said in a March speech.
"We don't just live with risk -- we have to pick up the pieces afterwards.
" Lloyds predicts that the United States will be hit by a hurricane causing $100 billion worth of damage, more than double that of Katrina.
Industry analysts estimate that such an event would bankrupt as many as 40 insurers.
Lloyd's has warned: "The insurance industry must start actively adjusting in response to greenhouse gas trends if it is to survive.
" The Association of British Insurers has called on governments to "stem ominous weather related trends" by cutting carbon emissions.
U.S.-based companies AIG and Marsh -- respectively, the largest insurer and broker -- have joined with other corporate leaders to urge Congress to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions 60 to 80 percent by mid-century.
AIG's policy statement on climate change "recognizes the scientific consensus that climate change is a reality and is likely in large part the result of human activities that have led to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the earth's atmosphere.
"
Good for them, but meanwhile for all localities with vulnerability to climate change impacts, this stands as a major issue, for as risks rise for damage or destruction from storms, floods, wildfires, drought and sea level rise, we know that insurance companies are making their adjustments in advance.
They are taking their place - consistent with their profit-oriented mission - in the vanguard of climate change risk management.
If climate change looms as a serious threat in Marin's future, even more immediate is the dramatic demographic shift that will happen as we Boomers reach our senior years.
Unless more senior housing is provided, many of us will be forced to relocate to other areas within the next 20 years.
The over-65 demographic is by far the fastest growing one in Marin, and there has been a strong movement to reclaim the St. Vincent property from the Bayfront Corridor zoning.
More scientists have just come out and told it like it is.
The AP story by Seth Borenstein is less about what its title says - Rising Seas Likely to Flood U.S. History - and more about the certainty of two dozen climatologists that the sea level will rise by at least 3 feet no matter what we do to slow global warming.
Global warming — through a combination of melting glaciers, disappearing ice sheets and warmer waters expanding — is expected to cause oceans to rise by one meter, or about 39 inches.
It will happen regardless of any future actions to curb greenhouse gases, several leading scientists say.
And it will reshape the nation.
Sea level rise is "the thing that I'm most concerned about as a scientist," says Benjamin Santer, a climate physicist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California.
"We're going to get a meter and there's nothing we can do about it," said University of Victoria climatologist Andrew Weaver, a lead author of the February report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in Paris.
"It's going to happen no matter what — the question is when.
"
Potential CC-caused sea level rise will probably put today's main bayside traffic arteries out of commission.
Other potential impacts like floods, slides and fires could close other thoroughfares.
Buses can route around these.
Light rail is fixed.
I'll have to cross the Bay and take a test ride on the Hyroad.
Architect Edward Mazria of Santa Fe, New Mexico changed the direction of his very successful career in 2002 to focus his skills, experience and perspective on slowing global warming and motivating people to take action.
He founded Architecture 2030 because "seventy-six percent of all electricity generated by US power plants goes to supply the Building Sector.

If the story of California is the story of its water resources, the story of its alpine forests is the story of human mismanagement, natural conflagration and rising fire risk.
Unfortunately, we humans are taking what you might call a "counter-adaptive path" to living with that risk.
So, fear has squelched my dream of living in the foothills but there's more than enough people to replace folks like me.
In terms of risk management, California is not doing a very good job of it since the number of people moving into these drying, dying forest areas on the Western slopes of the Sierra increased by 16% during the Nineties.
And 94% of planned new home development is also within high fire danger areas.
What are they thinking???
?
"There is a tremendous amount of population growth going on in these extreme fire danger areas," said Autumn Bernstein, the [Sierra Nevada] alliance's land use coordinator and the author of the 45-page study, entitled "Dangerous Development: Wildfire and Rural Sprawl in the Sierra Nevada.
"
Like all forested lands, the Sierra is subject to the weakening of its forests by changing climate and the infestations that prey on vulnerable trees.
The forests will only become more flammable with time.
Two weeks ago they were baking in the midst of triple-digit temperatures as drought conditions pushed the water managers to the brink of imposing restrictions.
Now, the National Weather Service is predicting the possibility of snow in mid-September.
So much for simplifying your wardrobe to fit the warming climate.
Given the history of short- and long-term drought in California (and the fact that its southern half and most of the Central Valley are naturally semi-arid to desert regions), you'd think there would be an agency in charge of drought mitigation and adaptation.
And you'd be right!
The California Rural Water Association provides the Drought Preparedness site , which includes action plans for small towns experiencing water shortages.
As they state on their home page,
Drought is a natural occurrence and, unfortunately, one that California is familiar with.
In times of drought, those who feel the effects of water shortage the most are small water systems and their customers whose reliance on marginal wells, springs, and small creeks make them especially sensitive to annual rainfall totals.
Urban systems are undoubtedly spared compared to their smaller community counterparts.
The site provides ideas and guidelines for localities with various water sources and recommendations for water conservation and disaster management.
The content has obviously been updated in light of the recent conditions in Southern California, and wisely suggests that planning be updated.
A recent law passed by the California Legislature requires all users of publicly-provided water sources have water meters in order that water conservation measures can be made more effective.
Here's a story from the Atlanta Journal Constitution about one such conflict currently playing out in the midst of the Southeast's record-breaking drought.
Georgia and Alabama are at odds over water in the Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa River Basin.
The Army Corps of Engineers is serving as the mediator in the argument.
This is one example of a social stressor that may become much more common if drought conditions settle on other regions in the U.S. It leaves me wondering if we'll begin to see such conflicts worked out in advance of actual crisis, when the parties are able to think more clearly than they'd be able to under pressure of a severe drought.
Allatoona, which provides drinking water for Cobb County and other northwest metro Atlanta communities, has dropped 6 1/2 feet since the beginning of August, and is now more than 11 feet below full.
The low lake level has exacerbated problems with an algae bloom in the lake, leading to some odor and taste complaints about the drinking water.
The Corps, which owns and operates the federal reservoir, began releasing additional water from the lake in late July after Alabama complained of not receiving enough to mitigate effects from the historic drought.
In the worst-case scenario, Corps estimates show Allatoona could reach a record low level by the end of the year.
In what its organizers call "an unprecedented educational initiative, involving over a thousand colleges, universities, high schools, middle schools, faith groups, civic organizations and businesses," Focus the Nation is leading what amounts to a grassroots nationwide teach-in and open discussion of the climate change situation and what must be done in a hurry to prevent worst case scenarios from becoming reality.
Aiming at people young enough today to be in their prime when today's efforts to reverse carbon-loading of the atmosphere will make a difference in the years that follow, Focus the Nation has an impressive list of advisors, board members, staff and sponsors.
The record-breaking drought in Southern California adds emphasis to what everyone has always known - the story of California is the story of its water sources.
This is especially so in the southern half of the state, which is naturally a desert area.
In the previous article I noted that local government leaders were holding water rationing as their trump card in dealing with the drought, but the Los Angeles Times, in its editorial for September 13 , takes those so-called "leaders" to task for not seeing water rationing as the intelligent adaptive action that it is.
First, the editorial acknowledges the recent court ruling that restricts the amount of water that L.A. can get from the Sacramento Delta in the northern half of the state.
Two weeks ago, a federal judge ruled that state and federal water projects must limit the pumping operations that move fresh water through the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta and into the southern part of the state -- all to protect the delta smelt, an endangered fish considered a bellwether for that region's fragile ecosystem.
That may sound arcane, but it has serious everyday consequences.
The water that flows through the delta serves 25 million people, providing more than a third of Southern California's supply.
Officials estimate that the judge's ruling could cut off more than 30% of delta deliveries for at least a year.
...given the profound uncertainties facing the state's water system, the choice to wait on mandatory restrictions is puzzling.
As Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa reminded Angelenos in June when he called for (as yet unrealized) voluntary 10% reductions in water use, low local rainfall, diminished Sierra snowpacks and prolonged drought conditions on the Colorado River have combined to make this year L.A.'s driest ever.
The effects of global warming on future water supplies are still unknown.
And endangered species aren't the only threat to delta pumping: A breach in the region's unstable levees could shut down operations at any moment.
A more inspiring and productive response would capitalize on the sense of urgency and call on Los Angeles to do its part to address wider water woes now.
Careful consideration of proposals to re-engineer the delta should be one part of the effort; serious dedication to conservation, another.
Planners across the state should think twice before they allow development of lush suburbs or vast farmlands in hydrologically-challenged regions.
All Californians will have to work for a water system that works for everyone.
Today's LA Times carries an article that at least partially explains the issue that was at the center of the above editorial, i.e.
why no water restrictions have been imposed.
It seems that the drought of 1990-91 taught water managers a lesson: keep plenty of water in reserve.
So, as this article by Hector Becerra describes, the L.A. area can make it through this year's drought OK. But there may be more reason to believe now that those water reserves will not be so easily replenished, so the Water District is still planning to impose restrictions as a way to help residents get used to life with less water.
A good adaptive strategy.
Officials say they learned from that drought and spent the ensuing years building up water reserve capacity.
Despite the record dry conditions, the Metropolitan Water District has 14 times more reservoir and groundwater storage than it did in 1991, with many local reservoirs flush with water.
This is giving the region a buffer against a reduction in supplies from Northern California and the Colorado River.
So dry that they've invented the term "The Perfect Drought.
" This is Southern California I'm talking about.
This from a report by the ABC-TV affiliate in L.A .
Southern California is now in its eighth year of an extended drought.
But what would happen if that drought lasted for decades, or even a century?
Some experts say the pieces are falling into place for a so-called "perfect drought," and it could have devastating consequences for California.
This was supposed to be the climate change future?
What happened to put in into the present?
WTF????
"If this continues for another year or two like this, we'll have a full-fledged drought and we'll need to take more drastic steps," said David Nahai, president of Department Water and Power (DWP).
Drastic steps, such as a return of the drought busters who roamed the streets of L.A. issuing citations during our last major drought from '87 to '92.
Government forecasters with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have announced they believe another La Nina is on the way.
That weather phenomenon is a periodic cooling of surface temperatures in the Pacific that's expected to bring drier-than-normal conditions this fall to an already drought-stricken Southern California.
I grew up in Montgomery County, Maryland, bordering Washington, D.C. My mother still lives there and reports that she has to mow her acre-and-a-half lawn much less frequently now that a drought as set in.
There are still a few farmers left in this overdeveloped expanse of bedroom neighborhoods for our bloated government industrial operation.
The Washington Post recently carried this story: Drought Shrivels Farmers' Crops and Income .
Lechlider said it's the worst he has ever seen -- and that's saying a lot for a man who has raised pigs and grown sod, corn, soybeans and hay in northern Montgomery County for more than half a century.
He's 86 and still going strong, but summers like this test even hearty men like him, he said.
It's not just Montgomery.
According to an analysis by the National Drought Mitigation Center, 97 percent of the state is experiencing abnormally dry conditions.
Amidst all the reporting of drought covering the entire American Southwest and Southeast, the fact that much of the East Coast is drying out adds a dimension to the problem.
If we're in just the beginning of what could be a period of worsenng drought, it's clear that we could be seeing impacts not only on the livelihoods of farmers, but on consumers who would have bought those farmers' products.
If we have to migrate agricultural production to where temperature ranges, seasonal length and precipitation will support it, when and where do we start this kind of adaptation?
Joe over at Climate Progress once again points us to stake-raising news, this time in an article just published in Science (subscription required).
The gist of it is that forecasts from in the latest IPCC report underestimate the pace and impact of current changes due to global warming.
The broad consensus required among scientists and participating national agendas to publish the IPCC's conclusions served as a censor to many findings which are now being confirmed as accurate.
The emphasis on consensus in IPCC reports, however, has put the spotlight on expected outcomes, which then become anchored via numerical estimates in the minds of policy-makers.
With the general credibility of the science of climate change established, it is now equally important that policy-makers understand the more extreme possibilities that consensus may exclude or downplay.
The IPCC group did not include many of the feedback effects on ice sheet melting or carbon emissions released from natural storage sources as temperatures rise.
These effects - which are well under way right now - stand to accelerate impacts such as sea level rise well beyond the stated limits in the IPCC's conclusions.
This is critical information for dynamic risk assessment, preparation, adaptation and certainly for mitigation action.
[N]ational governments now need to confront a more fundamental question of how often they need comprehensive assessments of climate change.
Addressing the special risks entailed in particular aspects of the climate system, like the ice sheets or carbon cycle, might be better approached by increasing the number of concise, highly focused special reports that can be completed relatively quickly by smaller groups, perhaps even by competing teams of experts.
At this juncture, full assessments emphasizing consensus, which are a major drain on participants and a deflection from research, may not be needed more than once per decade.
Preparing for Climate Change: a Guidebook for Local, Regional and State Governments was written by a collaboration the Center for Science in the Earth System (Climate Impacts Group of King County, Washington) and the Joint Institute for the Study of Atmosphere and Ocean at the University of Washington.
The Guidebook is being distributed to 250 member cities, towns and counties of the ICLEI Local Governments for Sustainability .
As it turns out, Marin County is a member of this organization and will be receiving a copy through that route as well.
Within a handful of decades, climate in many parts of the United States is expected to be significantly warmer than even the warmest years of the 20th century, increasing the risk of drought, flooding, forest fires, disease, and other impacts across many regions.
Public decision makers have a critical opportunity – and a need – to start preparing today for the impacts of climate change.
Preparing for climate change is not a “one size fits all” process, however.
Just as the impacts of climate change will vary from place to place, the combination of institutions and legal and political tools available to public decision-makers are unique from region to region.
Preparedness actions will need to be tailored to the circumstances of different communities.
South Florida's record-breaking drought continues as local water managers throw up their hands in frustration.
As the Palm Beach Post reports , with no rain on the horizon and the level of Lake Okeechobee at an all-time low for this time of the year, a near miss by a tropical storm during what's left of the hurricane season would be a blessing.
But even that brings the threat that a downpour might cause damaging flooding because pumps to handle the sudden accumulation of water in the flat near-sea-level area have lost their prime.
"This is history - we've never been here before," said district board member Malcolm "Bubba" Wade, a senior vice president of United States Sugar Corp. "This drought's already having an impact, and it's going to get much, much worse.
"
Options for replenishing Lake Okeechobee at this point appear to be limited to pumping water a long distance from the West Palm Beach Canal and returning polluted agricultural runoff to the lake.
The latter idea has sparked heated debate, but with no rain, there's no runoff to pump.
William Collins was the keynote speaker for yesterday's California Climate Change Conference .
Collins is a professor at U.C.
Berkeley and a senior scientist and head of the department of Climate Science at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
He has a Ph.D. in astrophysics and he's conducted research on the observation and modeling of the Earth's climate system at both the National Center for Atmospheric Research and Scripps Institute of Oceanography.
He is a lead author of the IPCC Assessment, Working Group I, which covered the physical science of global warming.
His talk was titled "the Future of California's Climate from a Global Perspective.
" ( see here for the slides ) He came loaded with explanatory graphics and statistics, and was suitably cautious in getting anywhere near predicting specifics, so the conclusions of his analysis were conservative.
And here they are:
Warming increases with increasing levels of atmospheric CO2.
There are real prospects for more dynamic coupling of climate modeling, impacts, adaptation, and mitigation.
A new term for our mission: MITIGAPTATION.
No, I don't expect that I'll ever actually pronounce it in conversation, but it makes my point here, which is that we cant' afford to abandon either of the two approaches to climate change.
We must learn to practice both mitigation and adaptation simultaneously.
Mitigation is critical to lessen the future impact of global warming and prevent feedback processes from setting off runaway deadly (to humans) overheating of the environment.
Adaptation is essential because there's no way - no matter how effective our mitigation - that we're going to escape the impacts of the current growing carbon concentration in the atmosphere.
If the impacts catch you now, you'll have your hands full adapting.
Just ask the folks affected by Katrina and last summer's floods in the Midwest.
Those of us who have not been fully impacted by climate change must insist that both our governments and the companies that provide us with products and services make drastic changes to reduce carbon emissions.
In our own lives, we must make the same kinds of changes in our buying and living habits.
These are both mitigating and adapting behaviors.
Get used to it or be prepared to scramble aboard what might be a comparatively uncomfortable adaptive bandwagon.
I've just been introduced by Rick Piltz of Climate Science Watch to a new consulting group called Adaptation Network , a project of Earth Island Institute (which, as many of you know, was founded by the late environmental pioneer David Brower.
)
Adaptations we make to climatic change need to be aimed at making systems more resilient and healthy now and in the long run.
Resilient, healthy systems can better withstand perturbations of all types than systems that are unbalanced or at the edge of their survival.
Making a system more resilient could mean reducing pressures that are already stressing the system.
It could mean providing greenways and migration routes for plants and animals that need to move to better match the environment that is best for them.
It could mean restoring natural floodways to allow the natural system to better protect the built environment.
It could mean investing in long-term projects that reduce vulnerability (of people, infrastructure, or even investments) rather than increasing it.
It could mean investing in educating the public to increase their awareness and availability of more environmentally friendly choices and options open to them.
In short, adaptation action can vary greatly from one location to another.
That is also why adaptation may require a significant level of planning and feedback prior to and following implementation.
One of the presenters at the California Climate Change Conference this past Monday was Noah Knowles, a research hydrologist with the U.S. Geological Survey, based in Menlo Park, CA.
He presented some new maps of the San Francisco Bay and Sacramento Delta that provide a much more accurate assessment of the risks of inundation due to sea level rise.
Here's the PDF of his presentation with samples of their maps.
Below is an image of San Francisco showing the Embarcadero and downtown areas.
Using photogramettry - where aerial photographs taken from six different angles were digitally processed to yield maps with vertical scale accuracy of 10-20 cm - combined with tide data, he described the current situation where, on a daily basis, about 500 square kilometers of tidal land and land protected by levees are below water level at high tide.
With a 1-meter rise in sea level, that area would increase by 30% and would - under the current circumstances - be inundated at high tide.
That would include all of the levee-dependent islands and agricultural lands of the Delta and much developed land surrounding the Bay including much of our highway system.
Risk assessment for the impacts of climate change must be an active, ongoing, constantly-updated process.
We're learning all the time, especially about feedback systems that affect the speed of change.
Here's an example of where the risk assessment for sea level rise is suddenly requiring a significant adjustment.
The quickening pace of ice breaking off from the Greenland icecap means that our current estimates of sea level rise are both too low and too slow.
The accelerating thaw and the earthquakes are intimately connected, according to [Finnish scientist Veli Albert Kallio], as immense slabs of ice are sheared from the bed rock by melt water.
Those blocks of ice, often more than 800m deep and 1500m long, contain immense rocks as well and move against geological faults with seismic consequences.
The study of these ice quakes is still in its infancy, according to [American polar expert Robert Correll], but their occurence is in itself disturbing.
"It is becoming a lot more volatile," said Mr Vallio.
Predictions made by the Arctic Council, a working group of regional scientists, have been hopelessly overrun by the extent of the thaw.
"Five years ago we made models predicting how much ice would melt and when," said Mr Kallio.
"Five years later we are already at the levels predicted for 2040, in a year's time we'll be at 2050.
"
Exhibit A: The Administration refuses to issue a mandated public assessment of the risks of climate change.
As it turns out, the Global Change Research Act, which mandated the assessment, did not specify the form that the assessment should take, so the Administration is likely (based on its history with regards to global warming) to issue "assessments" that disemble and confuse rather than clarify our situation.
This led to Richard Moss, the former head of Bush's Climate Change Research Program to speak out against the low standards the Administration is setting for its responsibility to the public.
Richard Moss, who ran the climate change office under Bush until 2006, called it "unfortunate" that the ruling criticized the timing of the reports but failed to force CCSP to integrate its findings.
"The Administration should be held to a higher standard than just what a judge finds follows the letter of the law," says Moss, adding that Americans deserve a "full soup-to-nuts national assessment" of how climate change will impact them.
[emphasis added]
It's well worth your while to have some idea of what may be in store for you and your hometown in a climate changing future.
Finding, gathering and acting on that knowledge before the impacts of global warming arrive at your door may save your home, your town, your life.
Your federal government is not helping you accumulate that knowledge.
In fact, the current Administration has actively stifled the distribution of scientific findings on global warming.
State governments are not much better at educating us, preparing us, protecting us and keeping us informed about this critical situation.
[I'd like to hear from you about any exceptions to that.
] And as we all know, the Feds seem to have their hands full with a war.
I hate to write this, but if current trends continue a lot of people are going to end up leaving the homes they live in today, for reasons of climate change.
It may be the threat of destruction or the destruction itself, but just as flooding and drought are forcing people to reassess their situations this summer in England and Australia and the American Midwest, many more people will have to do so in the not-so-distant future.
I realize that such a statement is going to set off an emotional reaction in those of you currently invested in your homes, neighborhoods and regions.
I don't blame you; it's an outrageous scenario.
But if you live where a 2-foot rise in sea level will put your front yard under water at high tide; or if you live in a desert only made habitable by importing water from a long distance, then you should really know and understand the scientific assessments of your risks.
We're no longer living in a benign climatic condition, where extreme weather visited us rarely enough that we didn't have to worry.
We're currently seeing records broken for heat, rainfall, drought and storm intensity all over the planet.
We're losing the overall stability that characterized weather for as long as we've been keeping records.
You can no longer take for granted that the weather patterns you've lived with in your location for 50 years will be your weather patterns for the future.
I believe we last saw that when America entered World War II.
Global warming has the potential to be much more destructive than the Axis Powers.
We, the people, need to mobilize not only to change our energy habits, but to prepare for the global warming effects that are already heading down the tracks toward us.
Are you curious about how climate change will affect you and your home location?
I’m sure that’s in the backs of many people’s minds today, with so much talk of global warming and so many news stories of floods, drought and record-breaking heat.
I’m also going to continue to report news about climate-related impacts around the world and how those are being dealt with by the unfortunate souls who happen to be in their way.
Between the science and the facts on the ground, you may be able to gather enough information to take some protective or preventative local action.
At least I hope to motivate you to demand that your public officials provide you with ongoing risk assessments based on the most current science.
The science is advancing rapidly and so are some of the key factors that will determine tipping points in climate change.
On the global level, we know that a lot of formerly permanent ice is melting at an accelerating rate.
We’re also seeing some of the predicted markers of global warming appearing sooner than expected – extended droughts, extreme flooding, major heat waves.
But the science of localized forecasting is still immature and not tailored for use by those of us who are not climatologists.
Here’s an example.
This is an article posted 10 days ago on RealClimate , probably the most valuable hard science blog for following climate change.
It’s titled Regional Climate Projections and it describes the different climate models that were incorporated into the findings of the fourth assessment report from the IPCC .
The climate models are all structured to evaluate global processes, so breaking them down into regionally relevant reports is difficult.
The closest we get, in this article, to localized projections is the assessment for North America, and here’s where the language barrier comes into play.
A number of RCM-based studies provide further regional details (North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program).
Despite improvements, AR4 also states that RCM simulations are sensitive to the choice of domain, the parameterisation of moist convection processes (representation of clouds and precipitation), and that there are biases in the RCM results when GCM are provided as boundary conditions rather than re-analyses.
Radiative-convective models (RCMs) and general dirculation models (GCMs) are beyond what us non-scientists are trained to understand.
But the current drought and heat in the American Southwest are conditions that these models forecast, as is the intensifying of all weather conditions.
We’re also seeing the migration of the average temperature lines toward the poles.
Growing seasons are longer.
Regions that have always had hard freezes during the winter are seeing warmer winters.
So I’m going to start simply and safely by emphasizing the climatic vulnerabilities of certain geographical situations.
If you live near the ocean, you’re sea level infrastructure and housing is at risk.
If you live on a floodplain, you’re risk of flooding may be increasing.
If you live where summers are hot, look for them to get hotter.
If you live in a desert environment, expect it to become drier.
Jon Lebkowsky , one of the merry band who do such a great job of bringing us interesting and useful news at WorldChanging , interviewed me (online) over the past couple of weeks and the whole thing is there now, in two parts.
Part One is mostly about my history as a back-to-the-land communard and online communities pioneer.
Part Two focuses more on my current interest in dealing with the impacts of climate change.
If it stops raining where you live and stays that way for long enough, your life must change.
Unless you can find water from other sources - drilling new wells, importing it from a distance, desalination of ocean water - you'll be forced at least to ration your uses of water, as will everyone in the affected region.
No more watering the lawn or washing the car.
No more filling the pool and taking those long showers.
The cost to you of whatever water is left may rise to cover the expenses of importing, manufacturing or preserving it.
I've subscribed to Google Alerts for "drought," which gets me a daily email of stories containing that word.
I get a lot of sports stories describing baseball players and their "hitting droughts.
" But there are plenty of places in the world currently suffering prolonged lack of water.
The impacts range from ranchers destroying livestock to starving elephants raiding villages to recreational lakes drying up and leaving boats sitting in the mud.
Of course, drought dries up agricultural land and raises the risk of fires .
Drought indirectly raises the prices of agricultural products.
It stresses trees , making them vulnerable to bugs and disease.
Farmers are the most directly affected by drought.
They will seek relief from the government if their crops can't grow.
Those whose businesses are indirectly affected by the drought - markets that sell fruits, vegetables, dairy and meat products - don't get that kind of relief.
They seek other sources and raise their prices accordingly.
The consumers bear the brunt of the passed-along costs.
Extended drought , which can go on for years and even decades, can not only drive farmers and ranchers out of business, but can lead to whole communities being uprooted and whole regions becoming dustbowls.
Water tables drop and wells dry up.
Rivers shrink.
Water rationing becomes so severe that residents move to other moister climes.
Vegetative cover dies off, leaving the soil vulnerable to severe erosion if and when a good rain storm happens.
In areas subject to flooding, you can move to higher ground.
In an area going through a long period of drought, there's no refuge.
Here's the constantly updated U.S. Drought Monitor map , provided by the National Drought Mitigation Center in Lincoln, Nebraska.
Note the "exceptional" drought conditions in the Southeast.
I've been blogging on climate change for all of six months now and I've learned a lot about the lay of the blogosphere and where the most pressing needs are, at least in the United States.
I see that there are plenty of good sites with outstanding reporters and writers to keep us up to date on the current extreme weather situation, the global atmospheric carbon status and the lagging federal legislation regarding emissions limits.
There's Al Gore's movie and the ongoing training of presenters who keep his famous slide show circulating to new audiences.
I link to what I consider to be the best of these sites.
These are all wonderful efforts and they get my standing ovation.
But I sense that there is too little effort in bringing it all back home, to the local level where citizens see climate change in terms of how it will impact them and their communities.
As I've reported here , the local county officials could tell me nothing about climate-related contingency planning for Marin County.
Yet, with all the stories about extreme weather - and with all the actual experiences that communities are going through due to extreme weather - you know that many of us have questions and concerns about when and how it's going to hit us and our lifestyles.
So Climate Frog is from here on out going to focus on answering local questions for the concerned citizen.
This does not mean that I'm going to go out on the thin limbs and try to predict the future for each location and microclimate in the world.
I'm not so dumb as to assume that's possible.
But through research and sharing knowledge, I'm going make Climate Frog into a knowledge resource for doing your own local research and for getting more people involved locally so that your community can have its risks realistically assessed for climate change impacts.
I'll still report on climatic events and findings from around the world, but more with the perspective of the local community learning from the experiences of others.
When we report on the flooding in England, it will be to learn how much damage can be done, how victims recover and respond to the disaster, and how government at all levels acts to protect its citizens.
I lean in the direction of local empowerment and believe that it's unwise today to depend on higher levels of government to deal competently with situations at the local level.
We've seen (and continue to see) the debacle of Katrina.
And though some works can only be handled at the federal and state levels, it's critical that citizens be the driving force for specialized preparation and response for the fast-evolving climate change situation.
Next week I'll be attending the Fourth Annual Climate Change Research Conference in Sacramento.
Sponsored by the California Energy Commission & California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA), this four-day event brings together scientists and policy makers to share the most up-to-date findings and challenges regarding global warming and its impacts on the varied ecosystems and population centers in the state.
This will be an opportunity for me to meet other individuals and organizational representatives with interests in this area, and it will provide me with a good baseline for where government agencies are currently positioned with regard to climate change risk assessment.
As my next post explains, I'm narrowing my focus and adding another wrinkle to the mission of Climate Frog.
Collecting reports of local climate change impacts and responses from around the world, I'm accumulating a database that can be used for strategic planning by other localities as lessons learned, best practices and valuable contacts.
Chris Mooney (Washington correspondent for Seed magazine, owner of the blog The Intersection , and author of the forthcoming book Storm World: Hurricanes, Politics, and the Battle Over Global Warming ) wrote this article for Truthdig , which does a great job of putting the imperative of preparing our most vulnerable coastal cities from storm damage into words.
The estimated damage total if the devastating 1926 Miami hurricane were to occur today is a staggering $164 billion
As the National Hurricane Center notes , as of 1990, 85 percent of U.S. coastal residents had never experienced a major hurricane landfall.
Since that time, the number of these inexperienced residents has only increased, as what some hurricane scientists dub our “lemming-like march to the sea” has proceeded apace.
Today, 53 percent of the U.S. population lives within 50 miles of a coastline.
Let’s move now with a national project to protect our most vulnerable areas against hurricane devastation, not just for the present, but with an eye toward our globally warmed future.
We can prioritize by starting with the most exposed places and then moving down the list.
My wife recently returned from visiting her mother in Scottsdale, Arizona.
She was amazed at the continuing pace of development in the Valley of the Sun.
The highways are clogged, housing developments continue to spread in every direction from Phoenix toward the mountains that bound the broad flats of the valley.
People apparently continue to flock to that location, where the recent summers have seen extended stretches of 110-degree-plus heat.
I've written here about the concern over water supply for the millions of residents of this desert region.
Today, USA Today published a story about the prospects of a moister future, and those prospects are slim to none.
The lede:
Drought, a fixture in much of the West for nearly a decade, now covers more than one-third of the continental USA.
And it's spreading.
Of course, the Southwest is not the only region suffering extreme drought.
The Southeast is about 50 inches behind in precipitation.
The central valley of California sees cattle ranchers selling off their herds.
"It seems extremely likely that drought will become more the norm" for the West, says Kathy Jacobs of the Arizona Water Institute, a research partnership of the state's three universities.
"Droughts will continue to come and go, but … higher temperatures are going to produce more water stress.
"
So what I'm looking for is the first indication that growth in population and land development is slowing down in these desert regions that were only settled because technology allowed water to be supplied through unnatural means.
When even our dams, pumps and deep water wells aren't enough, and rationing cuts into lifestyle issues, what will residents do.
And where will they go?
Collecting reports of local climate change impacts and responses from around the world, I'm accumulating a database that can be used for strategic planning by other localities as lessons learned, best practices and valuable contacts.
An alliance of eight major water utilities that provide drinking water to 36 million people is calling on the US Climate Change Science Program and the science community to aid in assessing and managing risks to water infrastructure and supply from impacts of warming, diminishing snowpack, bigger storms, drought, rising sea level, and potential abrupt climate change.
Climate Science Watch has called attention to water issues as a high near-term priority in linking the federal climate research program to decisionmaking intelligence and preparedness needs.
February 26 —Review of the Summary of Revised Research Plan for the US Climate Change Science Program
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Eight of the top U.S. water utilities are joining forces to study how rising sea levels, droughts and other effects of global warming are taking a toll on supplies of drinking water, they said on Tuesday.
The coalition, known as the Water Utility Climate Alliance, said water agencies need access to the best possible climate change research as they prepare to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in infrastructure over the next 15 years.
“Our systems are facing risk due to diminishing snowpack, bigger storms, more frequent drought and rising sea levels,” said Susan Leal, general manager of the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission, a member of the alliance.
“We need to be organized to respond to these risks—that’s why we’ve formed this alliance.”
Other members of the coalition include Denver Water, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, the New York City Department of Environmental Protection, the Portland Water Bureau, the San Diego County Water Authority, the Seattle Public Utilities and the Southern Nevada Water Authority.
Altogether, the WUCA members supply drinking water for more than 36 million people, the alliance said.
Last month, scientists at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography said a water supply crisis was looming in the western United States thanks to human-caused climate change that has already altered the region’s river flows, snow packs and air temperatures.
In its first official act, the WUCA said it is urging the U.S. Climate Change Science Program and researchers in the climate change field to improve and refine climate models to apply them at the regional or local level and to ensure that water providers have access to consistent climate data.
The coalition also called on scientists to coordinate international research efforts and to develop tools for policy-making and planning for abrupt climate changes.
...The group has been in the works since 2007, after San Francisco hosted a water utility climate change summit that drew more than 200 executives and government officials.
In September, the eight agencies gathered to further discuss the impacts of climate change and began studying existing research.
“The whole goal was to wrap our arms around the potential impacts of climate change on water infrastructure and water supplies,” said Bronson Mack, a spokesman for the Southern Nevada Water Authority.
Over a series of conference calls, Mack said the newly formed group has developed a list of goals that include expanding climate change research, collaborating on adaptation tools and identifying greenhouse gas emissions from individual operations.
Today, I see a brilliant blue sky out my window.
I can't tell that there' s more carbon dioxide up there then there was last year.
It's tempting to think, "Why worry?
Why change anything?
"
I focus on local preparation for adaptation to a changing climate because I know, based on assurances by a preponderance of scientific investigation, that the impacts of climate change will come, probably sooner than we'd like to think.
Most of us, it seems, choose to not think about it.
And that spurs me further to do what I can to advance adaptation planning.
Who is responsible for educating and motivating the public about this stuff?
There are countless other climate/green organizations, agencies and web sites.
Al Gore got his Academy Award and Nobel Prize.
The IPCC shared the Nobel and is now known worldwide for having substantiated the evidence of big problems ahead.
I have automatic web searches dumping more climate-related articleson my desktop every day than I can possibly read.
The information to lead our actions is available and plentiful.
So why aren't things moving as they must to prevent catastrophic impacts in our future?
You'll notice that none of the presidential candidates even mention climate change.
Today's NY Times editorial urges Clinton and Obama to elevate their campaigns "to a serious debate about major issues," none of which happens to be climate related.
This is absurd.
I'm thinking that the best way to penetrate the average U.S. citizen's crisis fatigue is to make the climate change threat a local one - to describe it in terms of what might happen in each person's back yard.
The prospect of having to abandon one's lush landscaping or of upsetting one's ability to commute to work or of having high tide covering the local high school's athletic fields is a lot less abstract than presenting the threats as "global.
" Which is not to say that the global perspective deserves to be ignored; billions of lives are at stake.
BROOKLIN, Canada, Jan 2 (IPS) - Dan Bloom thinks it's time to figure out how to build self-sustaining cities in the polar regions because climate change will eventually make most of Earth uninhabitable.
These polar cities may be "humankind's only chance for survival if global warming really turns into a worldwide catastrophe in the far distant future," Bloom told IPS.
Bloom isn't a scientist or any other kind of expert.
A U.S. citizen in his late fifties living in Taiwan teaching English, he's lived all over the world as a reporter-editor, teacher-translator and author.
And now Bloom wants to shake people out their everyday indifference to the great emergency of our age: climate change.
Cavendish cites studies that suggest a kind of herd mentality.
If climate change is a problem, then people would be doing something about it.
Since they're not, then there is no problem.
However, once people are aware of this dangerous tendency to follow the herd over the cliff, we can break away and forge our own more sensible path, she says.
His Quixotic quest began less than a year ago.
Having heard various conflicting news reports about climate change, Bloom decided to research the subject as thoroughly as he could.
The genesis of the polar cities idea came from a dire op-ed by the eminent British scientist James Lovelock in January 2006 in the Independent newspaper.
Lovelock wrote that the Earth will heat up far faster than any scientist expects due to many positive feedbacks such as melting of Arctic and Antarctic ice.
"... Before this century is over billions of us will die and the few breeding pairs of people that survive will be in the Arctic where the climate remains tolerable," he wrote.
If catastrophic climate change was a very real possibility, why not start now to prepare sustainable polar retreats just in case.
More importantly, simply imagining that polar cities may be needed one day for the very survival of the human race might wake people to the threat climate change poses, he says.
But polar cities is an idea that many climate change experts refuse to consider.
Most of the climate scientists IPS contacted for this story declined to comment.
Those who did respond said imagining such a future was not productive when humanity needs to focus on "how the world can drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions".
"It's silly to think 200 or 300 years into future, it's more useful to think 20 or 30 years out," said Ross Gelbspan, a former Washington Post-Boston Globe reporter and author of several books on climate change.
Gelbspan has done a great deal of thinking about the near future as the impacts of climate change take hold.
There is no stopping the future deaths of millions of people from climate change, he believes.
The only question is how many millions.
His future scenarios range from a totalitarian nightmare in response to climate-driven mass migrations and social chaos to real world peace.
His best guess today is we will see those extremes, and everything in between.

I see nothing in down to earth simple talk.
I really don’t care how global warming got started or who’s most at fault, that won’t make global warming stop.

Global warming, what’s that?
Not on this planet!
New Yorkers, who have some of the best senses of humor (and tragedy) in the world, might get a kick out of the newly-created Vaclav Klaus Climate Joke Awards, to honor “jokers” in the climate denial “movement”.
We need some fact-Czechers to help this effort out, completely nonprofit and not funded at all by the oily indstries.

This inability to comprehend is, most disappointingly, shared with the people who are responsible for planning the spacial and physical changes to the infrastructure and facilities we depend on as residents of our local areas.
Sea level rise is an apt climate change impact to use because the preponderance of projections for how fast it will rise make it seem like not much of a threat.
When most planners accept a pace of a foot of rise over the next 40 years, there's not much urgency there.
A few sea walls, some levees, some pumps...no problemo.
But such estimates ignore the low percentage risks that the sea level might rise much faster than that.
The two authors, Jonathan Barnett and Kristina Hill, have studied the actions of local planners and have concluded that for the most part, climate change has not yet shown up on their radars.
As far as we can tell, most designers and planners aren’t thinking seriously about climate change in the U.S. unless they work closely with the insurance industry, which is dropping tens of thousands of East Coast customers and raising rates on the rest, in part as a result of climate predictions.
Ecologists all over the world also know that it’s a very big deal.
The World Bank knows.
But building and landscape architects, engineers, and planners don’t seem to have connected the dots.
Jonathan, the other author of this article, worked on the first reconstruction plan for New Orleans after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and saw the devastation from a storm surge that could have been prevented if the flood walls had been properly constructed.
He became frustrated with the many comments from people outside New Orleans that the city had simply been built in the wrong location and ought to be a write-off, and he began to wonder what would happen if we applied the same standard to other places.
Biloxi and other Gulf Coast cities also suffered severe damage from Katrina and Rita.
Key West had flooding comparable to that in New Orleans from Rita.
If we looked around the country at other vulnerable cities, we’d have to write off many more than New Orleans.
By working with large insurance companies, government regulators could encourage rationality when either the private sector or public agencies make major investments in coastal urban futures.
Important dialogues could begin about how to share the significant investment costs of adapting coastal areas to sea-level rise and new flooding patterns.
Because they would bring insurers and institutional leaders together, these new investment and cost-sharing discussions provide a way to allow flexible design and planning solutions to emerge that would be insurable, politically feasible, and recognize the need for social equity in how citizens are protected from immediate and longer-term dangers.
ESPACE (European Spacial Planning Adapting to Climate Events) is an international project acting on the belief - as stated by German Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel - that,
"We have to start adapting to climate change now so as to not be overwhelmed by its economic and social consequences later.
"
Part I of this project took place between 2003 and 2007.
It aimed "to promote awareness of the importance of adapting to climate change and to recommend that it is incorporated within spatial planning mechanisms at local, regional, national and European levels.
Focussing on North West Europe, ESPACE [looked] at how we manage our water resources and plan for a future with a changing climate.
"
Through the delivery of ESPACE Part I , we have found that there are some major obstacles to the delivery and implementation of adaptation to climate change at the local level.
Examine why policies at higher levels promoting adaptation fail to be translated into actions on the ground.
This will improve our understanding of what is needed in terms of co-ordination and management to achieve adaptation to climate change.
Develop an ‘Organisational Change Tool’ through in depth evidence and theory based research.
This tool will give organisations a clear understanding of the things that need to work together and be supported for them to be able to respond to climate risks.
The idea has been raised several times in the 25 years I've lived in Marin County, but this time there seems to be much more resolve around it - to build a desalination plant to provide potable water to supplement the county's watershed-collected source.
According to the drought forecast map maintained by the U.S. Government's National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS) , Marin County sits near the northern boundary of the "persistent drought" region in the American Southwest.
Just north of us is the region labeled "dought ongoing, some improvement.
"
The prospects look threatening enough that the Marin Municipal Water District (MMWD) has released a report to begin the environmental impact study of the various energy sources required to power the plant.
The project is proposed to roll out in three progressive stages, each adding 5 million gallons a day to the county's supply.
In addition to adding water, the project adds substantionally to the county's energy needs.
The energy requirements summarized in Table 1 indicate that the projected electricity demand for operation of a new desalination plant will be substantial, representing an 85%, 162% and 246% increase above current MMWD electricity needs for the 5 mgd, 10 mgd and 15 mgd capacity phases, respectively.
The county is considering many alternative energy sources, from methane harvested at the county landfill to photovoltaic arrays and even tidal energy generators.
This could be a good test case of how fast adaptation planning can progress at this time, when a crisis may be looming within the next year.
We've got the situation in Georgia staring us in the face - a stark illustration of what happens to a region without a backup plan for drought.
Of course, I've been asking this question all along in Climate Frog.
I just don't qualify as "major media," or even - at this point - "minor media.
" I'm a guy looking at the reality and wondering when - like the frog - we're going to cop to what's going on and start making some contingency plans.
For Atlanta, it's late in the game.
The plans should have been made long ago.
Engelhardt is not judgmental in his essay; he's looking at the big picture, where many regions are facing the "what then" question and many millions of people stand to be affected to a life-or-death degree.
I know answers to the "and then" question are not easy or necessarily simple.
But if drought -- or call it "desertification" -- becomes more widespread, more common in heavily populated parts of the globe already bursting at the seams (and with more people arriving daily), if whole regions no longer have the necessary water, how many trails of tears, how many of those mass migrations or civilizational collapses are possible?
How much burning and suffering and misery are we likely to experience?
And what then?
California's semi-arid Central Valley is one of the great garden regions of the world, but its fertility depends almost entirely on water transported over distance to irrigate its fields, vinyards and orchards.
In recent decades, many farmers have converted acreage from annually-planted field crops to permanent crops such as nuts and grapes.
But as this L.A. Times story describes , the current drought and changes in state water allocations is forcing many farmers to consider reversing the process.
The impact will first hit the farmers themselves, forcing them to adapt their businesses to a more uncertain future water supply.
But in the short run, it doesn't seem that consumers will need to adjust to shortages or higher prices.
There are still fruits and vegetables being produced in Central and South America.
"My water manager calls it an impending Armageddon, and I would probably agree with that," said Bob Polito, who grows avocados in Valley Center in San Diego County.
Prices for consumers probably wouldn't change because cuts in supply could be replaced by imports.
But the state's overall agricultural output would be affected, said Chris Scheuring, a lawyer with the California Farm Bureau Federation's natural resources and environmental division.
The BBC invited its Web readers to submit questions to an expert on urban flooding about the chances that the widespread and severe flooding of this past spring and summer would repeat itself in the future.
Given the wake-up call from the extensive damage, localities and the national government have said all the right things about improvements in flood mitigation and readiness.
Professor Tom Coulthard, of the Department of Geography at the University of Hull points out some of the all-too-human obstacles to the most obvious solutions.
First there's the issue of who owns the responsibility for factors like flood water drainage.
Then there's the issue of whether property owners will consent to having their property registered as being in a flood zone.
Your local water utility should have a DG5 register of properties/areas liable to flooding from sewers, and it may help to be registered on that.
But people are reluctant to do this as it may blight houses when it comes to re-selling them.
There were several questions - of course - about allowing development on flood plains.
This is being made more difficult by zoning restrictions, but some places still seem to be able to force development through, based on local economic benefits.
Professor Coulthard described the following idea as one way to develop a flood plain with minimal land use and coverage by paving.
Multi storey development, with water resistant garages in the ground floor - that can be flooded is one idea that could allow for development on floodplains.
I think we need to be creative and think more about living with flooding rather than just trying to stop it.
For most of the questions, the professor had no clear black and white answers.
His final sentence summed it up: "It is a difficult issue though and there is no simple answer.
" We've made so many changes in the natural shape of the land in our watersheds, that property rights get in the way of wise land use.
Only if Nature reclaims its natural flood plains through repeated destruction will we let loose of the lands we've occupied so boldly.
The six city study was meant to serve as an initial scan of Toronto's climate risk exposure.
Ian Burton, Scientist Emeritus, Environment Canada wrote the Introduction and he states the overall case for adaptation - as differentiated from mitigation - very well.
The benefits of adaptation fall largely where the costs are expended.
If a city protects itself from storms, floods, droughts, heat waves, invasive pests, species, and diseases, it is the people of the city that benefit.
Their environment is better, their health is more protected, and their economic activities are less liable to damage and disruption.
Many political leaders and business managers in cities have enlightened attitudes to the problem of climate change and would like to make a contribution to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and so they should.
However, mitigation requires action at senior levels of government – provincially, federally and internationally.
The primary task of municipal leaders is to care for their own citizens.
That is what they are elected to do.
Why should the leaders of Toronto and other Canadian municipalities grasp the threats and opportunities of climate change adaptation vigorously with both hands?
They should act because adaptation is now an imperative, and because it is primarily their responsibility to see that it happens.
This research by CAP is therefore timely and appropriate.
That's the Climate Frog speaking, but don't you think she has a point?
If only because a frog (not an alarmist blogger) is saying it, it's not a scary statement.
It's a plain and simple choice.
It's a mistake to think that you're adapting only for new weather patterns in your neck of the woods.
You're adapting to the impact in your neck of the woods of changes that are happening elsewhere, miles or thousands of miles distant, not all of them climate-driven:
changing climate all over the world, which will affect the global economy
changing climate where your food comes from, which will affect what you can buy and eat
Gristmill provides a great article on Seattle regional transportation initiatives voted on in the recent election.
In " Transportation and climate get hitched ," Eric de Place describes how "voters just sank an $18 billion transportation megaproposal that would have built more than 180 lanes miles of highway and 50 miles of light rail.
"
The local media seems to have missed the most significant factor in the vote - the extent to which climate impact concerns drove voters' choices.
And that voters on both sides of the issue - for and against the proposal - considered that their votes were pro-environment.
In the run-up to the vote, a surprising amount of the debate centered on the package's climate implications.
(The state has committed to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050, and many cities, including Seattle, have been national leaders on climate.
)
The opposition argued global warming.
So did the measure's supporters.
If you don't believe me, see, among others, the Seattle P-I (yes), The Stranger (no), the Yes Campaign , the Sierra Club's No Campaign , the right-leaning Washington Policy Center (no), and even the anti-tax/rail No Campaign , which oddly enough kept trumpeting the Sierra Club's opposition as a primary reason to vote no.
The turning point may have been when King County Executive Ron Sims suddenly withdrew his support .
He cited the climate-warming emissions from added traffic as one of his chief objections -- he was thinking about his granddaughters, he said, not just the next five years.
It's not just Marin, with its plans to start desalinating Bay water, or just southern California with its record dry spell, but it's the rest of the Sierra snowpack-dependent portion of the state that's facing possible rationing.
So say the water authorities in this SF Chronicle piece .
La Nina is back and it's being blamed for the prolonged drought in the American Southeast already.
California needs an especially wet winter if it is to fill its reservoirs and abide by court-ordered restrictions to reduce pumping by up to a third from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, said John Leahigh, a top administrator with the State Water Project.
But it's already been drier than normal, and unless we get way above normal rain and snow this winter, we'll already be starting with a deficit come next year's dry season.
The environmental protection of the Delta Smelt has also prompted a court order to pump less water out of the Sacramento river that would normally go to agriculture and domestic users.
The dry conditions have left state and federal reservoirs below normal levels.
Additionally, state water managers over the summer had to draw down reservoirs to make up for the court decision that halted pumping from the delta for several weeks.
My home county does not, like most of California, depend on snow melt from the Sierras for its water supply.
Nor does it, like most of the remaining regions, rely on water from a river.
Marin - specifically southern and middle Marin - gets its water from seven reservoirs in the hills covering the central region of the county.
These catch run-off from Mt.
Tamalpais and its greater water shed.
But the rising population and the needs of more large houses with expensive landscaping have combined with the acknowledgement of a greater chance of drought to create a need for another source of water .
I've mentioned the option of a desalination plant, sucking water from the San Francisco Bay and filtering it by reverse osmosis.
Now, the talk has escalated to a public environmental impact hearing at the Marin Municipal Water District HQ, where the $115 million first stage plant will be described.
No, there are no funds available for the plant; new taxes and/or higher water bills would raise the money.
And no, there is no firm plan for mitigating damage from the return of concentrated brine to the bay after the pure water is extracted.
Nor is there a plan for generating the electricity required to run the plant, especially in the case of drought, when the plant would need to produce up to twice as much drinking water as during more normal times.
Collecting reports of local climate change impacts and responses from around the world, I'm accumulating a database that can be used for strategic planning by other localities as lessons learned, best practices and valuable contacts.
In early December I blogged about the TVA's power generating capacity being weakened by low water levels due to extreme drought conditions.
They were faced with the Solomon's choice of supplying more water where it was most needed or to save water to produce the normal amount of electric power to the region.
Of course, TVA had to provide people with water.
This meant that, with less water saved behind dams, hydro had less generating capacity, forcing TVA to buy power at higher cost from other sources.
And of course passing costs along to customers.
End result: emergency water was provided and customers will pay more for light and heat next year.
For every location where a new nuclear power plant is being considered, you'd better hope that climate change doesn't land a big drought on you.
And while I'm at it, all those nukes built on th coastlines at sea level to make use of the ocean's voluminous water supply - you'd better hope the sea doesn't rise.
How, I wonder, are those plants assessing risk these days?
Stewart (Whole Earth Catalog) Brand has been promoting nukes as the one renewable and "green" electric power source that can be put online fast enough to allow us to cut loose of coal burning plants in time to avoid the atmospheric carbon tipping point.
I have an inherent fear of nuclear accidents, one of which could kill and dispace so many people - not to mention destroy gobs of infrastructure and whole local economies - that it's hard to see how benefits could be worth the risk.
But these real, climate-determined limits on operability are what adaptation planning is all about.
We won't be functioning under the conditions we're used to.
Climate variability will make many of our assumptions unstable and our solutions temporary.
Adaptation won't be a one-time adjustment ("OK, we'll just replace the roses with cactus and that will be that.
"), it is likely to be an ongoing accomodation to whatever our carbon-soaked atmosphere heaps upon us, in each of our unique local environments.
Driving home from the conference my strong sense was that the PV market right now is where home computers were in the late 1970's and cell phones were in the late 1990's.
It's both gratifying to be a pioneer in this industry having sold the first PV module in America back in 1978 and daunting to see the tidal wave of the solar economy washing up on our shores so quickly.
In the long run it's just what we need if we're to have a chance to mitigate global warming.
Climate Frog is about getting out of the pot before the water gets too hot, but it's also about the joy of getting out of that confinding pot.
Collecting reports of local climate change impacts and responses from around the world, I'm accumulating a database that can be used for strategic planning by other localities as lessons learned, best practices and valuable contacts.
Part of the UN Summit on Climate Change
As an integral part of the Secretary-General's Summit on Climate Change , this luncheon brought together representatives of Governments, Business, Civil Society and the United Nations to discuss how to build positive momentum for climate negotiations and how business can be part of the solution.
Climate change is the defining challenge of our time.
It impacts and threatens every aspect of social and economic life - from energy resources to water sustainability, from food supplies to human security.
No doubt, the time to take action is now.
The UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen this December will be a critical moment in human history.
As governments meet to reach a new climate agreement in Copenhagen, we must do everything in our power to foster the necessary political will in capitals around the world.
The Forum provided a unique opportunity for the private sector to make the case to Heads of State and Government that business has a strong interest in the negotiation of a balanced and effective United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Copenhagen this December.
Such a message from business can instill confidence and foster political will to “Seal the Deal!”
At the Forum, business and civil society demonstrated support for a Copenhagen deal by showing actions already taken to move to a low-carbon economy and making new commitments – individually and in partnership with the UN – to scale up efforts.
Through interactive discussions, leaders identified best corporate practices, exemplary collective action and innovative solutions for climate change mitigation and adaptation, specifically in the areas of: (i) food security; (ii) energy solutions; (iii) water security; (iv) sustainable enterprises and decent work; (v) financing; and (vi) disaster preparedness and risk reduction.
Our CO2 conversations too often focus on one of those three in isolation: Coal bad.
Recycled waste heat good.
Conservation isn't an energy policy .
Each assertion is both narrowly true and broadly incorrect, to the extent that each simplifies three prongs into one.
In a word: competition.
The introduction of competitive access in the 1992 Energy Policy Act (and subsequent FERC rulings) brought forth a flood of natural gas plants, many of which were nearly twice as fuel efficient as the old junk that the grid had previously relied on.
Prior to that point, costs were simply something that you passed along to customers.
After that point -- for much of the grid -- cost control was a route to greater profits.
Not surprisingly, generator owners suddenly got religion on cost-control.
And when your number one cost is fuel, that means they got religion on fuel control.
That's good.
1.
Unintended consequences.
1970 saw the passage of the Clean Air Act , a deeply flawed bill.
It was good in terms of what it did for regulated pollutants, but lousy in terms of what it did for unregulated ones (e.g., CO2).
By effectively mandating pollution control approaches that impose parasitic loads on coal plants, the CAA is directly responsible for lowering coal plant energy efficiency, so that we now burn way more coal per MWh than we did before passage.
We therefore emit way more CO2 per unit of useful electricity.
That's not to ignore the beneficial elements of the CAA, from sulfur to particulate control, but simply to point out that an environmental regulation that encourages energy inefficiency leaves much to be desired.
Here's the tragedy: If we had run the gas fleet at a constant fuel efficiency from 1960-present, we would have emitted an additional 1.3 billion tons of CO2 into the atmosphere.
That's 1.3 billion tons not in the atmosphere today thanks to energy efficiency.
On the other hand ... if we had run the coal fleet at a constant fuel efficiency from 1960-today, we would have emitted nearly 9 billion fewer tons of CO2 into the atmosphere over the last fifty years.
There's not much on the coal side, as all that mandated pollution control drives efficiency down.
So the only way to get it back up is to (a) allow coal plants to go back to 1960's level (non-CO2) pollution levels or (b) overhaul the Clean Air Act.
The first option is environmentally distasteful and the second is - while highly desirable - a political non-starter, at least in the near term.
(As I've noted before , CAA reform is absolutely necessary for legally-coherent GHG policy, and I think it will eventually get done - but I don't see anyone in EPA or elsewhere pushing to do so right away.
)On the gas fleet, the story is a bit more nuanced.
We've brought a lot of combined cycle gas turbines on line that have greatly increased fleet efficiency, and in theory, we ought to be able to continue to do so.
However, there are operational challenges due to the fact that combined cycle gas turbines don't like to turn on and off as quickly as simple cycle gas turbines (e.g., the ones without a steam turbine on the back end capturing the waste heat from the gas turbine on the front end).
In some parts of the country, those high efficiency units can get enough run hours to run anyway, but in many instances, fleet operators are operationally forced to keep their efficient stuff off so that they can run the quick-to-dispatch stuff on the margin.
Note that as load grows (e.g., once the recession ends), we'll be able to run those combined cycle turbines a little more often.
But my guess from looking at the data is that for the foreseeable future, we're unlikely to see much continuing enhancement in the gas fleet.
Note also that the biggest opportunities for generation efficiency are building the generation closer to the load, where the heat can be re-used.
That means stranding a lot of the assets that have driven the trends in the data above, which is a good thing in the long term, and could be done very quickly - but will require a regulatory reform comparable to what we saw after the 1992 EPACT to drive a similar step-function increase in fleet efficiency.

CO2 is NOT a pollutant and it certainly has almost no impact on climate!!!!
This has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
The jig is almost up.
Atmospheric CO2 could triple and we wouldn't even be able to measure its impact on climate.
We have a lot of REAL environmental and energy challenges to deal with.
All the money and time being wasted on trying to reduce CO2 could have been spent on other serious issues like hypoxia, invasive species, mercury, stormwater runoff etc.
The only thing that trying to cap CO2 has done is hurt the environment by promoting horrible government-subsidized solutions such as ethanol... which is a lousy fuel, causes more real pollution to be emitted, wastes water and land, and drives food prices up.
It would be great if windmills and solar panels were workable solutions, but they are not, at least on a large scale.
If we want to be taken seriously on the real issues, we need to come up with real, economical solutions to actual environmental problems, otherwise, we risk loosing credibility to the point where we will be marginalized beyond repair.
For example, it is not credible to decry CO2 on the one hand, and then denounce nuclear on the other.
Even if ya don't believe CO2 is responsible for global warming, it is a universal fact that CO2 is acidic (a simple pH test can confirm this).Increases in CO2 lead to increasingly acidic water and soil.Therefore, CO2 is a pollutant.
Ummmm....three things?
Looks to me like maybe 2-1/2:1.
Switch fuels.2.
Use less energy by being efficient.3.
Use less energy period.So let's shut off some of those inefficient coal plants that even investors don't like and solve both the CO2 problem AND the other pollution problems.This article is flawed mainly by its use of "intensivity.
" What solves any of these problems is a reduction of the total production of the named pollutants, not a calculation that stays the same if the trouble doubles.
Hello, Expert Reviewers of the Climate Change Science Program Synthesis and Assessment Product 4.1 - As you may know, the report you reviewed for us in the Fall of 2007, Coastal Sensitivity to Sea-Level Rise: A Focus on the Mid-Atlantic Region, was released on January 16, 2009.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, in collaboration with other agencies, has released a report that discusses the impacts of sea level rise on the coast, coastal communities, and the habitats and species that depend on them.
The report, Coastal Sensitivity to Sea-Level Rise: A Focus on the Mid-Atlantic Region, examines multiple opportunities for governments and coastal communities to plan for and adapt to rising sea levels.
Sea-level rise can affect coastal communities and habitats in a variety of different ways, including submerging low-lying lands, eroding beaches, converting wetlands to open water, intensifying coastal flooding, and increasing the salinity of estuaries and freshwater aquifers.
It is caused by a number of natural and human-induced factors and can vary by region.
Some impacts of sea-level rise can already be observed along the U.S. coast.
The primary causes of global sea-level rise are the expansion of ocean water due to warming and the melting of glaciers and ice sheets.
EPA led the development of the report with significant contributions from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Geological Survey.
The report is one of 21 climate change synthesis and assessment products commissioned by the U.S. Climate Change Science Program (CCSP).
CCSP was established in 2002 to provide the U.S. with science-based knowledge to manage the risks and opportunities of change in the climate and related environmental systems.
The program is responsible for coordinating and integrating the research of 13 federal agencies on climate and global change.
... the Environmental Economics blog ... is now the default homepage on my browser (but then again, I guess I am a wonk -- a word I learned on the E.E.
blog). That is a very nice service to the profession.
José Manuel Barroso , President of the European Commission, has been a leading proponent of strong action against climate change, not only in the 27-nation European Union, but globally.
The EU has been in the vanguard, particularly when the executive branch of the US was for eight years a captive to special interests and a politics of regression in most things.
“ Europe has passed its credibility test ,” Barroso said last December.
With Copenhagen looming in just 15 days, and with the eyes of the world already focused on what can be expected to happen - and what should happen - it is not without purpose to hearken back to an article written by President Barroso in September: Edge back from the abyss - It’s time to deliver on climate change .
The EU has already committed to a 20% reduction in GHG emissions from 1990 levels by 2020 (along with a 20% share for renewable energy, and a 20% boost to energy efficiency) - and they say they’ll produce a 30% reduction in GHG if others make a similar commitment.
“The University of East Anglia’s Hadley Climatic Research Centre appears to have suffered a security breach earlier today, when an unknown hacker apparently downloaded 1079 e-mails and 72 documents of various types and published them to an anonymous FTP server.
These files appear to contain highly sensitive information that, if genuine, could prove extremely embarrassing to the authors of the e-mails involved.
Those authors include some of the most celebrated names among proponents of the theory of anthropogenic global warming (AGW).”
I teach climate change and international relations so on with my professor’s hat.
It’s time for a quiz.
The National Academies of Science of over a dozen countries are deeply concerned about manmade greenhouse gases and global warming because:
The Pope, the Dalai Lama, Rick Warren, the Evangelical Climate Initiative and other religious leaders are concerned and active on the climate crisis because
(d) they know that climate change is real, it’s anthropogenically produced, it has and will have devastating impacts, it’s critical to reduce greenhouse gases sooner rather than later (and by 80% by 2050), and they know that a low-carbon world will be safer and better for their bottom lines
it is widely known that Michael Mann and Phil Jones are two of the worlds leading climate “scientists”.
It was their work that produced the now infamous “hockey stick” graph that was all the rage in 1998 and lead to the Kyoto Protocols.
It was also their work that was highly touted in the IPCC AR 4 that suggested alarming outcomes in the next 50 years.
NJCONS - You certainly are committed.
(There’s a pun there, but I won’t pursue it.
) I don’t know how you say 10% of the world’s nations.
Nearly 200 of the (nearly 200) nations of the world are parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change .
Almost all of these are signatories to the Kyoto Protocol .
I said “The National Academies of Science of over a dozen countries…” These are from major world powers.
And yes, I think Honduras cares quite a lot about climate change as they’ve been badly hammered by the more intense tropical storms that are a result of the higher sea-surface temperatures that have been measured, remeasured, verified and measured again.
As to my alleged lack of concern over scientific discipline and integrity, that’s a bit of a hoot.
Actually Hondurans, along with the rest of the planet have enjoyed relatively mild hurricane seasons for quite some time.
“Global hurricane activity has decreased to the lowest level in 30 years.”
“In fact, 80 percent to 90 percent of global warming involves heating up ocean waters.
They hold much more heat than the atmosphere can.
So Willis has been studying the ocean with a fleet of robotic instruments called the Argo system.
The buoys can dive 3,000 feet down and measure ocean temperature.
Since the system was fully deployed in 2003, it has recorded no warming of the global oceans.”
The “Financial Times” - can we stipulate that they’re not a pack of thieves?
- have this editorial today on the subject.
Here’s what I think is the heart of the matter: “The most important point to make about the leaked correspondence is that it does not undermine the scientific case for cutting emissions of carbon dioxide to fight climate change, which is growing more rather than less compelling.
None of the e-mails seized on by sceptics shows manipulation of the science itself.”
It’s no use pretending that this isn’t a major blow.
The emails extracted by a hacker from the climatic research unit at the University of East Anglia could scarcely be more damaging(1).
I am now convinced that they are genuine, and I’m dismayed and deeply shaken by them.
Worse still, some of the emails suggest efforts to prevent the publication of work by climate sceptics(5,6), or to keep it out of a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(7).
I believe that the head of the unit, Phil Jones, should now resign.
Some of the data discussed in the emails should be re-analysed.
“…peer reviewing…”!
You’re really showing your lack of basic reason to have the audacity to accuse these climate scientists of avoiding peer review.
Because some nonentity like Steve McIntyre is on a self-anointed crusade to disrupt the work of real scientists - doing real work - by filing hundreds of FOIL requests for information does not constitute these scientists avoiding peer review.
Peer review means submitting your work to, well, peers - scientists who have qualifications, and who work to review work in an orderly, time-honored tradition, with rigorous protocols.
Listen, if anyone cares at this point about this topic - the tempest in a teapot over arguably “bad behavior” by some climate scientists who, at the end of the day, have been doing important work, you might like to see one of my favorite writers these days, Andrew Leonard at salon.com , and his posts, this one in particular which I think is informative - and the inevitable slew of comments, some of which NJcons and I have produced for you here in microcosm.
The latest NOAA Climate Assessment Report indicated that if the 10+ year trend of no warming continues into 2014, that GCMs would be falsified at a 95% level of significance and the notion that CO2 is the primary cause of a warming planet would be disproven.
Here we go again?
I would guess that the good folks at NOAA would challenge your assertion.
Their report indicates nothing but further and deeper impacts for the future.
No warming?
Not really.
Here is some climate science.
Carbon dioxide is responsible for 43% of warming.
See this .
We can place this apparent lack of warming in the context of natural climate fluctuations other than ENSO using twenty-first century simulations with the HadCM3 climate model (Gordon et al.
2000), which is typical of those used in the recent IPCC report (AR4; Solomon et al.
2007). Ensembles with different modifications to the physical parameters of the model (within known uncertainties) (Collins et al.
2006) are performed for several of the IPCC SRES emissions scenarios (Solomon et al.
2007). Ten of these simulations have a steady long-term rate of warming between 0.15° and 0.25ºC decade–1, close to the expected rate of 0.2ºC decade–1.
ENSO-adjusted warming in the three surface temperature datasets over the last 2–25 yr continually lies within the 90% range of all similar-length ENSO-adjusted temperature changes in these simulations (Fig.
2.8b).
Near-zero and even negative trends are common for intervals of a decade or less in the simulations, due to the model’s internal climate variability.
The simulations rule out (at the 95% level) zero trends for intervals of 15 yr or more, suggesting that an observed absence of warming of this duration is needed to create a discrepancy with the expected present-day warming rate.
all that’s left is a handful of completely unreliable climate models….
Kid - Your first note on this referenced a NOAA report.
What you are really referring to here is a report from the UK’s Met Office Hadley Centre.
The press release from them on this quotes Vicky Pope, Head of Climate Change Advice at the Met Office: “Decades like 1999–2008 occur quite frequently in our climate change simulations, but the underlying trend of increasing temperature remains.
We cannot be complacent.
Indeed, other signals of climate change are increasing as fast, or even faster than ever due to the combined effects of global warming and natural variability — the rapid loss of summer Arctic sea ice is one such example.
Early action to reduce the extent and impacts of climate change remains vital.” The two-pager that you referenced - and thanks for giving us the complete information here - says, quite clearly: “The simulations also produce an average increase of 2.0°C in twenty-first century global temperature, demonstrating that recent observational trends are not sufficient to discount predictions of substantial climate change and its significant and widespread impacts.”
I appreciate your civil approach in offering what you seem to think is science that does not show warming but, at the end of the day, the work you’ve referenced - as does all the work that I’ve cited here, from a dozen National Academies of Science, to thousands of peer-reviewed journal articles, to the work over 20 years of the IPCC, shows the unequivocal baleful influence of manmade greenhouse gases on our climate system.
I really have enjoyed the exchange and apologize for the clumsy style of my initial 2 posts.
I do understand and accept the theory of AGW.
I have done research (medical and nutrition) and I have an engineering background with some experience in modeling, plus I have the luxury of having a relative that writes code for climate models.
It is because of this background that I understand that science requires an open mind and measurable parameters of falsification for models.
Every scientist who models understands this.
As you noted the MET study says, “The simulations also produce an average increase of 2.0°C in twenty-first century global temperature, demonstrating that recent observational trends are not sufficient to discount predictions of substantial climate change and its significant and widespread impacts.”
“Near-zero and even negative trends are common for intervals of a decade or less in the simulations, due to the model’s internal climate variability.
The simulations rule out (at the 95% level) zero trends for intervals of 15 yr or more, suggesting that an observed absence of warming of this duration is needed to create a discrepancy with the expected present-day warming rate.”
I simply meant to inform you that climate scientists at the MET Office have now set the parameter for falsification of the IPCC models at a 15 year trend of no warming.
This doesn’t mean it hasn’t been warming in the past or that it won’t warm in the future, it just means that the 2C degree GMST predicted by 2100 by the models, would be too high.
This is a very good thing as it acts as a quality control measure in assuring that future predictions are based on accurate models so that policy wonks can make informed decisions.
The evidence…as presented by the climate scientists themselves show global cooling over the past decade and not a single model even allowed for such a possibility…
Njcons - Joe Romm, who “Time Magazine,” another one of those left-wing publications without integrity, calls the “web’s most influential climate blogger,” had this post recently.
But then I have little doubt that you consider Romm to be part of this vast conspiracy and therefore any information he cites from NASA must be disallowed.
Hey, now that I think of it: NASA!
Aren’t they the ones who faked the moon landings too?
Kid - The item from Joe Romm references the influence of El Nino.
Remember though, that I am but a humble political scientist and environmentalist.
For the seriously heavy science, you will be much better enlightened at RealClimate, Climate Feedback, and a host of other sites, including Better Nature which has the item we’re discussing here.
And yes, Davies is taking El Nino into account.
“When scientists talk about climate change, they are not talking about year-by-year fluctuations, because many factors cause short-term fluctuations.
Rather, they are talking about longer-term trends.
“
The Met Office plans to re-examine 160 years of temperature data after admitting that public confidence in the science on man-made global warming has been shattered by leaked e-mails.
As to the politics of “The Times,” it’s owned by News Corporation.
Rupert Murdoch is the CEO.
Murdoch also owns the “Wall St. Journal” and Fox.
Both the Journal and Fox are famously opposed to all attempts to promote clean energy and to combat climate change.
So you can extrapolate the politics of The Times.
By the way, the article you reference further asserts that “…public confidence in the science on man-made global warming has been shattered…” My latest post belies this peculiarly subjective conclusion from a journalist.
Failing Journalism 101 here.
Storm World author Chris Mooney recently appeared on The Discovery Channel's Discovery News to discuss hurricanes.
“Journalist Mooney has a scriptwriter’s flair for pitting his protagonists against each other and dishing the historical and methodological back story in vivid prose ... Mooney presents an accurate account of the clash between two of the most prominent climate scientists today.
He is a good writer.
. .
and his stories are consistently about people, giving the book a wide appeal.
"
".
. .
Mooney has written a straightforward and very serviceable account of the study of hurricanes and whether their intensity, frequency or other characteristics are changing due to global warming.
. .
Storm World is an entertaining and accurate account of research in progress — warts and all.
"
"Storm World has everything a non-expert would want from a book on hurricane science.
. .
It's not hard to read between the lines and see how hard Mooney was working to remain apolitical, but the book succeeds because he does.
"
"Enter the talented science journalist Chris Mooney with Storm World, which skillfully anatomizes the scientific and political debate over hurricanes and global warming.
. .
. Storm World does a good job explaining the fundamentals of hurricane science and the ways different scientists approach it.
"
Salon's Katharine Mieszkowski talks with Chris Mooney about the scientific debates surrounding climate change:
"Science writer Chris Mooney grew up in New Orleans.
Just 100 days before Hurricane Katrina made landfall in Louisiana, he sounded the alarm in the pages of the American Prospect about the Big Easy's extreme vulnerability to a major storm.
Katrina even swamped his own mother's home in the Lakeview neighborhood.
But you won't find Mooney... joining the chorus blaming the devastation and deaths in New Orleans on climate change.
"
The Tampa Tribune's Kurt Loft discusses Chris Mooney's Storm World, his tour, and more specifically why hurricane science is relevant to the city:
Mooney provides a fine overview of the long, intertwined history of hurricane prediction, climate science and the politicization of the debate over global warming.... To boil this down to a debate between theorists and empiricists is to oversimplify, of course, and Mooney does justice to the debate in all its complexity, painting vivid portraits of scientists at work and in conflict.
Internet climate destination RealClimate.org 's in depth review of Chris Mooney's Storm World has sparked a lot of conversation (121 comments and 11 blog reactions):
There should be no misunderstanding.
While Mooney is indeed balanced, he is not completely agnostic either.
He recognizes that hurricane characteristics are indeed changing and that, while we may not yet have arrived at definitive answers to the underlying scientific questions, we ought to be concerned.
Chris Mooney was recently a guest on CBC Radio's Quirks & Quarks show to talk about the science of predicting hurricanes in a changing environment.
Mooney, whose The Republican War on Science (2005) offered a hard-hitting look at the political manipulation of scientific research, turns his attention to the hot topic of global warming.... [He] looks carefully at all sides of the debate, weighing the evidence carefully, telling us not just what’s being said but who’s saying it and why... but... doesn’t get bogged down in the politics.... This is certainly one of the most thought-provoking and accessible accounts of climate change to appear since Katrina.
Chris Mooney will be traveling through the heart of hurricane valley and back!
Mooney's tour starts on July 11 and includes stops in ten cities.
He will also be take part in an upcoming radio satellite tour on June 10!

The Climate Modeling and Diagnostics Laboratory is a NOAA agency dedicated to researching processes that may force climate change or harm the ozone layer.
CMDL also oversees a network of laboratories monitoring solar and terrestrial radiation and greenhouse and trace gases.
This review prepared by experts at the Munich Re Group reports on the natural disasters of the year 2001 and the inordinate strain it placed on the insurance industry.
It includes two supplements: a world map of natural catastrophes 2002 and a poster of natural catastrophes 2002.
NOAA's Aeronomy Laboratory, which is dedicated "to improve the capability to observe, understand, predict, and protect the quality of the atmosphere," investigates the effects chemical processes, especially ozone depletion in the stratosphere and ozone production in the troposphere, have on earth's climate.
CSIRO, an Australian research center, is concerned with the effects of climate change on the tropics, including the ramifications of ENSO and monsoon variability, on Australia and the world.
The Atmospheric Research Division addresses topics such as urban and regional air pollution, acid deposition, the enhanced greenhouse effect, ozone depletion, climatic variability and severe weather.
Most of the potentially damaging consequences relating to climate change are associated with extremes- the number of heat waves, floods, or severe storms, for example.
Since extreme weather events cause loss of life and property, it is important to understand what impact climate change may have on their occurrence.
Global climate change affects different regions of the earth in different ways.
Although the accuracy of regional climate forecasts is improving, they are still uncertain.
However, we do know that a warmer atmosphere will result in a greater number of tropical storms, extreme heat waves, droughts, and floods.
Since 1970, tropical cyclone activity has increased in the North Atlantic ( 1 ).
Activity is measured not only by the frequency and number of storms that develop, but also by their intensity and duration (collectively named the Power Dissipation Index).
A marked increase in the PDI began around 1970, though a less-defined (but still substantial) increase began in the early 1950’s.
With regards to actual numbers of tropical storms, an analysis published by the U.S. Climate Change Science Program identified three distinct periods in the 20th century in which the average number of tropical storms increased and then continued to remain at the elevated level.
Beginning in 1900 and lasting until around 1930, there was an average of six tropical cyclones (four hurricanes and two tropical storms) per year in the Atlantic basin.
During the 1930’s and early 1940’s, however, the average number of annual cyclones increased to 10 (five hurricanes and 5 tropical storms).
These frequencies remained relatively stable (never decreasing to their pre-1930’s levels, but also never increasing) until close to the end of the century.
But in the ten years between 1995 and 2005, the average number per year grew to 15- eight hurricanes and seven tropical storms.
In other words, on average there were more storms classified as hurricanes (eight) at the end of the century than the average total number of storms (six) per year at the beginning of the century ( 2 ).
Tropical storm formation relies upon a variety of different meteorological conditions.
First, local sea surface temperatures must be around 26.5 °C (80 °F).
When evaporation occurs from warm surface waters, it creates high humidity in the atmosphere.
High humidity then leads to thunderstorm development and if multiple thunderstorm systems converge, a tropical depression (a storm with a vortex and rotation) is formed.
The newly created vortex draws in additional heat from the surface of the ocean and releases it into the atmosphere in the form of rainfall as the water vapor condenses.
Simultaneously, high winds are created from the energy being released by the heat of the ocean.
The more heat available at the surface, the higher the potential winds may be.
Once wind speeds exceed 35 mph, the system becomes a tropical storm and is assigned a name ( 3 ).
While analyzing the number of tropical storms each year is a fairly simple way of noting changes over time, various studies have identified how the strength of the storms has changed as well.
A 2005 study published in the journal Nature examined the duration and maximum wind speeds of each tropical cyclone that formed over the last 30 years and found that their destructive power has increased around 70 percent in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans ( 4 ).
Another 2005 study, published in the journal Science, revealed that the percentage of hurricanes classified as Category 4 or 5 (the two strongest categories on the Saffir-Simpson scale) has increased over the same period ( 5 ).
It is important to consider that two of the driving forces behind hurricane formation (sea surface temperatures and humidity levels) have been influenced by climate change.
There has been a measurable increase (about 1.3 degrees in the past 100 years) in sea surface temperatures in regions where tropical cyclones typically originate.
Also, the sharpest increases in SSTs took place in the years prior to the changes in storm frequency, with an SST rise of approximately 0.7 degrees Fahrenheit leading up to 1930 and a similar rise leading up to 1995 and continuing even after.
( 2 ).
Air humidity has also increased in recent history; about 4% since 1970 ( 1 ).
Increases in both of these factors lead to conditions more conducive to tropical storm development.
In the future, it is likely that tropical storm intensity will continue to strengthen.
Model simulations suggest that wind speeds will increase by 1 to 8% and rainfall rates will increase by 6 to 18% for every 1°C rise in sea surface temperatures ( 6 ).
Therefore, as climate change leads to progressively warmer ocean temperatures, tropical storm intensity will increase as well.
While they might be some of the largest and most damaging, tropical storms are not the only types of extreme weather influenced by climate change.
Another likely consequence of an overall warmer atmosphere includes greater numbers of heat waves and fewer periods of extreme cold.
This is because the excess emissions of greenhouse gases by humans results in both warmer temperatures and a greater variability in the weather, which can lead to extremes.
The climatological record of the past several decades offers evidence for these trends.
While most recent winters in North America and Asia have been milder than average, a number of countries have experienced record summer heat ( 1 ).
A heat wave in May of 2002 claimed over 600 lives in India as temperatures soared to 122° F (50° C).
The summer of 2003 saw one of the highest weather-related death tolls in European history as 52,000 people died as a result of heat extremes ( 8 ).
However, the periods of extreme heat do not necessarily mean that in the winter, snowfall amounts will be reduced.
Warmer air is capable of holding more moisture- so a generally warmer atmosphere will hold more precipitation, even in the winter.
As with heat waves, the frequency of such events are generally decreasing, but their intensity is increasing (as shown by the devastating blizzards in February 2010 in the mid-Atlantic region) ( 7 ).
While it is impossible to blame any one extreme weather event on climate change, these recent trends indicate that longer and more intense heat waves will occur in the future ( 8 ).
According to the WMO, though these severe heat waves are likely to be found all over the world in the coming century, places in the western U.S., northern Africa, central Asia, southern Africa, and Australia are especially vulnerable ( 9 ).
One of the physical consequences of a warmer atmosphere is an increased capacity to hold moisture.
According to the Clausius-Clapeyron relation, the amount of water vapor that can be stored in the atmosphere increases rapidly with temperature.
A warmer planet is also most likely a wetter planet, as more evaporation can occur ( 11 ).
An increase in the frequency or intensity of floods would be catastrophic in many low-lying places around the world.
Asian countries are particularly at risk, as low-lying areas (like river deltas and small islands) are densely populated.
In Bangladesh alone, over 17 million people live at an elevation of less than 3 ft (1 m) above sea level, and millions more inhabit the flat banks of the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers ( 1 ).
Another consideration is that poorer countries like Bangladesh do not have the financial resources to relocate their citizens to lower risk areas- nor are they able to create protective barriers ( 12 ).
And while an obvious impact of flooding is its ability to displace millions of people, there is also the problem of maintaining a clean water supply.
Floodwaters can contaminate drinking water, and sea level rise can lead to the contamination of private wells, leading to catastrophic results ( 13 ).
The possibility for major flooding events is not just limited to Asian countries.
The Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (which is an international organization) recently announced the 10 cities most vulnerable to flooding.
Six of the 10 are in Asia: Mumbai, Shanghai, Ho Chi Minh City, Calcutta, Osaka, and Guangzhou.
The other four, however, are in the United States: New York City, Miami, Alexandria, and New Orleans.
All are coastal, low-lying, and densely populated ( 12 ).
While flooding is generally considered to be of greater concern for poorer, developing countries, wealthier locations face their own set of problems.
In the U.S., for example, waterfront real estate is highly desirable.
Wetlands and coastal areas like barrier islands help protect the mainland from flooding and storm surges by acting as a buffer.
As more building occurs in these areas, this natural buffer disappears, leaving the homes and businesses at risk.
As long as people continue to build in these at-risk areas, flooding will continue to be a major problem ( 12 ).
While average global rainfall is predicted to increase with climate change, not every location on the planet would experience greater rainfall.
Evaporation and precipitation occur at different places, and while wet regions could receive even more rainfall if the planet warms, drier regions may experience even more acute shortages of water as evaporation is accelerated in those areas ( 1 ).
The Sahel, for example, has become drier over the past several decades, accelerating desertification and placing an even greater premium on already-stretched water supplies.
According to the WMO, the western United States and Mexico, the Mediterranean basin, northern China, Southern Africa, Australia, and parts of South America are other regions highly likely to experience harsh drought conditions in the future ( 9 ).
As research continues into the effects of global climate change on extreme weather, it is important to consider the human and economic toll of extreme weather events.
A potential increase in frequency or intensity of these events is another strong reason why we must take action to counteract global climate change.

A Report by the U.S. Climate Change Science Program and the Subcommittee on Global Change Research.

Solar radiation, temperature, and precipitation are the main drivers of crop growth; therefore agriculture has always been highly dependent on climate patterns and variations.
Since the industrial revolution, humans have been changing the global climate by emitting high amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, resulting in higher global temperatures, affecting hydrological regimes and increasing climatic variability.
Climate change is projected to have significant impacts on agricultural conditions, food supply, and food security.
Overall, climate change could result in a variety of impacts on agriculture.
Some of these effects are biophysical, some are ecological, and some are economic, including:
A shift in climate and agricultural zones towards the poles
A boost in agricultural productivity due to increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
However, agriculture is itself responsible for an estimated one third of climate change.
It is generally agreed that about 25% of carbon dioxide emissions, are produced by agricultural sources, mainly deforestation, the use of fossil fuel-based fertilizers, and the burning of biomass.
Most of the methane in the atmosphere comes from domestic ruminants, forest fires, wetland rice cultivation and waste products, while conventional tillage and fertilizer use account for 70% of the nitrous oxides.
According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the three main causes of the increase in greenhouse gases observed over the past 250 years have been fossil fuels, land use, and agriculture.
Over the past centuries, human ingenuity has led to technological advances in agriculture that have allowed substantial increase in crop yields, in part stimulated to meet population growth.
Intensive agricultural methods are reported to have detrimental effects on the environment.
CO2 emissions linked to deforestation in temperate regions: where forests and woodlands are cleared to make room for fields and pastures.
Together, these agricultural processes comprise 54% of methane emissions, roughly 80% of nitrous oxide emissions, and virtually all carbon dioxide emissions tied to land use.
Deforestation for land cleaning purposes also affects regional carbon reuptake, which can result in increased concentrations of CO2, the dominant greenhouse gas.
Worldwide, livestock production occupies 70% of all land used for agriculture, or 30% of the land surface of the Earth.
The Climate Institute is working to increase global awareness of the warming influence of gases and aerosols with short atmospheric lifetimes, including black carbon, methane, and tropospheric ozone.
Specifically, the Climate Institute seeks to highlight the opportunity to limit near-term climate change by aggressively targeting short-lived gases and aerosols.
As part of this effort, the Climate Institute is analyzing various technologies and policies that can effectively reduce short-lived warming agents in different parts of the world.
Information is disseminated through stakeholder meetings, publications, editorials, briefings, and the Tickell Interactive Network.
Through these efforts, the Climate Institute hopes to make individuals at all levels more knowledgeable about the important contribution to global warming due to short-lived gases and aerosols, and about the methods available to reduce emissions of these species in order to reduce the increasing pace of near-term climate change.
To most effectively limit near- and long-term climate change, national and international climate mitigation strategies must target the full range of greenhouse gases and warming particles.
Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions during the 21st century are projected to be responsible for roughly half of the warming influence from greenhouse gas emissions during the 21st century.
Therefore, mitigation efforts solely focused on CO2 will be inadequate to reverse or even substantially slow the global warming trend within this century.
Because unabated warming over this century will likely send the Earth’s climate past several impact thresholds, it is thus vital to also be controlling emissions of the non-CO2 greenhouse gases, and particularly those with short lifetimes.
Because of the multi-century lifetime of CO2, however, its mitigation also remains absolutely critical to slowing climate change and averting worst case climate scenarios.
To complement the CO2 effort that will limit long-term warming, emissions of species with shorter atmospheric lifetimes than CO2 must be reduced to suppress near-term warming.
Short-lived warming agents are responsible for most of the warming caused by non-CO2 emissions.
Substantially reducing these emissions will lower their atmospheric concentrations over periods of months to decades and will relatively rapidly limit the warming influences that are causing the ongoing rising of the global average temperature.
The rate of relief that can be achieved varies between species.
The methane perturbation caused by emissions lasts on average for roughly a decade.
Black carbon (often referred to as soot) and tropospheric ozone (formed in the atmosphere from carbon monoxide, nitrous oxides and volatile organic compounds) persist in the atmosphere for only a few weeks.
Black carbon reductions will also curb the soot deposits on snow and ice that greatly increase rates of melting.
Targeting black carbon is also a public health measure; breathing in the particulate matter is known to cause several million deaths each year from indoor and outdoor exposure.

To generate electricity, coal is usually pulverized and burned in a furnace with a boiler.
The furnace heat converts boiler water to steam, which is then used to spin turbines which turn generators and create electricity.
Upon combustion, coal produces a number of gaseous byproducts, including greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, and methane gas.
Burning coal also produces emissions, such as sulfur, nitrogen oxide (NOx), and mercury, that can pollute the air and water.
Sulfur mixes with oxygen to form sulfur dioxide (SO2), a chemical that can affect trees and water when it combines with moisture to produce acid rain.
Emissions of nitrogen oxide help create smog, and also contribute to acid rain.
Mercury that is released into the air eventually settles in water.
The mercury in the water can build up in fish and shellfish, and can be harmful to animals and people who eat them.
Of the fossil fuels, coal burning plants produce the most carbon dioxide per unit of energy generated.
Coal and fuel oil combustion emit fly ash particles into the atmosphere, which contribute to air pollution problems.
There is an urgent need to adopt a change in technology within the next 15 to 20 years, as the majority of coal fired power plants that are in generation today rely upon technology that is 50-100 years old releasing high level of carbon dioxide emissions responsible for global warming.
“Carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired electricity generation comprise nearly 80 percent of the total CO2 emissions produced by the generation of electricity in the United States.
Coal combustion currently accounts for 36% of total carbon dioxide emissions in the United States.
It is also projected that by the year 2027, total carbon dioxide emissions will increase to 21.4 tons per person which equates to an 8% increase from 2007 emissions.
Additionally, according to the United Nations statistics division, in 2003 the United States emitted approximately 24.3% of the total world carbon dioxide emission, with a projection of approximately 20% of the world total by the year 2030.
With the forecasted increase in coal use, carbon emissions due to coal will comprise an even larger majority of total emissions by the year 2030.
In 1999, carbon dioxide emissions from coal equated to approximately 1.8 million thousand metric tons.
Additionally, coal fired generation has the highest CO2 emission rate of the greenhouse gases (2,249 lbs/MWh).
The coal industry has found several ways to reduce sulfur, nitrogen oxides, and other impurities from coal.
They have found more effective ways of cleaning coal before it leaves the mine, and coal companies look for low-sulfur coal to mine.
Power plants use "scrubbers" to clean sulfur from the smoke before it leaves their smokestacks.
In addition, industry and government have cooperated to develop "clean coal technologies" that either remove sulfur and nitrogen oxides from coal, or convert coal to a gas or liquid fuel.
Clean coal technologies helped make it possible for U.S. utilities to meet more stringent Clean Air Act requirements for industries to reduce pollutants released into the air and the water.
New programs in clean coal technology—such as the Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI) – are essential for building on the progress of the original Clean Coal Technology Program, finding solutions for reducing trace emissions of mercury; reducing or eliminating carbon dioxide emissions; and increasing fuel efficiencies.
The Clean Coal Power Initiative is a cooperative, cost-shared program between the government and industry which will demonstrate advanced coal-based power generation technologies including carbon capture and storage.

Changes in climate that have already taken place are manifested in the decrease in extent and thickness of Arctic sea ice, permafrost thawing, coastal erosion, changes in ice sheets and ice shelves, and altered distribution and abundance of species.
Nowadays snows melt earlier in the springtime.
Lakes, rivers and bogs freeze much later in the autumn.
Reindeer herding become more difficult as the ice is weak and may give way… Nowadays the winters are much warmer than they used to be.
Occasionally during winter time it rains.
We never expected this; we could not be ready for this.
It is very strange… The cycle of the yearly calendar has been disturbed greatly and this affects the reindeer herding negatively for sure…
These results and many more are a result of the Arctic Climate Impacts Assessment (ACIA), the results of which were first presented publicly at an international scientific symposium held from 9-12 November in Reykjavik, Iceland.
ACIA was conducted under the auspices of the Arctic Council and its Arctic Science Committee.
The Council was created by international treaty and has as its members Canada, Finland, Iceland, Denmark/ Greenland/Faroe Islands, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the United States, as well as six Indigenous People’ Organizations representing the Aleut, Athabaskan, Gwich’in, Saami, and other indigenous peoples of the Arctic.
While the major focus of the assessment is on the potential impacts of future changes in climate, the ACIA began with an analysis of how the present climate is changing.
Warming over northern land areas, particularly Siberia and northwestern North America has been much greater than elsewhere in the world, and this is to be expected given the melting back of snow and ice cover that is amplifying the warming in these regions.
The changes are compatible with model simulations of changes due to human modification of the concentration of greenhouse gases during the 20th century, leading quite directly to the projections that the Arctic will warm by several times as much during the 21st century as it did during the 20th century.
The amplified warming in the Arctic, in turn, directly contributes to overall global warming, as well as causing changes in the Arctic that create impacts over the rest of the globe; accelerated sea level rise due to melting of mountain glaciers and ice sheets being the most important example.
Thus, not only the people of the Arctic have an interest in what is happening there.
The results of five climate models were drawn upon to derive projections of future climatic change.
Each model was run using two emissions scenarios, one near the mid-range of IPCC estimates, and one indicating somewhat lower than average emissions.
That these relatively modest emissions scenarios caused the Arctic to warm by roughly 3 to 6ºC over the 21st century indicates why there is so much concern about human-induced warming in this region.
Relying on these scenarios of plausible change, ACIA’s team evaluated what the projected warming would mean for the region.
The analyses indicate that the natural environment will be very strongly impacted, with substantial shifts in vegetation zones that cause significant reduction of tundra regions where many birds go for summer breeding.
As permafrost melts and these vegetation shifts occur, forest ecosystems will be particularly vulnerable to fire and pests.
Wildlife will also be significantly affected, especially those animals like the polar bear and walrus that depend on sea ice reaching near land at various times during the year and caribou that depend on frozen rivers and open tundra regions in the course of their annual migrations.
Marine fisheries will also be altered, for many depend on events going on at the edge of the sea ice.
People in the Arctic are also likely to experience serious impacts.
Many indigenous communities were located along the coast so they could hunt for food on land and sea ice as well as from the open waters.
Not only will their harvesting of food be hindered as wildlife populations are affected, but the retreating sea ice is already starting to expose their coastal communities to greater erosion from winter storms and higher sea levels; already a few long-established villages are having to plan very expensive relocations.
As the environment of the Indigenous Peoples of the Arctic changes, their cultural heritage is threatened, with the extensive natural knowledge that has been developed over many generations no longer being useful or valid.
Shifting to a social structure based on products brought in from afar and sold rather than gathered has the potential to seriously disrupt the community’s internal and external relationships and rich and wonderful traditions of all helping each other to gather the means to survive through the long polar nights.
Practices and identities developed over many centuries may well be lost as irrelevant and impractical to a warmer world.
While it would seem that the longer duration of open water could bring many benefits, great care will need to be taken as a result of the floating ice that could catch ships in its grasp, or even cause damage to ships and thereby lead to pollution of this pristine, and slow-healing, environment.
In addition, although ocean transportation will become easier, land transportation will become more difficult as permafrost melts and the soils stay frozen for shorter and shorter periods each year.
Thus, while there is likely to be increased access to coastal areas, moving resources over land to ships may well become more problematic.
The thawing of the permafrost is also going to destabilize buildings and other infrastructure such as roads, airports, sewage systems, pipelines, and industrial facilities.
Future development is going to require new design elements to account for the changes, thereby increasing construction costs.
Thawing permafrost also has the potential for diverting water courses and changing the water table, affecting both ecosystems and water resource infrastructure.
While warming is of utmost concern, there are actually multiple influences affecting the region.
Reduced concentrations of stratospheric ozone are likely to persist for several decades, increasing levels of UV radiation for vulnerable species in the spring and also increasing exposure to humans, who will be outside more with warmer conditions.
The Arctic is also experiencing increased levels of mercury and other toxic contaminants that can work through the food chain, affecting various species and eventually humans.
That warming is already so far along that it is causing noticeable impacts makes it clear that continuing onward with no serious international program to limit emissions will lead to warming that will transform the Arctic into a completely unfamiliar place for many plants and animals, leading to at least local extinctions and an on-going situation of relatively rapid changes that do not allow time for many Arctic species to adapt.
For those of us in the rest of the world, the significance and difficulty of dealing with rapid changes in climate should be a lesson that we must alter the carbon-based energy path that we are on—and soon.
4.1 Mitigation through Terrestrial Ecosystem and Land Management
Forests, agricultural lands, and other terrestrial ecosystems offer significant, if often temporary, mitigation potential.
Conservation and sequestration allow time for other options to be further developed and implemented.
The IPCC SAR estimated that about 60 to 87GtC could be conserved or sequestered in forests by the year 2050 and another 23 to 44GtC could be sequestered in agricultural soils.
The current assessment of the potential of biological mitigation options is in the order of 100GtC (cumulative) by 2050, equivalent to about 10% to 20% of projected fossil fuel emissions during that period.
In this section, biological mitigation measures in terrestrial ecosystems are assessed, focusing on the mitigation potential, ecological and environmental constraints, economics, and social considerations.
Also, briefly, the so-called geo-engineering options are discussed.
Increased carbon pools through the management of terrestrial ecosystems can only partially offset fossil fuel emissions.
Moreover, larger C stocks may pose a risk for higher CO
emissions in the future, if the C-conserving practices are discontinued.
For example, abandoning fire control in forests, or reverting to intensive tillage in agriculture may result in a rapid loss of at least part of the C accumulated during previous years.
However, using biomass as a fuel or wood to displace more energy-intensive materials can provide permanent carbon mitigation benefits.
It is useful to evaluate terrestrial sequestration opportunities alongside emission reduction strategies, as both approaches will likely be required to control atmospheric CO
Carbon reservoirs in most ecosystems eventually approach some maximum level.
The total amount of carbon stored and/or carbon emission avoided by a forest management project at any given time is dependent on the specific management practices (see Figure TS.6 ).
Thus, an ecosystem depleted of carbon by past events may have a high potential rate of carbon accumulation, while one with a large carbon pool tends to have a low rate of carbon sequestration.
As ecosystems eventually approach their maximum carbon pool, the sink (i.e., the rate of change of the pool) will diminish.
Although both the sequestration rate and pool of carbon may be relatively high at some stages, they cannot be maximized simultaneously.
Thus, management strategies for an ecosystem may depend on whether the goal is to enhance short-term accumulation or to maintain the carbon reservoirs through time.
The ecologically achievable balance between the two goals is constrained by disturbance history, site productivity, and target time frame.
For example, options to maximize sequestration by 2010 may not maximize sequestration by 2020 or 2050; in some cases, maximizing sequestration by 2010 may lead to lower carbon storage over time.
The effectiveness of C mitigation strategies, and the security of expanded C pools, will be affected by future global changes, but the impacts of these changes will vary by geographical region, ecosystem type, and local abilities to adapt.
For example, increases in atmospheric CO
, changes in climate, modified nutrient cycles, and altered (either natural or human induced disturbance) regimes can each have negative or positive effects on C pools in terrestrial ecosystems.
emissions for that time period.
Though these estimates do not include changes in litter and soils, they illustrate that land surfaces play a significant and changing role in the atmospheric carbon budget.
Enhancing these carbon pools provides potentially powerful opportunities for climate mitigation.
In some tropical countries, however, the average net loss of forest carbon stocks continues, though rates of deforestation may have declined slightly in the past decade.
In agricultural lands, options are now available to recover partially the C lost during the conversion from forest or grasslands.
Land is a precious and limited resource used for many purposes in every country.
The relationship of climate mitigation strategies with other land uses may be competitive, neutral, or symbiotic.
An analysis of the literature suggests that C mitigation strategies can be pursued as one element of more comprehensive strategies aimed at sustainable development, where increasing C stocks is but one of many objectives.
Often, measures can be adopted within forestry, agriculture, and other land uses to provide C mitigation and, at the same time, also advance other social, economic, and environmental goals.
Carbon mitigation can provide additional value and income to land management and rural development.
Local solutions and targets can be adapted to priorities of sustainable development at national, regional, and global levels.
A key to making C mitigation activities effective and sustainable is to balance it with other ecological and/or environmental, economic, and social goals of land use.
Many biological mitigation strategies may be neutral or favourable for all three goals and become accepted as “no regrets” or “win-win” solutions.
In other cases, compromises may be needed.
Important potential environmental impacts include effects on biodiversity, effects on amount and quality of water resources (particularly where they are already scarce), and long-term impacts on ecosystem productivity.
Cumulative environmental, economic, and social impacts could be assessed in individual projects and also from broader, national and international perspectives.
An important issue is “leakage” – an expanded or conserved C pool in one area leading to increased emissions elsewhere.
Social acceptance at the local, national, and global levels may also influence how effectively mitigation policies are implemented.
You can’t praise Betsy Kolbert enough, in my opinion.
She has been the must lucid, grounded, smart and committed journalist writing about climate change for several years.
In The War on Rachel Carson here from a couple of years ago, I wrote “Nota Bene - I put Betsy Kolbert in a class with Rachel Carson.
Kolbert’s Field Notes from a Catastrophe: Man, Nature, and Climate Change is a stunning picture of what we’re up against in confronting the specter of global warming.
About 20 years ago, I was helping run a workshop on acid rain for some Sierra Club activists and we’d invited some press, not thinking anyone would show up, but lo and behold, a young reporter for the ‘NY Times’ did: Betsy Kolbert.
We thought that was cool and so was she.”
If you read anybody on climate change, read Betsy Kolbert.
If you haven’t read Field Notes from a Catastrophe, run out now and get it.
Then start making some noise of your own.
The International Alliance of Research Universities (IARU), ten of the world’s leading research universities, and the University of Copenhagen , organized a conference that took place in Copenhagen this week.
The scientists, economists, journalists and others gathered heard some startling news in a series of updates on the science of climate change.
The IPCC issued its Fourth Assessment Report in 2007 - and shared the Nobel Peace Prize for its heroic work.
The conference was titled “ Climate Change: Global Risks, Challenges and Decisions ” and it served to update us on the science that was in the pipeline and completed after the IPCC report.
This video , with Conference Chair Katherine Richardson, explains the scope of the conference.
Olive Heffernan, editor of “Nature Reports: Climate Change” and its sister blog, Climate Feedback , reports here from Copenhagen.
“The latest results made for bleak listening at times,” she writes.
One key researcher, Stefan Rahmstorf, Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research , said: “Some aspects of climate are changing more rapidly than we thought even a few years ago.
It is thus critical to review the scientific data in Copenhagen before COP15 .” Rahmstorf himself had some arresting data on sea-level rise .
All the abstracts and full text for the many presentations and papers can be found here .
The BBC says here that “The worst-case scenarios on climate change envisaged by the UN two years ago are already being realised, say scientists at an international meeting.” Lord Nicholas Stern is quoted by the BBC: “So I think it’s very important that we understand the magnitude of the risk we are running.” Lord Stern is quoted in “ The Times ” as well: “Do the politicians understand just how difficult it could be, just how devastating four, five, six degrees centigrade would be?
I think, not yet.”
I’ve been lauding the new Presidential administration’s approach.
See “Climate of Change” and “The Eagle Has Landed” and other posts going back to November.
At the same time, as reported by Think Progress, it looks as if EPA is on an express train to a finding on whether or not climate change is a threat to public health.
See Leaked slides show Obama EPA is fast-tracking global warming endangerment finding.
Obama and Co. are hitting on all climate change cylinders.
Now if only the Senate would let John Holdren and Jane Lubchenco get to the critically important work they’ve got to do.
Henry Waxman has been My Man ever since the Acid Rain Wars of the 1980s.
He has been quietly but forcefully reconfiguring the House Energy and Commerce Committee to achieve an optimum environmental effect with the critical energy and climate change legislation that will be forthcoming this year.
In an article from ClimateWire in yesterday’s “NYT” about the present shape and trajectory of the legislation, Sen. Majority Leader Harry Reid said he would “package energy and global warming measures together into one large bill.” According to the article, it was Chairman Waxman who first convinced Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer, the powers that be in the House, of the one bill approach, and then the lobbying effort moved over to the Senate.
Sen. John Kerry, chairman of the Foreign Relations committee and a very strong advocate for a robust cap-and-trade regime, has also embraced the idea.
Remember also that Waxman’s former chief of staff, Phil Schiliro, is Obama’s Director of Legislative Affairs, so you would have to take a wild guess and figure that this has been walked through the White House.
Here’s a real whopper though: Two Presidential appointments of world-class scientists, warmly welcomed by the relevant Senate committees, are “on hold” because one Senator, Bob Menendez, doesn’t like the smell of Obama’s policy on Cuba.
Progress on confronting the climate change crisis is being held hostage to the most parochial of politics.
John Holdren will, eventually, lead the White House Office of Science and Technology and Jane Lubchenco will head up NOAA, two critical posts, and these two folks are both head of the class, 100% blue chip.
(See Obama’s Team, Continued here .
)
In “Climate of Change” , I celebrated the first Obama budget proposal, along with the economic stimulus package and the renewables tax credit package from the autumn, as just what the doctor ordered for the push to decarbonize the economy and create hundreds of thousands of green jobs.
Looking at climate change as much and as often as I do, I have come to have a heightened sense of the danger looming and the urgency of our situation.
Therefore, knowing that snow reflects solar radiation back into space, thus diminishing the radiative forcing on the earth, snow is something that has come to have an even greater positive association for me than it previously did.
Snow has a high albedo and so when I’m in it, I am reassured.
I grew up spending a lot of time outdoors, hiking and skiing, among other things, in the Northeast US.
This was one of the reasons I was so highly motivated to fight acid rain back in the 1980’s - because I had a connection to the mountains, forests, and the waters of the Northeast and didn’t like the idea of their being murdered by acid rain.
I still get out.
We were skiing over Presidents’ Week at Killington.
High-carbon footprint?
Yes. But Killington, much to my relief, has a pretty thoroughgoing and sound approach to energy and the environment .
They offset, for instance, 100 percent of their electric use through the purchase of Renewable Energy Credits (RECs).
We just had a big snowfall this week in NYC.
The calming effect of the snow is palpable.
Here’s a photo of the American Museum of Natural History after the snow with the banner for the big climate change exhibit juxtaposed against the Theodore Roosevelt statue .
Here are some reviews of some books on two environmental visionaries, an article about a world-famous campaigner against the looming specter of climate change, and a lucid, comprehensive and deep report on managing solid and hazardous wastes.
In The Ecstasy of John Muir , Robert Pogue Harrison reviews an apparently magisterial biography, A Passion for Nature: The Life of John Muir by Donald Worster.
(You have to have the print edition [imagine!
], or an electronic subscription, or pay $3 to read this.
) Harrison praises the book and eulogizes the man.
I’m an old Sierra Club activist and so share a very high regard for Muir from way back.
Harrison centers much of his review on Muir’s anti-materialist ethic, his affinity for nature.
Looking at our world today, Harrison asks: “What human civilization must do to survive materially is a question that is bound to engage us in the decades to come, yet alongside it there are other questions, easily brushed aside, that are no less paramount in import.
Will a greener technology transform our relation to nature?
Will a more sustainable economy merely provide a more sustainable basis for our consumerist sloth?
Does nature make any spiritual demands on us, or is it purely the supplier in a supply-demand relationship?” (Is nature a mere provider of “ecosystem services?”) For some more on this theme, see Galloping Consumption from the blog about a year back.
The FT’s Fiona Harvey, who I cite and laud often, as I did in the last post below, has reviews here of a book by James Lovelock and one about him.
I consider Lovelock a hugely less important visionary than Muir, but important nevertheless in his contemporaneity with the global environmental crisis.
He has been talking about what’s happening now.
His Gaia hypothesis, as Harvey points out, presaged the study of “… earth systems sciences, a new discipline that seeks to understand how the natural processes of the earth interact with one another.” He is also a prophet of climate change doom, and wholeheartedly embraces nuclear power, and these are both points with which I, among a good many others, take vigorous exception.
Finally, I touched on waste management in the last post below.
Here is an excellent look at the subject from “The Economist.” Great reading, well worth your time.
I was at an event recently at NYU’s Center for Global Affairs (where I’m teaching) and Elisabeth Rosenthal, the “NY Times” environmental reporter based in Europe, was being interviewed.
She touched on a number of important subjects including the talks in Poznań in December, some of the international politics of climate change, and an interesting approach to green building: “passive” houses .
Passive houses employ fairly simple principles of ultraefficient insulation and heat exchange.
In the same vein - simple and easy - she had an article recently on the burgeoning practice in Britain of converting used cooking oil to transportation fuel .
There’s a terrific article from another terrific environmental reporter, Fiona Harvey, in today’s “FT” about biochar.
This is a comprehensive look at a technology that has enormous potential to not only sequester billions of tons of carbon but also to reduce the need for nitrogen fertilizers that cost farmers all over the world boatloads of money and also cause massive environmental damage, including pouring nitrous oxide, a potent GHG, into the atmosphere.
Where do you get the biomass?
Agricultural waste and certain components of municipal solid waste are two excellent sources.
How do you make it?
Pyrolysis - “a form of controlled thermal decomposition of organic material in the absence of oxygen.” (Long before I knew about biochar, I conceived of pyrolysis as an integral part of an urban solid waste management scheme that I’d noodled and promulgated to a great number of people in New York City.
See the last paragraph of this post from a couple of years ago for more on my “Urban Gold” concept.
)
United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has challenged governments to act on the findings of a major new report on climate change.
Launching the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, he said real and affordable ways to deal with the problem existed.
The IPCC states that climate change is "unequivocal" and may bring "abrupt and irreversible" impacts.
The IPCC report synthesises the three aspects of climate change that it has already pronounced on earlier in the year, on the science, the likely impacts, and options for dealing with the problem.
Among the top-line conclusions are that climate change is "unequivocal", that humankind's emissions of greenhouse gases are more than 90% likely to be the main cause, and that impacts can be reduced at reasonable cost.
between 75m and 250m people are projected to have scarcer fresh water supplies than at present
Even if levels of CO2 in the atmosphere stayed where they are now, he said, research showed sea levels would rise by between 0.4 and 1.4 metres simply because sea water would continue warming up, which makes it expand.
"This is a very important finding, likely to bring major changes to coastlines and inundating low-lying areas, with a great effect in river deltas and low-lying islands," he said.
"If you add to this the melting of some of the ice bodies on Earth, this gives a picture of the kinds of issue we are likely to face.
"
This is the IPCC's fourth major assessment of global climate change since its formation nearly 20 years ago.
During the course of its existence, it has become more certain that modern-day climate change is real and principally due to human activities; it has also become firmer about the scale of the impacts.
There are indications that projected increases in droughts are also happening earlier than expected, he said, though that was less certain.
Without extra measures, carbon dioxide emissions will continue to rise; they are already growing faster than a decade ago, partly because of increasing use of coal.
The IPCC's economic analyses say that trend can be reversed at reasonable cost.
Indeed, it says, there is "much evidence that mitigation actions can result in near-term co-benefits (e.g.
improved health due to reduced air pollution)" that may offset costs.
The panel's scientists say the reversal needs to come within a decade or so if the worst effects of global warming are to be avoided.
The findings will feed into the Bali talks on the UN climate convention and the Kyoto Protocol which open on 3 December.

ABSTRACT: Anthropogenic climate change does not only affect water resources but also water demand.
Future water and food security will depend, among other factors, on the impact of climate change on water demand for irrigation.
Using a recently developed global irrigation model, with a spatial resolution of 0.5° by 0.5°, we present the first global analysis of the impact of climate change and climate variability on irrigation water requirements.
We compute how long-term average irrigation requirements might change under the climatic conditions of the 2020s and the 2070s, as provided by two climate models, and relate these changes to the variations in irrigation requirements caused by long-term and interannual climate variability in the 20th century.
Two-thirds of the global area equipped for irrigation in 1995 will possibly suffer from increased water requirements, and on up to half of the total area (depending on the measure of variability), the negative impact of climate change is more significant than that of climate variability.

ABSTRACT: One concern of agriculturalists when regarding climate change involves the effects on pest populations.
Climate change may allow pest migration or population expansions which may adversely affect agricultural productivity, profitability and possibly even viability.
We examine the effect of current climate variations on the average and variability of U.S. per acre pesticide costs across the U.S. as a proxy for investigating the consequence for pest populations.
Empirically, we find that increases in rainfall increases average per acre pesticide usage costs for corn, cotton, potatoes, soybeans, and wheat while hotter weather increases pesticide costs for corn, cotton, potatoes, and soybeans but decreases the cost for wheat.
We also investigated the influence of climate on the variability of pesticide costs.
There we find that hotter temperatures increase pesticide cost variance for corn, potatoes, and wheat while decreasing it for soybeans.
Rainfall increases cause an increase in cost variability for cotton while decreasing it for corn, potatoes, soybeans, and wheat.
ABSTRACT: In the interplay of the soil and the atmosphere, the soil can be both a contributor to and a recipient of the impacts of climate change.
In the past, land management has generally resulted in considerable depletion of soil organic matter and the relase into the atmosphere of such radiatively active gases as carbon dioxide, methame, and nitrous oxide.
Global climate change, to the extent that it occurs, will strongly impact all soil processes.
At this time, the task of soil management should be to restore soil organic carbon in order to enhance soil structure and fertility and to help counter the atmospheric greenhouse effect.
Widely varying estimates of the soil's organic carbon content and of the potential for soil carbon sequestration point to the need to conduct a comprehensive inventory of this important property.

"Effects of climate change and elevated CO2 on cropping systems: Model predictions at two Italian locations," European Journal of Agronomy, Vol.
12, pp.
179-189.
ABSTRACT:The potential effects of future climate change were investigated, corresponding to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 from 350 to 700 ppm, on agricultural production of four different cropping systems at two Italian locations, Modena and Foggia.
Climate change scenarios, derived from two general circulation models (GCMs), were used as weather input to a soil-plant growth simulator, CropSyst.
The model was recently modified to include the effects of elevated CO2 on crop photosynthesis and transpiration.
Six different crops in total were simulated at the two Italian sites.
At Modena, a 3-year maize-maize-wheat rotation and a 2-year soybean-barley-summer sorghum rotation were studied.
At Foggia, a 2-year sunflower-wheat-fallow rotation, and a 2-year wheat-fallow-spring sorghum rotation were simulated.
Results suggested that the combined effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 and climate change at both sites would depress crop yields if current management practices were not modified.
Specifically, warmer air temperatures accelerated plant phenology, reducing dry matter accumulation and crop yields by 10-40%.
By investigating adaptation strategies, it was found that a combination of early planting for spring-summer crops and the use of slower-maturing winter cereal cultivars succeeds in maintaining crop yields at current levels at both sites.
For irrigated maize and soybean production at Modena, 60-90% more irrigation water was required under climate change to keep grain yields at current levels.
This implies that adaptation to climate change may be limited for irrigated crops, depending on site-specific water availability.

ABSTRACT: Many who study global change, particularly from industrialized countries, are optimistic about the capacity of agriculture to successfully adapt to climate change.
This optimism is based on historic trends in yield increases, on the spread of cropping systems far beyond their traditional agroecological boundaries, and the inherent flexibility of systems of international trade.
Analysis of the success (or in rare cases, failure) of adaptation is by analogy-either to analogous socioeconomic or technological change or to short term environmental change.
Such studies have been limited to industrialized countries.
This paper uses five analogs from developing countries to examine potential adaptation to global climate change by poor people.
Two are studies of comparative developing country responses to drought, flood, and tropical cyclone and to the Sahelian droughts of the 1970s and 80s that illustrate adaptations to climate and weather events:.
Two address food production and rapid population growth in South Asia and Africa.
Three types of adaptive social costs are considered: the direct costs of adaptation, the costs of adapting to the adaptations, and the costs of failing to adapt.
A final analog reviews 30 village-level studies for the role that these social costs of adaptation play in perpetuating poverty and environmental degradation.
ABSTRACT: An attempt is made to assess the sensitivity of food production to various aspects of global change and environmental degradation during the next few decades.
As a tool for this study a spreadsheet accounting system for food demand and supply is used.
Taking into account the uncertainties of the various influencing factors, such as new technologies, improved management, increased fertilizer use, climatic change, expansion of irrigation, soil degradation and loss of agricultural land, the study indicates that one cannot say with any certainty whether or not food supply will meet expected demand in 2025, especially in Less Developed Countries.
Bringing into use 10% of available potential cropland will make little difference.
ABSTRACT: A review is given of the state of knowledge in the field of assessing climate change impacts on agricultural crops and livestock.
Starting from the basic processes controlling plant growth and development, the possible impacts and interactions of climatic and other biophysical variables in different agro-environments are highlighted.
Qualitative and quantitative estimations of shifts in biomass production and water relations, inter-plant competition and crop species adaptability are discussed.
Special attention is given to the problems encountered when scaling up physiological responses at the leaf- and plant level to yield estimates at regional to global levels by using crop simulation models in combination with geo-referenced, agro-ecological databases.
Some non-linear crop responses to environmental changes and their relations to adaptability and vulnerability of agro-ecosystems are discussed.
ABSTRACT: This article reviews the current state of knowledge on the response of soils to climate change, and the implications such changes have for agriculture.
The article is based on the material reported in the IPCC second assessment report (Watson et al., 1996) and updated with more recent information, where appropriate.
The review highlights the importance of understanding the dynamics of soil processes when addressing climate change impacts on agriculture.
Rapid soil responses to climate change (e.g.
soil water, organic carbon and erodibility) have been widely investigated and reported in the literature.
However, it is important that longer-term processes (e.g.
pedogenesis) are not ignored by the research community because these have potentially important implications for long-term agricultural land use and are often irreversible.
The use of good land management practices, as currently understood, provides the best strategy for adaptation to the impact of climate change on soils.
However, it appears likely that farmers will need to carefully reconsider their management options, and land use change is likely to result from different crop selections that are more appropriate to the changing conditions.
Perhaps the greatest impact of climate change on soils will arise from climate-induced changes in land use and management.
ABSTRACT: The geographic distribution, vigor, virulence, and agricultural impact of weeds, insects, and plant pathogens will be affected by climatic changes accompanying the global "greenhouse effect.
" Weed/crop competitive interactions, particularly among species differing in photosynthetic pathway (C3 v C4), may be altered, with the C3 species favored by increasing CO2.
Physiological and biochemical changes induced in host crop plants by rising CO2 may affect feeding patterns of pest insects.
Compilation of climatic thresholds for phenological development of pest insects reveals the potential for shifts in pest behavior induced by global warming and other climatic change.
Generation times may be reduced, enabling more rapid population increases to occur.
Poleward migration may be accelerated during the crop season.
The epidemiology of plant diseases also will be altered.
Prediction of disease outbreaks will be more difficult in periods of rapidly changing climate and unstable weather.
Environmental instability and increased incidence of extreme weather may reduce the effectiveness of pesticides on targeted pests or result in more injury to non-target organisms.
Biological control may be affected either negatively or positively.
Overall, the challenge to agriculture from pests probably will increase.

ABSTRACT: Climate change assessments which have considered climate impacts of a 2xCO2 climate, using models of the global agricultural system, have found small impacts on overall production, but larger regional changes.
Production shifts among regions can be considered one mechanism for adaptation.
Adaptation at the farm level, through changes in crops, cultivars, and production practices, is another adaptation mechanism.
Existing studies differ in how important these mechanisms will be.
Studies that have considered yield effects at specific sites have found very wide ranges of impacts.
A useful way to evaluate the impacts of climate change, given the uncertainty about future impacts, is to consider vulnerability.
Studies have defined vulnerability in terms of yield, farm profitability, regional economy, and hunger.
Vulnerability and climate impacts, particularly in terms of higher order effects on profitability and sustainability, will depend on how society and the economy develop.
Lower income populations and marginal agricultural regions, particularly arid or flood prone areas, are most vulnerable to climate change.
ABSTRACT:Building on previous work quantitative estimates of climate change impacts on global food production have been made for the UK Hadley Centre's HadCM2 greenhouse gas only ensemble experiment and the more recent HadCM3 experiment (Hulme et al., 1999).
The consequences for world food prices and the number of people at risk of hunger as defined by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO, 1988) have also been assessed.
Climate change is expected to increase yields at high and mid-latitudes, and lead to decreases at lower latitudes.
This pattern becomes more pronounced as time progresses.
The food system may be expected to accommodate such regional variations at the global level, with production, prices and the risk of hunger being relatively unaffected by the additional stress of climate change.
By the 2080s the additional number of people at risk of hunger due to climate change is about 80 million people (±10 million depending on which of the four HadCM2 ensemble members is selected).
However, some regions (particularly the arid and sub-humid tropics) will be adversely affected.
A particular example is Africa, which is expected to experience marked reductions in yield, decreases in production, and increases in the risk of hunger as a result of climate change.
The continent can expect to have between 55 and 65 million extra people at risk of hunger by the 2080s under the HadCM2 climate scenario.
Under the HadCM3 climate scenario the effect is even more severe, producing an estimated additional 70+ million people at risk of hunger in Africa.

ABSTRACT: An analysis of climate change impacts on the level of agricultural production is presented based on long-term experimental data on yields of crops grown in different soils and climatic zones.
Mathematical models combining available data on the biology of agricultural crops and their response to climatic conditions have been used.
The principle of maximum plant productivity is the basis of this modelling effort.
The potential and meteorologically possible yields under existing environmental conditions were calculated using the potato dynamic model POMOD.
The analyses were completed under different climate change scenarios.
According to the climate change scenarios HADCM2 and ECHAM3TR, mean potato yields will increase by about 6 to 8%.
The yield increase is larger (10 to 16%) on coastal islands and in North Estonia.
A new approach and classification of micro-climate geo-complexes was developed.
Agricultural production was found to be highly sensitive to micro-climatic variations.
The proposed approach permits more objective use of meteorological data in changing climatic conditions.
Shifts in agroclimate were established using this modelling approach.
The sums of degree-days, particularly above 0 and 5°C, have significantly risen during the period 1807-1995.
The development of potato varieties adapted to a changing climate is possible.
A strategy for adaptation of agriculture to climate change is presented.
ABSTRACT: Recent studies on the nature of global warming indicate the likelihood of an asymmetric change in temperature, where night-time minimum temperature increases more rapidly than the day-time maximum temperature.
We used a physically based scenario of asymmetric warming combined with climate change scenarios from General Circulation Models (GCMs) outputs and the EPIC (Erosion Productivity Impact Calculator) plant process model to examine the effects of asymmetric temperature change on crop productivity.
Our results indicated that the potential effects of global change on crop productivity may be less severe with asymmetric day-night warming than with equal day-night warming.

"The effect of changes in daily and interannual climatic variability on CERES-Wheat: A sensitivity study," Climatic Change, Vol.
32, pp.
257-292.
ABSTRACT: We investigate the effect of changes in daily and interannual variability of temperature and precipitation on yields simulated by the CERES-Wheat model at two locations in the central Great Plains.
Changes in variability were effected by adjusting parameters in the Richardson daily weather generator.
Two types of changes in precipitation were created: one with both intensity and frequency changes; and another with change only in persistence.
In both types mean total monthly precipitation is held constant.
Changes in daily (and interannual) variability of temperature result in substantial changes in the mean and variability of simulated wheat yields.
With a doubling of temperature variability, large reductions in mean yield and increases in variability of yield result primarily from crop failures due to winter kill at both locations.
Reduced temperature variability has little effect.
Changes in daily precipitation variability also resulted in substantial changes in mean and variability of yield.
Interesting interactions of the precipitation variability changes with the contrasting base climates are found at the two locations.
At one site where soil moisture is not limiting, mean yield decreased and variability of yield increased with increasing precipitation variability, whereas mean yields increased at the other location, where soil moisture is limiting.
Yield changes were similar for the two different types of precipitation variability change investigated.
Compared to an earlier study for the same locations wherein variability changes were effected by altering observed time series, and the focus was on interannual variability, the present results for yield changes are much more substantial.
This study demonstrates the importance of taking into account change in daily (and interannual) variability of climate when analyzing the effect of climate change on crop yields.
ABSTRACT: A global assessment of the potential impact of climate change on world food supply suggests that doubling of the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration will lead to only a small decrease in global crop production.
But developing countries are likely to bear the brunt of the problem, and simulations of the effect of adaptive measures by farmers imply that these will do little to reduce the dispatiry between developed and developing countries.
ABSTRACT: What is known about the implications of climate change for world food security?
This special issue draws on material presented at a recent international workshop at the University of Oxford.
It focuses especially on the distributional impacts of a changing climate and the different levels and sources of vulnerability to environmental change.
It reviews recent results from two international agricultural models and examines the potential impacts on agriculture of measures to prevent climate change.
A companion special issue of the journal Food Policy addresses the regional and global context of future food security in relationship to a changing environment.
ABSTRACT: This paper summarizes the findings of a major interdisciplinary research effort by scientists in 25 countries.
The study examined the potential biophysical responses of major food crops to changing atmospheric composition and climate, and projected potential socioeconomic consequences.
In a first step crop models were used to estimate how changing climatic conditions might alter yields of major crops at a number of sites representing both major production areas and vulnerable regions at low, mid and high latitudes.
Then a dynamic recursive national-level model of the world food system was used to assess socio-economic impacts for the period 1990 up to year 2060.
ABSTRACT: Estimates of the potential effect of three different climate scenarios for world agriculture are made.
The scenarios show that the impacts differ significantly among the scenarios and among countries.
The direct impact of climate change on yield, the global effect on commodity prices, and the export/import status of a country are shown to determine the economic winners and losers.
The trade effects and the high degree of uncertainty should be critical considerations in adaptation policies.

ABSTRACT: Coping with climatic variations or future climate change must be rooted in a full understanding of the complex structures and causes of present vulnerability, and how it may evolve over the coming decades.
A theory of the social vulnerability of food insecurity draws upon explanations in human ecology, expanded entitlements and political economy to map the risk of exposure to harmful perturbations, ability to cope with crises, and potential for recovery.
Vulnerable socio-economic groups in Zimbabwe and the potential effects of climate change illustrate some of the applications of the theory.
ABSTRACT: The battle to achieve sustainable growth in agricultural production must be fought out along a broad multidisciplinary front.
Poverty undermines health and degrades the environment.
Environmental problems link the agricultural and health research agendas.
Environmental changes underway at the global level will require changes in food production and health practices.
Effective bridges must be built between the `island empires' of the agricultural, environmental, and health sciences.
More effective linkages must be built between the suppliers of knowledge and technology and the users.
ABSTRACT: We provide here an evaluation of the potential effect of climate change, induced by greenhouse gases, on food production and the number of people at risk of hunger due to such changes.
This is a modelling exercise, starting with existing models of climate change itself, then how crop yields might respond under those different scenarios and then assimilating the economic consequences of those yields in the world food trade model.
This global study is being coordinated by the US Environmental Protection Agency and scientists in twenty-five countries took part.

117, No.

157-178.
ABSTRACT: Effects of CO2-induced climatic changes on irrigation-water requirements (IR) in the Great Plains region were evaluated using results of global atmospheric-circulation models with a water balance-IR model.
Increases were predicted for evapotranspiration Et due to predicted increases in air temperature, solar radiation, and wind speed under doubled concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (2×CO2).
Predicted increases in humidity under the 2×CO2 scenarios and shifting of crop life cycles to months with lower levels of solar radiation partially counteracted predicted increases in Et.
Increases in irrigation requirements were caused primarily by increases in evaporative demands and changes in precipitation patterns.
Increases in net seasonal IR for alfalfa were larger due to predicted increases in length of frost-free growing seasons and higher evaporative demands as compared to winter wheat and corn.
Decreases or only modest increases in seasonal irrigation requirements were projected under 2×CO2 scenarios for corn and winter wheat due to reductions in length of crop life cycles and projected increases in bulk stomatal resistances.
It seems obvious that any significant change in climate on a global scale should impact local agriculture, and therefore affect the world's food supply.
Considerable study has gone into questions of just how farming might be affected in different regions, and by how much; and whether the net result may be harmful or beneficial, and to whom.
Several uncertainties limit the accuracy of current projections.
One relates to the degree of temperature increase and its geographic distribution.
Another pertains to the concomitant changes likely to occur in the precipitation patterns that determine the water supply to crops, and to the evaporative demand imposed on crops by the warmer climate.
There is a further uncertainty regarding the physiological response of crops to enriched carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
The problem of predicting the future course of agriculture in a changing world is compounded by the fundamental complexity of natural agricultural systems, and of the socioeconomic systems governing world food supply and demand.
What happens to the agricultural economy in a given region, or country, or county, will depend on the interplay of the set of dynamic factors specific to each area.
Scientific studies, typically based on computer models, have for some time examined the effects of postulated climate and atmospheric carbon dioxide changes on specific agroecosystems--a now common term that defines the interactive unit made up of a crop community, such as a field of wheat or corn, and its biophysical environment.
We have more recently gone a step farther by developing methods to study these systems in more integrated regional and global contexts.
Both biophysical and socioeconomic processes are taken into account in these integrated studies, since agricultural production is a player in both worlds: it is very much dependent upon environmental variables and is in turn an important agent of environmental change and a determinant of market prices.
Climate change presents crop production with prospects for both benefits and drawbacks, some of which are shown schematically in Figure 1 .
To address any of them more clearly we must first define the main interactions that link a chain of processes together: food is derived from crops (or from animals that consume crops); crops in turn grow in fields, which exist in farms, which are components of farming communities, which are sectors in nation states, and which ultimately take part in the international food trade system.
Understanding the potential impacts of global environmental change on this sequence of interlocking elements is a first step in modeling what will happen when any one of them is changed as a result of possible global warming, and a prerequisite for defining appropriate societal responses.
In this summary we look first at the possible biophysical responses of agroecosystems to the specific environmental changes that are anticipated as a result of the buildup of global greenhouse gases, and then at the range of adaptive actions that might be taken to ameliorate their effects.
In subsequent sections we draw on our own and other modeling studies to show examples of regional and global assessments that have so far been made, including discussions of the effects of uncertainty, thresholds, and surprises, and the possible consequences of global warming on agricultural sustainability and food security.
Finally we give our own views on two potentially misleading notions regarding climate change and agriculture.
Plants grow through the well-known process of photosynthesis, utilizing the energy of sunlight to convert water from the soil and carbon dioxide from the air into sugar, starches, and cellulose--the carbohydrates that are the foundations of the entire food chain.
CO
enters a plant through its leaves.
Greater atmospheric concentrations tend to increase the difference in partial pressure between the air outside and inside the plant leaves, and as a result more CO
enrichment crops may use less water even while they produce more carbohydrates.
This dual effect will likely improve water-use efficiency, which is the ratio between crop biomass and the amount of water consumed.
At the same time, associated climatic effects, such as higher temperatures, changes in rainfall and soil moisture, and increased frequencies of extreme meteorological events, could either enhance or negate potentially beneficial effects of enhanced atmospheric CO
In middle and higher latitudes, global warming will extend the length of the potential growing season, allowing earlier planting of crops in the spring, earlier maturation and harvesting, and the possibility of completing two or more cropping cycles during the same season.
Crop-producing areas may expand poleward in countries such as Canada and Russia, although yields in higher latitudes will likely be lower due to the less fertile soils that lie there.
Many crops have become adapted to the growing-season daylengths of the middle and lower latitudes and may not respond well to the much longer days of the high latitude summers.
In warmer, lower latitude regions, increased temperatures may accelerate the rate at which plants release CO
Agriculture of any kind is strongly influenced by the availability of water.
Climate change will modify rainfall, evaporation, runoff, and soil moisture storage.
Changes in total seasonal precipitation or in its pattern of variability are both important.
The occurrence of moisture stress during flowering, pollination, and grain-filling is harmful to most crops and particularly so to corn, soybeans, and wheat.
Increased evaporation from the soil and accelerated transpiration in the plants themselves will cause moisture stress; as a result there will be a need to develop crop varieties with greater drought tolerance.
The demand for water for irrigation is projected to rise in a warmer climate, bringing increased competition between agriculture--already the largest consumer of water resources in semiarid regions--and urban as well as industrial users.
Falling water tables and the resulting increase in the energy needed to pump water will make the practice of irrigation more expensive, particularly when with drier conditions more water will be required per acre.
Some land--such as the region of the U.S. supplied by the Ogallala aquifer (including parts of Nebraska, Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado, and New Mexico)--may be taken out of irrigation, following a trend that has already begun, with loss of considerable prior investment.
Peak irrigation demands are also predicted to rise due to more severe heat waves.
Additional investment for dams, reservoirs, canals, wells, pumps, and piping may be needed to develop irrigation networks in new locations.
Finally, intensified evaporation will increase the hazard of salt accumulation in the soil.
Extreme meteorological events, such as spells of high temperature, heavy storms, or droughts, disrupt crop production.
Recent studies have considered possible changes in the variability as well as in the mean values of climatic variables.
Where certain varieties of crops are grown near their limits of maximum temperature tolerance, such as rice in Southern Asia, heat spells can be particularly detrimental.
Similarly, frequent droughts not only reduce water supplies but also increase the amount of water needed for plant transpiration.
Higher air temperatures will also be felt in the soil, where warmer conditions are likely to speed the natural decomposition of organic matter and to increase the rates of other soil processes that affect fertility.
Additional application of fertilizer may be needed to counteract these processes and to take advantage of the potential for enhanced crop growth that can result from increased atmospheric CO
.
This can come at the cost of environmental risk, for additional use of chemicals may impact water and air quality.
The continual cycling of plant nutrients--carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and sulfur--in the soil-plant-atmosphere system is also likely to accelerate in warmer conditions, enhancing CO
, if soil moisture is not limiting.
Where they occur, drier soil conditions will suppress both root growth and decomposition of organic matter, and will increase vulnerability to wind erosion, especially if winds intensify.
An expected increase in convective rainfall--caused by stronger gradients of temperature and pressure and more atmospheric moisture--may result in heavier rainfall when and where it does occur.
Such "extreme precipitation events" can cause increased soil erosion.
Conditions are more favorable for the proliferation of insect pests in warmer climates.
Longer growing seasons will enable insects such as grasshoppers to complete a greater number of reproductive cycles during the spring, summer, and autumn.
Warmer winter temperatures may also allow larvae to winter-over in areas where they are now limited by cold, thus causing greater infestation during the following crop season.
Altered wind patterns may change the spread of both wind-borne pests and of the bacteria and fungi that are the agents of crop disease.
Crop-pest interactions may shift as the timing of development stages in both hosts and pests is altered.
Livestock diseases may be similarly affected.
The possible increases in pest infestations may bring about greater use of chemical pesticides to control them, a situation that will require the further development and application of integrated pest management techniques.
Global warming is predicted to lead to thermal expansion of sea water, along with partial melting of land-based glaciers and sea-ice, resulting in a rise of sea level which may range from 0.1 to 0.5 meters (4 to 20 inches) by the middle of the next century, according to present estimates of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
Such a rise could pose a threat to agriculture in low- lying coastal areas, where impeded drainage of surface water and of groundwater, as well as intrusion of sea water into estuaries and aquifers, might take place.
In parts of Egypt, Bangladesh, Indonesia, China, the Netherlands, Florida, and other low-lying coastal areas already suffering from poor drainage, agriculture is likely to become increasingly difficult to sustain.
Some island states are particularly at risk.
A wide variety of adaptive actions may be taken to lessen or overcome adverse effects of climate change on agriculture.
At the level of farms, adjustments may include the introduction of later- maturing crop varieties or species, switching cropping sequences, sowing earlier, adjusting timing of field operations, conserving soil moisture through appropriate tillage methods, and improving irrigation efficiency.
Some options such as switching crop varieties may be inexpensive while others, such as introducing irrigation (especially high-efficiency, water-conserving technologies), involve major investments.
Economic adjustments include shifts in regional production centers and adjustments of capital, labor, and land allocations.
For example, trade adjustments should help to shift commodity production to regions where comparative advantage improves; in areas where comparative advantage declines, labor and capital may move out of agriculture into more productive sectors.
Studies combining biophysical and economic impacts show that, in general, market adjustments can indeed moderate the impacts of reduced yields.
A major adaptive response will be the breeding of heat- and drought-resistant crop varieties by utilizing genetic resources that may be better adapted to new climatic and atmospheric conditions.
Collections of such genetic resources are maintained in germ-plasm banks; these may be screened to find sources of resistance to changing diseases and insects, as well as tolerances to heat and water stress and better compatibility to new agricultural technologies.
Crop varieties with a higher harvest index (the fraction of total plant matter that is marketable) will help to keep irrigated production efficient under conditions of reduced water supplies or enhanced demands.
Genetic manipulation may also help to exploit the beneficial effects of CO
Recent studies by the National Research Council and other organizations have emphasized the ability of U.S. farming to adapt to changing conditions, since in the past technological improvements have indeed been developed and put into use when needed.
The U.S. has substantial agricultural research capabilities and a wide range of adaptation options is currently available to farmers in this country.
Hence, insofar as the U.S. is concerned, prospects for agricultural adaptation to climate change appear favorable, assuming water is available.
Considerable investments may be needed, however, to utilize soil and water resources more efficiently in a changed climate.
Other countries, particularly in the tropics and semi-tropics, are not so well provisioned with respect to both the research base and the availability of investment capital.
The potential for adaptation should not lead to complacency.
Agricultural adaptation to climatic variation is not now and may never be perfect, and changes in how farmers operate or in what they produce may cause significant disruption for people in rural regions.
Indeed, some adaptive measures may have detrimental impacts of their own.
For example, were major shifts in crops to be made, as from grain to fruit and vegetable production, farmers may find themselves more exposed to marketing problems and credit crises brought on by higher capital and operating costs.
The considerable social and economic costs that can result from large- scale climatic extremes was exemplified by the consequences of the Mississippi River flood of 1993.
While changes in planting schedules or in crop varieties may be readily adopted, modifying the types of crops grown does not ensure equal levels of either food production or nutritional quality.
Nor can it guarantee equal profits for farmers.
Expanded irrigation may lead to groundwater depletion, soil salinization, and waterlogging.
Increased demand for water by competing sectors may limit the viability of irrigation as an adaptation to climate change.
Expansion of irrigation as a response to climate change will be difficult and costly even under the best circumstances.
Mounting societal pressures to reduce environmental damage from agriculture will likely foster an increase in protective regulatory policies that can further complicate the process of adaptation.
Present agricultural institutions and policies in the U.S. tend to discourage farm management adaptation strategies, such as altering the mix of crops that are grown.
At the policy level, obstacles to change are created by supporting prices of crops that are not well suited to a changing climate, by providing disaster payments when crops fail, and by restricting competition through import quotas.
Programs could be modified to expand the flexibility allowed in crop mixes, to remove institutional barriers to the development of water markets, and to improve the basis for crop disaster payments.
Adaptation cannot be taken for granted: improvements in agriculture have always depended upon on the investment that is made in agricultural research and infrastructure.
It would help to identify, through research, the specific ways that farmers now adapt to present variations in climate.
Do farmers attempt to compensate for a less favorable climate by applying more fertilizer, more machinery, or more labor?
Information of this nature is needed to assess potentialities for coping with more drastic climate change.
Success in adapting to possible future climate change will depend on a better definition of what changes will occur where, and on prudent investments, made in timely fashion, in adaptation strategies.
In studying the impacts of climate change, attempts are made to link state-of-the-art models developed by researchers in disparate disciplines--including climatology, agronomy, and economics--in order to project future food supplies.
Present global circulation models, or GCMs, calculate the temporal and spatial transports and exchanges of heat and moisture throughout the Earth's surface and atmosphere.
These models are used to predict changes in temperature, precipitation, radiation, and other climate variables caused by increases in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
They are used as well to develop "practice climates" or climate change scenarios for use in impact studies.
Crop models then predict the response of specific crops to alternative sets of climate and CO
The GCM-based assessment of the IPCC contemplates a change in global surface temperature of 1.5 to 4.5°C by the year 2050, as a result of enhanced greenhouse gases.
While global agricultural production may increase at the lower limit of the predicted range or decrease at the higher limit, global effects measured with current economic valuation techniques are generally predicted to be moderate.
The reason is that the world economic system has been generally effective in fostering adaptation to current biophysical constraints on crop production and in realizing opportunities for improving crop production.
This macroeconomic perspective, however, speaks only to the averaged global effect and not to specific regional and social impacts.
Model studies done to date concur that there will be significant changes in regional agricultural patterns as a result of climate change.
All regions are likely to be affected, but some regions will be impacted more adversely than others.
The timing of regional effects--who gains or loses when and for how long--will also be complex, as is illustrated in Figure 2 in terms of modeled changes in country-by-country wheat yield.
Modeled studies of the sensitivity of world agriculture to potential climate change have suggested that the overall effect of moderate climate change on world food production may be small, as reduced production in some areas is balanced by gains in others.
The same studies find, however, that vulnerability to climate change is systematically greater in developing countries--which in most cases are located in lower, warmer latitudes.
In those regions, cereal grain yields are projected to decline under climate change scenarios, across the full range of expected warming.
Agricultural exporters in middle and high latitudes (such as the U.S., Canada, and Australia) stand to gain, as their national production is predicted to expand, and particularly if grain supplies are restricted and prices rise.
Thus, countries with the lowest income may be the hardest hit.
Yet, not all impacts in developing countries may be negative.
Inland areas located far from sources of precipitation may suffer increased aridity, whereas areas in the path of rain-bearing winds may benefit from increased rainfall.
A point that needs to be stressed is that the ability of any country to take advantage of the opportunities and to avoid the drawbacks as climate changes will depend on the availability of adequate resources as well as on the quality of the research base.
The presently inadequate capacity of agricultural research systems in the tropics and semi-tropics will need to be rectified, and this task can best be achieved through international cooperation.
Some observers believe that climate change will exert its influence so slowly--a fraction of a degree per decade--that the effects will be barely noticeable in the midst of other technological and economic changes.
Others emphasize the need to study the potential for what are called "threshold effects"--i.e., the abrupt and disproportionate shifts in production that may be triggered when critical levels of certain factors are surpassed.
Unexpected consequences or "surprises" may well accompany the buildup of greenhouse gases.
Even if climate changes gradually, it will slowly affect the range of options available for agriculture in any given region.
Under changing climate conditions, farmers' past experience will be a less reliable predictor of what is to come.
These and other uncertainties must be taken into account explicitly in climate change impact studies.
The uncertainty inherent in predictions is a very important feature of climate change impact studies, and work has begun to develop explicit methods to deal with the concept.
Earlier studies had often used "best estimate" scenarios that were based on the mid-points of the predicted range of expected change in temperature, precipitation, or other parameters.
Including the entire range from the upper to the lower bounds of predicted effects is a more prudent and realistic approach, which may clarify the way that uncertainty can propagate throughout a modeled or a real system.
Other uncertainties derive from the fast pace and unpredictable directions of future social, economic, political, and technical changes.
The world of the coming century will be different in many ways; unforeseeable developments in other sectors may change the way in which agriculture responds to climate change.
Questions regarding population (i.e., for how many people need the world's agricultural system provide?
) and technological change (can productivity continue to improve?
) are particularly relevant and should be explored with upper and lower bounds of possible projections.
Some effects, such as the flooding of a river or the withering of a crop, come into play only after certain limiting conditions or thresholds have been crossed.
The identification of thresholds in climate change impact research involves analyzing the effects of different levels of climate forcing on an agroecosystem to identify the critical conditions under which the response of crops will abruptly change.
These critical levels can involve either natural or socioeconomic factors, and both should be considered.
For example, in the biophysical domain threshold temperatures have been defined for many specific crop processes, notwithstanding the complexity of interactions among temperature, amount and duration of sunlight, nutrients, and water supply.
Crop models have been developed accordingly to test the combined effects of environmental variables on crop growth and yield.
The critical levels of climatic change that affect crop yields can be identified through computer-based sensitivity tests and crop models.
Results of a crop modeling study that estimated the effects of a 2°C and 4°C temperature rise on yields of wheat, rice, corn, and soybeans are shown in Fig.
3 .
They were derived by first modeling the simulated effect on crop yields for a wide range of latitudes and then applying what was found to current production, nation by nation, to derive a result for the world as a whole.
When only temperature effects were considered, aggregate crop yields showed an ever increasing drop in response to higher temperatures, with loss in yields approximately doubling from the +2 to +4°C cases.
When the direct physiological effects of CO
An even more challenging task is to estimate the probability of coincidental events that might happen in conjunction with global warming, spanning the range between low probability catastrophic events (called "surprises") and higher probability gradual changes in climate and associated environmental effects.
A seemingly small change in one variable--for example, rainfall--may trigger a major unsuspected change in another; for example, droughts or floods might possibly disrupt the transport of grain on rivers.
Moreover, one "surprise" may then lead to another in a cascade, since biophysical and social systems are interconnected.
Computer-aided studies based on what are called complex systems and chaos theory may provide conceptual and analytical tools for anticipating and preparing for surprises, in agriculture as in other systems.
Identifying potential surprises and communicating them to the public and to policy makers may help build the resilience that is needed to anticipate and mitigate harmful effects in timely fashion.
Surprises related to global climate change may be both environmental and societal.
Among the first of these are changes in patterns of atmospheric circulation and precipitation on the seasonal- to-interannual time scale, such as might result from varying patterns of El Niñ o events in the eastern equatorial Pacific.
Such inter- seasonal variations (rather than the very gradual change in long- term averages) are likely to be the climatic effects that farmers actually feel in their year-to-year operations.
Among the second are increases in the migration of people across national borders in consequence of famine.
Such events can be better accommodated if their causes and potential effects are anticipated in advance.
Their study can be aided by efforts to integrate across conventional scientific disciplines, to support a variety of research approaches, and to consider results that lie outside the range of conventional wisdom and experience.
Beyond the theoretical study of environmental surprise, it seems also worthwhile to increase the flexibility of social structures with a view to reducing vulnerability to abrupt perturbations.
Such societal preparedness might include an intentional diversification of productive and technological systems (such as provision for reserve rangeland and supplementary irrigation for the eventuality of drought), the establishment of disaster coping and entitlement systems, and the creation of management systems that are capable of adapting to and learning from surprises.
Adjustments in livestock populations represent one of the first lines of defense against the surprises that can result from short-term fluctuations in crop production.
Agriculture is not a wholly benign actor on the environment, as it causes accelerated soil erosion by water and wind, through cultivation, and often introduces nitrates and other chemicals into water supplies through the application of chemical fertilizers and pesticides.
The concept of "sustainable agriculture" endeavors to reduce chemical inputs and energy use in farming systems, in order to minimize environmental damage and to ensure longer-term productivity.
Most agricultural assessments of global environmental change made to date have not focused explicitly on sustainability issues, and have neglected the considerable impacts of shifting agricultural zones, alterations in commercial fertilizer and pesticide use, and changes in the demand for water resources.
Climate change can impact agricultural sustainability in two interrelated ways: first, by diminishing the long-term ability of agroecosystems to provide food and fiber for the world's population; and second, by inducing shifts in agricultural regions that may encroach upon natural habitats, at the expense of floral and faunal diversity.
Global warming may encourage the expansion of agricultural activities into regions now occupied by natural ecosystems such as forests, particularly at mid- and high-latitudes.
Forced encroachments of this sort may thwart the processes of natural selection of climatically-adapted native crops and other species.
While the overall, global impact of climate change on agricultural production may be small, regional vulnerabilities to food deficits may increase, due to problems of distributing and marketing food to specific regions and groups of people.
For subsistence farmers, and more so for people who now face a shortage of food, lower yields may result not only in measurable economic losses, but also in malnutrition and even famine.
The role of climate as a determinant of agriculture has long been recognized.
It is only in the last decade, however, that the reciprocal effect has come to light: the role of agriculture as a potential contributor to climate change.
Clearing forests for fields, burning crop residues, submerging land in rice paddies, raising large herds of cattle and other ruminants and fertilizing with nitrogen, all release greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.
The main gases emitted are CO
Much research is still needed to understand the processes by which greenhouse gases are emitted from different agricultural practices.
Needed as well are efforts to disseminate the knowledge gained in order to apply it on the farm.
Reductions in some gases are likely to be more easily achievable than in others, and appropriate strategies will vary by region.
The task of reducing emissions will doubtlessly be complicated by accompanying changes in climate variables such as temperature and wind and precipitation, that interact with the processes through which greenhouse gases are released.
The first is the simplistic application of the concept of thresholds to the policy arena: namely, the setting of arbitrary levels for atmospheric trace gas concentrations, emission rates, or temperatures to serve as upper limits of acceptability for policy response.
The term "threshold" is misleading whenever artificially contrived levels are specified rather than natural thresholds.
Proponents of this approach contend that such levels, if generally agreed upon, can serve as quantitative criteria or guideposts for directing national as well as international efforts to contain potentially harmful consequences of the greenhouse effect.
The concept is, in fact, a double-edged sword, since it can be used to either justify or to delay societal action on the issue of global warming.
The shadow side of such a policy is the implication, however unintended, that amounts under the specified levels are harmless, and that the consequences of the enhanced greenhouse effect do not become manifest or significant until these artificial levels are exceeded.
Misconstrued, this concept can give license to continue "business-as-usual," with no need for societal action until the arbitrary level is about to be exceeded.
A more prudent principle, in our view, is the quite plausible assumption that global warming and its manifestations will be in some manner proportionate to the increase of trace gas concentrations and that the eventual consequences of any significant human alteration of the Earth's energy balance is potentially serious.
This principle, were it accepted, would encourage responsible agencies to adopt a policy aimed at reversing current trends rather than implicitly sanctioning the continued enhancement of greenhouse gas emissions until such time as the warming effect becomes clearly evident.
The second notion, which can be equally misleading, is a blind faith in agriculture as a self-correcting process: that through forces of the market and self-preservation farmers can and will readily and fully adapt to climate change as it occurs.
They will certainly make every effort to do so, but the efforts of farmers may well be constrained or even thwarted by factors beyond their control.
In the tropics, inadequate agricultural research, training, and credit now limit the capacity of farmers to adapt to climate change.
In all areas of the world the necessary adjustments (such as substituting crops, introducing or intensifying irrigation, and modifying field operations such as tillage or pest control) may be too costly for many farmers to implement.
Such changes may entail painful social dislocations as well as costly capital investments.
Even for those who can afford such changes, the end result--measured in terms of production and income--will not necessarily compensate for the direct costs involved; heat-tolerant and especially drought-tolerant crops or varieties, for example, will likely have lower yielding potentials.
Moreover, natural ecosystems such as forests may be less adaptable than agricultural systems to rapid change and may therefore prove more vulnerable to climate change with respect to such factors as species dieback and biodiversity.
will be overwhelmingly positive, may lull decision makers and the public at large into complacency regarding global warming and--at the very least--could delay effective action.
Global warming is, in our opinion, a real phenomenon that is likely to engender serious consequences.

A lot of interest has been sparked by a new study, in Geophysical Research Letters, suggesting that warmer oceans could mean fewer hurricanes hitting the United States.
Researchers used past observations to show that increases in sea surface temperature led to increases in vertical wind shear in the region where most Atlantic hurricanes develop.
This coincides with less hurricanes making landfall in the United States ( research abstract ).
More wind shear means embryonic storms get torn apart before they can grow bigger.
“Using data extending back to the middle nineteenth century, we found a gentle decrease in the trend of US landfalling hurricanes when the global ocean is warmed up.
We looked at US landfalling hurricanes because it is the most reliable Atlantic hurricane measurement over the long term,” says study author Chunzai Wang, of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( press release ).
But the AP highlights critics, who have taken aim at the use of landfalling hurricanes.
Kevin Trenberth, climate analysis chief for the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, told the AP that hurricanes hitting land “are not a reliable record” for changes in overall hurricanes, since only a small percentage of storms ever make landfall.
Some previous studies contradict Wang’s new findings, while others support it.
The Seattle Times argues that this new report is “intensifying one of the hottest debates in science”.
The South Florida Sun-Sentinel thinks global warming might be a good thing, “at least as it pertains to hurricanes”.
In the Miami Herald , NOAA researcher Stanley Goldenberg says, “'This study is one more piece of evidence countering the exaggerated claims by a small group of scientists that warming trends in tropical oceans have been contributing to major increases in hurricane activity.”
That's not, however, entirely clear.
There's been a growing consensus that rising sea-surface temperatures might lead to more intense hurricanes - though what it means for the frequency of storms is still an open question.
As one example of how complicated the field is, Nature had a paper in December that found the response to natural climate variations might be larger than greenhouse-gas induced changes.
This is because the latter are uniform while the former tend to involve localized changes, and regions that are warmer than the tropical average seem to have more hurricane potential.
Just to throw one more thing into the mix: an as-yet-unpublished paper on sea temperature and hurricane landfall also suggests that different temperatures don’t increase the landfall rate.
However, modelling in this new study suggests temperature changes can change where hurricanes land.
“The Yucatan suffers 3 times greater landfall rate in hot years than cold, while the U.S. mid-Atlantic coast exhibits no significant change,” say the researchers.
The link between changes in the temperature of the sea’s surface and increases in North Atlantic hurricane activity has been quantified for the first time.
The research - carried out by scientists at UCL (University College London) and due to be published in Nature on January 31 - shows that a 0.5°C increase in sea surface temperature can be associated with a ~40 per cent increase in hurricane activity.
The study, conducted by Professor Mark Saunders and Dr Adam Lea of the Benfield UCL Hazard Research Centre and the UCL Tropical Storm Risk forecasting venture, finds that local sea surface warming was responsible for about 40 per cent of the increase in Atlantic hurricane activity (relative to the 1950-2000 average) between 1996 and 2005.
The study also finds that the current sensitivity of tropical Atlantic hurricane activity to sea surface warming is large, with a 0.5°C increase in sea surface temperature being associated with a ~40 per cent increase in hurricane activity and frequency.
The research focuses on storms that form in the tropical North Atlantic, Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico – a region which produced nearly 90 per cent of the hurricanes that reached the United States between 1950 and 2005.
To quantify the role of sea warming it was necessary to first understand the separate contributions of atmospheric circulation and sea surface temperature to the increase in hurricane frequency and activity.
Professor Saunders, the lead author of the study, explained how this was done.
“We created a statistical model based on two environmental variables – local sea surface temperature and an atmospheric wind field - which replicated 75-80 per cent of the variance in tropical Atlantic hurricane activity and frequency between 1965 and 2005.
By removing the influence of winds from the model we were able to assess the contribution of sea surface temperature and found that it has a large effect.
“
“Our analysis does not identify whether greenhouse gas-induced warming contributed to the increase in water temperature and thus to the increase in hurricane activity.
However, it is important that climate models are able to reproduce the observed relationship between hurricane activity and sea surface temperature so that we can have confidence in their reliability to project how hurricane activity will respond to future climate change.”

Greenland Ice Core Reveals History Of Pollution In The Arctic
ScienceDaily (Aug. 20, 2008) — Coal burning, primarily in North America and Europe, contaminated the Arctic and potentially affected human health and ecosystems in and around Earth's polar regions, according to new research.
The study was conducted by the Desert Research Institute (DRI), Reno, Nev. and partially funded by the National Science Foundation.
Detailed measurements from a Greenland ice core showed pollutants from burning coal--the toxic heavy metals cadmium, thallium and lead--were much higher than expected.
The catch, however, was the pollutants weren't higher at the times when researchers expected peaks.
"Conventional wisdom held that toxic heavy metals were higher in the 1960s and ‘70s, the peak of industrial activity in Europe and North America and certainly before implementation of Clean Air Act controls in the early 1970s," said Joe McConnell, lead researcher and director of DRI's Ultra-Trace Chemistry Laboratory.
"But it turns out pollution in southern Greenland was higher 100 years ago when North American and European economies ran on coal, before the advent of cleaner, more efficient coal burning technologies and the switch to oil and gas-based economies," McConnell said.
In fact, the research showed pollutants were two to five times higher at the beginning of the previous century than today.
Pollution levels in the early 1900s also represented a 10-fold increase from preindustrial levels.
Continuous, monthly and annually averaged pollution records taken from the Greenland ice core dating from 1772-2003 produced the results.
And although data showed heavy-metal pollution in the North Atlantic sector of the Arctic is substantially lower today than a century ago, McConnell and his research partner, Ross Edwards, an associate research professor at DRI, said there is still cause for concern.
"Contamination of other sectors may be increasing because of the rapid coal-driven growth of Asian economies," they wrote in the report.
They argued the consequence may be greater risk to the food chain as toxic heavy metals from industrial activities in Asian nations are transported through the atmosphere and deposited in the polar regions.
Food chain contamination through toxic metal absorption from both the environment and from consumption of contaminated food sources could make its way to humans, who feed on long-lived land and marine animals such as caribou, seals and whale.

With developed and developing nations seemingly at loggerheads over transitioning from a path of increasing CO2 emissions and accelerating climate change to a path of decreasing emissions and climate protection, Climate Institute chief scientist Dr. Michael MacCracken has suggested a path forward that, while requiring all nations to act aggressively, recognizes important issues of equity and fairness.
Speaking June 25 before an audience of over 800 in Portland, Oregon at the annual meeting of the Air and Waste Management Association (AWMA), Dr. MacCracken reviewed the underlying science of climate change, described the need for strong early action, and offered a nuanced strategy for equitably parceling out responsibilities for emissions cutbacks.
If implemented, this strategy would be likely to ensure the Earth avoids the level of warming that the European Union has recognized as very likely to exceed climatic tipping points that would cause “dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.”
Dr. MacCracken’s summary paper, Prospects for Future Climate Change and the
Reasons for Early Action, which focuses on the proposed emissions control strategy, was published in the June 2008 issue of em: The Magazine for Environmental Professionals (PDF).
A lengthier paper, reviewing the science of climate change based on his four decades of studying and researching the issue of climate change, is published in the June 2008 issue of the Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association (PDF).
This second article offers an easily understandable summary of the science and impacts of climate change, indicating both what is well understood and what is troubling the scientists—especially those aspects that might indicate that, as has been the case in the past, the scientific community is underestimating the seriousness of the issue.
In addition to reviewing the scientific evidence of accelerating rates of climate change and sea level rise and the implications for humanity and other life on Earth, Dr. MacCracken argues that avoiding the most catastrophic potential aspects of climate change will require reducing emissions sharply by 2050 and to near zero by 2100.
To accomplish this difficult challenge, he proposes a reciprocal arrangement under which "(1) developed nations move rapidly to demonstrate that a modern society can function without reliance on technologies that release carbon dioxide (CO2) and other non-CO2 greenhouse gases to the atmosphere; and (2) … developing nations act in the near-term to sharply limit their non-CO2 emissions while minimizing growth in CO2 emissions, and then in the long-term join with the developed nations to reduce all emissions as cost effective technologies are developed.” Under this approach developing nations at the outset would focus on low hanging fruit--emissions reductions with significant ability to limit radiative forcing and that are achievable at low relative cost.
These include greatly reducing emissions of methane, air pollutants that contribute to tropospheric ozone, and black soot, which blackens glaciers, in turn causing greater absorption of solar radiation and melting of glaciers that are crucial to the water supply of a large portion of humanity.
Initially, the primary efforts to limit CO2 emissions in developing nations would focus on ending deforestation and on implementing energy efficiency measures--e.g.
reducing power consumption for lighting, reducing conversion loss and transmission loss, and encouraging energy recycling including combined heat and power.

Dr. MacCracken, Chief Scientist for Climate Change Programs of the Climate Institute since 2002, has played a crucial role in the development of both scientific and public understanding of implications of climate change.
Before joining the Climate Institute, he served as executive director of the National Assessment Coordination Office, which facilitated preparation of the US National Assessment of Climate Change published in 2000 .
He also played an important role in both the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment published in 2004 (Synthesis Report) and the Special Experts Group report prepared in 2007 under the auspices of Sigma Xi and the UN Foundation for the UN Commission on Sustainable Development, and titled: Confronting Climate Change: Avoiding the Unmanageable and Managing the Unavoidable .
From 2003 to 2007 Dr. MacCracken served as President of the International Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric Sciences .
In addition, Dr. MacCracken’s Affidavit on behalf of the plaintiffs was cited by Justice Stevens in the Majority Opinion of the United States Supreme Court in Massachusetts v. EPA .
Honoring the 20th Anniversary of the founding of the Climate Institute, Dr. MacCracken organized the September 19, 2006 scientific symposium at the Washington Summit on Climate Stabilization and was the lead editor of the resulting book, Sudden and Disruptive Climate Change: Exploring the Real Risks and How We Can Avoid Them .
ICAP , An international coalition has "announced the formation of the International Carbon Action Partnership to fight global warming.

ICAP's founding membership includes, among others, New Jersey, California, New York, the European Commission, New Zealand, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom.
They have come together to attempt to forge the foundations for a truly global carbon market structure.
The belief is that a post-Kyoto agreement will necessitate this international financial architecture and so those who are interested in setting up or furthering cap-and-trade regimes are clearing a path now.

WASHINGTON (June 11, 2007) – The mounting quest for oil alternatives threatens drastic increases in heat-trapping global warming pollution and severe impacts on popular habitats across the United States and Western Canada unless clear safeguards are adopted quickly, according to a new analysis released today by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC).
The warning comes as lawmakers are facing growing pressure to give huge new subsidies and other incentives to companies involved in liquid coal, oil shale and tar sands.
Western Resources Advocates (WRA), a group active on the oil shale issue in the American west, joined NRDC in authoring the report, as did the Pembina Institute, a Canadian energy and climate change research organization based in Alberta.
All three groups are calling for a better path forward through increased fuel efficiency, and the use of renewable, cleaner fuels.
The report, Driving It Home , is available online.
Liquid coal poses disastrous consequences for global warming and local environments, according to the report.
The energy required in the production stage of liquid coal would mean twice as much global warming pollution as ordinary gasoline.
Mining would tear through natural habitats and contribute to air pollution.
Displacing just 10 percent of our total oil demand with liquid coal would require a doubling in coal mining and the construction of hundreds of costly new production facilities – each with its own emissions issues.
To get at tar sands, companies use huge amounts of natural gas – enough to heat 4 million homes last year alone – to generate steam that is pumped deep under ground.
In other cases, vast open pit mines are used to dig the material out.
Either way, the industrial mix of roads, pipelines, pits and heavy equipment cause irreparable damage across the rare and irreplaceable habitats of Canada’s vast Boreal Forest, home to more than 40 percent of North America’s waterfowl.
Toxic tailings threaten regional water supplies.
From start to finish the process generates three times the global warming emissions of conventional gasoline.
Emissions from tar sands production totaled 125 million tons in 2003.
Extracting oil from shale involves heating the stone to 900 degrees F. This used to be done after mining hundreds of tons shale.
Now companies are experimenting with heating it in place, creating a horizontal river of boiling oil deep below the ground.
A 2005 study by the RAND Corporation estimates it would require a 1200-megawatt power plant just to unlock just 100,000 barrels of shale oil a day (less than 1 percent of our total oil demand).
Large enough to serve half a million people, the power plant alone would burn 5 million tons of coal each year and release 10 million tons of global warming pollution.
Several banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and HSBC, are already encouraging their clients to address global warming through mechanisms such as carbon mitigation plans and carbon reporting.
The United States is likely to pass a regulatory framework to cap global warming pollution in the near future.
Tar sands, oil shale and liquid coal all result in higher global warming pollution emissions.
The already high cost of these fuels would further increase significantly with the need to move in the opposite direction and reduce emissions in a carbon-constrained economy.
The authors urge investors to take these financial risks into consideration.
In the report, NRDC, WRA and the Pembina Institute offer an environmentally and economically sound path forward to meet our future transportation fuel needs without the use of unconventional fuel sources.
This path includes moderating demand, increasing energy efficiency and commercializing clean and renewable fuels.
The Natural Resources Defense Council is a national, nonprofit organization of scientists, lawyers and environmental specialists dedicated to protecting public health and the environment.
Founded in 1970, NRDC has 1.3 million members and online activists, served from offices in New York, Washington, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Beijing.
Not only is the planet heating up, but, as we've seen here, so is the intensity and the seriousness of the debate on how to get GHG's down.
One persistent theme is the necessity of "setting a price on carbon.
" We've heard this from the Stern Review , the IPCC , Lehman Brothers in their reports on the Business of Climate Change , and numerous economists.
The US Senate will shortly begin debate , as early as next week , on a vehicle for a comprehensive federal approach, with a cap-and-trade system at its core.
(See A Summary of the Boxer Substitute Amendment To the Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act and this look at the state of legislation in Congress from the Pew Center on Global Climate Change.
) Realistically, nobody expects a bill to be passed by this Congress and signed into law by this President.
However, the lessons we will learn as legislation progresses this year in Congress will serve as the foundation for the law that will emerge from the next Congress and that will be signed by the next President.
Beyond an American cap-and-trade regime, of course, there is the international agreement that will be finalized in December of 2009 in Copenhagen.
So, as the pace quickens over the next few months and into next year, there will be more and more analysis emerging from various worthy think tanks and other keepers of the policy flames.
Here, for instance, is a paper on " Economic Incentives in a New Climate Agreement " from Harvard's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs .
The paper looks at the " potential use of market-based or economic-incentive instruments to ensure that polluters face direct cost incentives to mitigate emissions at the lowest possible cost.
The first section describes various economic-incentive policy instruments and the second section discusses their potential application in the design of an international climate policy agreement.
" This is the language that the international negotiators on the post-Kyoto agreement are speaking.
(For more on their activities, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change has comprehensive coverage.
) The Belfer Center paper is a good, digestible look at some of the basics of where we're going.
"Policy Innovations," a Carnegie Council online magazine, has this recent take: Can Green Trade Tariffs Combat Climate Change?
The federal legislation under consideration "would also levy punitive tariffs on greenhouse-gas-intensive products imported from countries that lack comparable action' to that of the United States, starting in 2020.
Industrial lobbies and labor unions are pushing hard for these sanctions to take effect more quickly.
" So, this is not just some wonks pushing ideas around in space any longer.
This could become one of the keystones of an American approach to the global crisis.
And not just American.
The Carnegie Council article reports that "European Commission President José Manuel Barroso, French President Nicolas Sarkozy, and industrial chambers of commerce strongly advocate a similar tariff system, leading many analysts to predict that the EU will also adopt some sort of green tariff system in the next few years.
"
I recently added this site to the links section here.
It's a pretty extraordinary tool for accessing information.
It is described as "a knowledge management project for international negotiations and related activities on climate change run by the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD).
Use it in good health.
California Standards - Several months back, the EPA denied California’s request to implement its landmark law limiting global warming pollution from new automobiles.
I wrote here about the lawsuit that ensued, filed by California and other states and several environmental organizations.
EDF’s general counsel said at the time: “The agency’s decision defies the law, the science and the will of states representing nearly half of the U.S. population.”
California Congressman Henry Waxman’s House Oversight and Government Affairs Committee found recently that the White House had influenced the decision by EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson for political reasons, a clear violation of the ex parte arrangement for EPA decisions of this type.
Waxman had Johnson before the committee this week and it was, by all reports, not too pretty.
See EPA Chief Silent on White House Involvement in Key Decisions from the Environment News Service.
This follows on the report from the committee from December in which they found, as their release was entitled, the White House Engaged in Systematic Effort to Manipulate Climate Change Science .
Wednesday, the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works voted to instruct the administration to sign the waiver allowing the California rule.
See this release from the Committee in which California Senator Dianne Feinstein says: “The time has come to take the decision on California’s waiver out of the hands of the EPA.
The senior leadership of the EPA has failed to demonstrate that it has the integrity or independence to make decisions based on sound science.” David Doniger, NRDC’s Climate Center Policy Director, said here : “The landmark standards adopted by California and 17 other states will be the single most important step taken so far to curb the heat-trapping pollution that causes global warming.
One way or the other , through this new law, a court case, or a new decision by the next president , Americans will soon have cleaner cars as required by California’s clean cars law.”
Christians and Global Warming - Christians Launch Campaign against Global Warming Hype is the story from “The Christian Post.” “The “ We Get It!
‘ declaration, which currently has nearly 100 signers, is backed by prominent Christians including Tony Perkins of Family Research Council, Dr. James Dobson of Focus on the Family, award-winning radio host Janet Parshall, and U.S. Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma.” (The title of their initiative is obviously a play on Al Gore’s ambitious new project: The We Campaign .
)
Jim Inhofe, you will remember, is the leader of the Republican minority on the Environment & Public Works Committee, its former chair, and an ardent opponent of even acknowledging the reality of climate change.
The other story that I want to flag for you concerns the very public spat between elements of the Evangelical Christian community in the U.S. One recent focus of the contention has been the very active campaign waged against global warming by Richard Cizik, the vice president for governmental affairs of the National Association of Evangelicals.
The NAE, for your information, is an umbrella group, with hundreds of organizational members, and represents on the order of 30 million Americans.
See “ NAE rebuffs critics, affirming Cizik and a wider agenda ” from “The Christian Century.” (Bill McKibben is another featured writer for them.
) The NAE has an active “Creation Care” initiative.
You can hear Cizik talk about that here at NPR .
You might also check out the Evangelical Climate Initiative .
It’s being led by some pretty heavy hitters out there, among them Rick Warren, Jim Wallis, Leith Anderson, and former New York City congressman Floyd Flake.
For another take on this, see Creation Care Leaders Join National Campaign to Protect Wildlife Threatened by Global Warming .
“Faith leaders are joining together with science, art, and justice groups in a national campaign to protect plants and animals threatened by global warming.” To see the partners in the campaign and their projects, go to Irreplaceable - Wildlife in a Warming World .
Cap-and-Trade Bonanza , "Fortune" has a Sustainability column authored by Marc Gunther and this week he's got a story on how we're going to divvy up the proceeds from the inevitable U.S. cap-and-trade program that will be on the books sometime in 2009.
See A $3 trillion climate change battle .
As Gunther writes, "The issue gets pretty wonky pretty quickly, but it's worth trying to understand because the stakes are so high.
" The question is who will get the money raised by the permits issued.
That's the much-more-than-$64,000 question.
Should it go to the taxpayers, the industries effected in the form of some rebate, to help fund renewable energy investments, and/or any of a number of other constituencies and projects?
This will be a big part of the debate as this legislation wends its way through Congress, and in the early days of the next administration.
(As we learned in the last post below, the next President of the United States, whomever he or she will be, will be on board for some sort of cap-and-trade regime.
)
New Study Pinpoints Thousands of Climate Change Impacts , "Nature," one of the oldest, most revered, and most definitive science journals, published a paper this week, Attributing physical and biological impacts to anthropogenic climate change , from key scientists who were involved with last year's landmark Fourth Assessment Report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
"Nature's" superb blog, "Climate Feedback," said here that "Nearly 30,000 phenomena in the natural world - from the timing of plant flowering to the rate of ice melting - are being influenced by human-induced global warming, according to the first study to formally link trends in biological and physical systems to rising greenhouse gas emissions.
" Here's the story from NASA where the lead author, Cynthia Rosenzweig of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Science, has her day job.
Anyway, the first compelling story here is New DOE Report Analyzes a Path to 20% Wind Power by 2030.
This means the US would move from its current generating capacity of 16.8 gigawatts to 304 GW in 2030.
It would also mean we'd achieve an annual reduction of 825 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions in 2030.
The report further calculates "the accelerated wind power effort would support roughly 500,000 U.S. jobs and add more than $1.5 billion in annual revenues to the coffers of local communities.
" Go to the "20% Wind Energy by 2030" program website for more.
However, even though it appeared as of my post from last month, Tax Breaks, Finally, for Renewables , that the deal was done and the extension of tax credits for the renewables industries was at hand, it appears to be not quite yet the case.
The AWEA and her sister renewable energy industry trade groups are still pitching.
See this release .
We're getting close though.
See this from Reuters' today: Renewable Energy Tax Bill Advances In US House .
The big news came from John McCain on Monday.
McCain Pledges To Combat Climate Change is the story from Reuters' "Planet Ark" service.
In an obvious attempt to delineate the difference between President Bush and himself, he said "I will not shirk the mantle of leadership that the United States bears.
I will not permit eight long years to pass without serious action on serious challenges.
"
McCain's speech was thoughtful too about the problem of getting China and India on board.
He said: "In my approach to global climate-control efforts, we will apply the principle of equal treatment.
We will apply the same environmental standards to industries in China, India, and elsewhere that we apply to our own industries.
And if industrializing countries seek an economic advantage by evading those standards, I would work with the European Union and other like-minded governments that plan to address the global warming problem to develop effective diplomacy, effect a transfer of technology, or other means to engage those countries that decline to enact a similar cap.
"
For a good, well-rounded look at McCain's position and history on climate change, and the positions of the other two candidates remaining, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, look at this item from "The Online NewsHour.
" (For more on cap-and-trade and other stories related to the carbon markets, you can see these posts .
)
This documentary is moving, eloquent, visceral.
We had the great fortune to have the director, David Novack, in my class on climate change a couple of weeks ago.
David is, not surprisingly, not unlike his film: low-key, intelligent and passionate.
He told us about a number of ins and outs, including the linguistic detoxification of fill by the Corps of Engineers that now allows the previously banned practice of using waste to fill in waterways.
The mountaintop debris that has been blown away by thousands of pounds of ANFO to expose the coal seams for easy extraction is no longer waste , it's just earth.
"War is Peace" as they might say in 1984.
Well, some folks in Congress have noticed this bit of jiggery pokery and have offered the " Clean Water Protection Act " as a remedy.
It defines "fill material" to mean "any pollutant that replaces portions of waters of the United States with dry land or that changes the bottom elevation of a water body for any purpose and to exclude any pollutant discharged into the water primarily to dispose of waste.
"
We also talked a bit about the fact that, as Big Coal , the magisterial treatise by Jeff Goodell from 2006, points out, West Virginia, just like some other places, Nigeria and the Congo, for instance, is a place where economists have demonstrated a "clear negative relationship between natural-resource based exports" and economic growth.
This phenomenon is called the "resource curse.
"
Some exciting announcements today from the White House on our efforts to combat climate change and lay the foundation for a clean energy economy!
The President will be attending the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen (COP 15) next month, and he will take with him an emissions reduction target to drive progress toward a comprehensive and operational Copenhagen accord.
Over the last 10 months, the Administration, under the President’s active leadership, has made remarkable progress in addressing climate change and accelerating a clean energy renaissance domestically and abroad (see a list of accomplishments below).
These aggressive initiatives have laid the foundation for a meaningful agreement in Copenhagen and longer term for a new, sustainable and prosperous clean energy future.
The international climate summit will bring together delegations from 192 nations and will be visited by approximately 15,000 people.
For the first time in the series of these conferences, the U.S. delegation will have a U.S. Center, providing a unique and interactive forum to share our story with the world.
The Center will host over 70 events during the two-week conference that will highlight the strong actions the U.S. is taking at home as well as the leadership role the U.S. is pursuing internationally to combat global climate change.
Activities in the Center will include a series of presentations by senior Cabinet and Administration officials including: Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, Commerce Secretary Gary Locke, Energy Secretary Steven Chu, and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa P. Jackson, along with Council on Environmental Quality Chair Nancy Sutley, Office of Science and Technology Policy Director John Holdren, and Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change Carol Browner.
Topics will range from energy efficiency investments and global commitments to renewables policy and clean energy jobs.
These are definitely exciting times as we work collectively to address the challenge of climate change and advance the opportunities of a new clean energy future.
Highlights of actions and accomplishments on climate change and energy by the Obama Administration in the last 10 months.
Advancing Comprehensive Energy Legislation : Passing comprehensive energy and climate legislation is a top priority for the Administration and significant progress has been made.
In June, The U.S. House of Representatives passed the American Clean Energy and Security Act that will promote clean energy investments and lower U.S. greenhouse gas emissions more than 80 percent by 2050.
The Senate continues to advance their efforts to pass comprehensive legislation and move the U.S. closer to a system of clean energy incentives that create new energy jobs, reduce our dependence on oil, and cut pollution.
Offshore Energy Development : Within the Administration’s first 100 days, a new regulatory framework was established to facilitate the development of alternative energy projects in an economic and environmentally sound manner that allows us to tap into the vast energy potential of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS).
The National Renewable Energy Lab estimates that development of wind energy alone on the OCS may provide an additional 1,900 gigawatts of clean energy to the U.S.
The Major Economies Forum (MEF) : President Obama launched the MEF in March 2009, creating a new dialogue among developed and emerging economies to combat climate change and promote clean energy.
At the July L’Aquila summit, MEF Leaders announced important new agreements to support the UN climate talks and launched a new Global Partnership to promote clean energy technologies.
Bilateral Energy and Climate Partnerships: The U.S. is accelerating its collaboration with China , India , Mexico , Canada and other key international partners to combat climate change, coordinate clean energy research and development, and support the international climate talks.
Energy and Climate Partnership for the Americas : President Obama proposed a partnership with our neighbors in the western hemisphere to advance energy security and combat climate change.
An early product of this cooperation is Chile’s Renewable Energy Center, which receives technical support from the U.S. Department of Energy.
Heather Zichal is Deputy Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change
Other international standards are set by the Organization for International Standardization (ISO).
The ISO has begun to establish international Environmental Management standards in its 14000 series.
The first standard among them (ISO 14001, Environmental Management Standard or EMS) was published in 1996 (ISO, 1996).
ISO environmental standards are framework standards and do not set any performance standards.
They are flexible to facilitate application by a wide variety of organizations throughout the world.
An organization can select any environmental aspects (such as emissions to air and/or water, ozone depletion, climate change, etc.
) it considers important for its activities.
This means that the standards may be effective as tools to cope with global warming if they are utilized for that purpose.
In December 1997, the Climate Technology Initiative (CTI) of the OECD and the ISO issued a Joint Statement concerning the potential contribution of international standards to climate change (ISO, 1998a).
In 1998, ISO established a Climate Technology Task Force to review the application of the ISO 14000 series to climate change (ISO, 1998b).
In January 2000, ISO’s Technical Management Board established an Ad Hoc Group on Climate Change (AHGCC) to develop a comprehensive ISO strategy for climate change.
While ISO has not ratified a climate change strategy, the AHGCC has identified several areas in which the development and use of ISO standards may help facilitate implementation of the UNFCCC and its Kyoto Protocol, including (among others):
Several voluntary initiatives that have an international impact have been identified.
For instance, various multinational firms have undertaken voluntary actions to cope with climate change, including setting up emissions trading systems and engaging in trades.
The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) Statement by Financial Institutions on the Environment and Sustainable Development and the UNEP Insurance Initiative may be classified as international VAs.
Banks and insurance companies that sign these initiatives have to pay attention to environmental protection in their management and in their product selections and operations.
These initiatives are not binding and no monitoring of conduct has been carried out.
In addition, the territorial distribution of the signing banks and insurance companies is uneven; participation from developing countries and the USA is rare, and no Japanese banks signed the Financial Institutions Initiative.
Some domestic VAs may evolve as de facto international VAs.
The Energy Star programme began in 1992 as a voluntary partnership between the US DOE, the US Environmental Protection Agency, product manufacturers, and others.
Partners promote energy efficient products by labelling them with the Energy Star logo and educating consumers about the benefits of energy efficiency.
- Carbon capture and storage involves trapping carbon-dioxide emissions from coal or gas-fired power stations and storing them underground.
Disused oil and gas wells are the most cost-effective places for storing the CO2.
- Carbon-capture technology involves passing flue gases from power stations through chemical solvents to remove the carbon dioxide.
The removed gas is then compressed to liquify it, and sent by pipeline to oil or gas rigs.
There, it is pumped underground into strata once filled with the fossil fuels.
- Carbon capture and storage is regarded as an important measure to limit climate change.
It has the potential to remove 90 per cent of the CO2 produced by power stations, which would effectively make the largest contributor to greenhouse gases carbon-neutral.
- Once underground, the carbon dissolves in salt water (saline aquifer) over hundreds of years without causing harm to the atmosphere.
- Norway has been running a pilot sequestration project at the Sleipner field since 1996 in which more than a million tonnes of carbon dioxide have been pumped into empty oil strata in a stable and sustainable fashion.
- There have been environmental concerns that carbon dioxide stored in this way might not be stable, and might yet be released suddenly into the atmosphere, but most geologists consider the technique safe and practical.
- At present carbon-capture technologies are hugely energy-intensive putting their financial viability in doubt.
Shell and StatoilHydro recently scrapped plans to build a green power plant that would capture and store carbon dioxide because the project was found to be uneconomic.
- Cutting carbon emissions is immensely politically sensitive for a country such as the United States.
It emits the equivalent of 20 tons of CO2 every year for each person living there, double the amount emitted per capita in Britain and 20 times greater than in Mozambique.
So if America is to take serious action on climate change, its citizens have a lot more to lose than most.
- Britain's obligation under Kyoto was to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 12.5% by 2012, compared with 1990 levels.
It has already managed 13.5%.
Britain's Climate Change Bill has fixed on a 60% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, but many scientists now believe that an 80% cut is required.
The Copenhagen treaty expected in two years' time will probably demand that Britain cut its emissions by 25% by 2020.
Delegates meeting at the U.N. climate conference in Bali agreed to include forest conservation in future discussions on a new global warming treaty, reports the Associated Press.
The move could lead to the transfer of billions of dollars — in the form of carbon credits — from industrialized countries to tropical nations for the purpose of slowing greenhouse gas emissions by reducing deforestation rates.
Deforestation presently accounts for roughly 20 percent of anthropogenic emissions worldwide.
While controversial, the program, known as Reducing Emissions From Deforestation and Degradation (REDD), has been widely seen by scientists and environmentalists as a way to address environmental degradation by assigning value to intact ecosystems like rainforests and peat swamps.
"[REDD has] the potential to shift the balance of underlying economic market forces that currently favor deforestation, by raising billions of dollars for the ecosystem services provided by rainforest regions," wrote a team of scientists in a paper published in Science last month.
Clearly, our rhetorical understanding of how to approach climate discussions has focused on an elementary binary decision tree where either "I win, you lose" or "I lose, you win".
This has been the US position for quite some time and led one esteemed delegate to describe this US administration as "the most fact averse in US history".
So even with partial success in Bali, I am not celebrating because the rhetoric around climate change hasn't changed.
The developing nations want to be paid to protect their forests and the developed nations want the developing nations to curb their emissions growth.
It is a no-win situation globally because there is a distinct lack of accountability.
There are no statutory emissions targets.
I am gently suggesting that our rhetoric around climate change optimize to exhibit generativeness and a will to develop solutions together.
Researchers, together with the UK government's 2005 Stern Review, say that forest protection could be one of the most cost-effective ways to address climate change.
"Conserving tropical forests could ultimately be one of the cheapest ways we have available to slow global warming," said Dr. William Laurance, a biologist with the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute who has co-authored several papers on REDD.
"The costs of forest conservation are modest and deforestation is a massive source of emissions, so slowing deforestation is like plucking the low-hanging fruit — there's a lot of benefit for not a lot of cost.
And of course we're not just storing carbon; we're also saving the world's most biologically important real estate, providing a place for local and indigenous peoples, and helping to stabilize delicate soils and reduce catastrophic flooding.
"
Delegates at Bali apparently agreed, recommending that efforts to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation should be "strengthened and supported" but stopping short of calling for anything other than voluntary action on REDD.
REDD still faces many challenges, especially in implementation.
Issues range from "permanence" (whether a county can ensure that forest carbon savings are permanent) to "leakage" (what happens when carbon conservation in one area drives deforestation in another?
) to baseline data establishment (how does one measure historic deforestation to establish a baseline for calculating reduction?).
Further questions over land rights (will REDD trigger a land rush by industrial agriculture giants and forestry firms?
) as well as how local communities will benefit (the cost of registering and establishing a REDD project may top $50,000, a nearly insurmountable sum for communities and small-scale forest holders in some of the world's poorest countries) are also valid.
There is also ongoing squabbling between a coalition of forest nations and Brazil, which sees REDD as an attempt to limit its economic development of the Amazon rainforest.
Some forest-rich countries that have low deforestation rates have expressed concern they will be left out of the process since their forests are not under immediate threat.
(12/8/2007) Three governors have signed the Forests Now Declaration to protect tropical forests for their carbon value.
The Governors, Irwandi Yusuf (Aceh, Indonesia), Barnabas Suebu (Papua, Indonesia), and Eduardo Braga (Amazonas, Brazil), agreed to the declaration's action plan which calls for compensation for reduced greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and protection of standing forests.
Deforestation and forest degradation account for roughly 20 percent of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, but steps to reduce forest loss will help mitigate climate change.
The UK government's 2005 Stern Review said that forest protection could be one of the most cost-effective ways to address climate change.
(12/6/2007) Merrill Lynch is working with Carbon Conservation, an ecosystem services firms, to explore opportunities in avoided deforestation and integrated sustainable land management.
The partnership was announced Thursday in Bali, Indonesia, where more than 10,000 policymakers, scientists, and activists are meeting to discuss a post-Kyoto framework on limiting climate change.
(12/4/2007) The Amazon rainforest could play a major part in reducing greenhouse gas emissions that result from deforestation, reports a new study published by scientists at the Woods Hole Research Center, the Instituto de Pesquisa Ambiental da Amazônia, and the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais.
At a carbon price of $3 per ton, protecting the Amazon for its carbon value could outweigh the opportunity costs of forgoing logging, cattle ranching, and soy expansion in the region.
2008 certified emission-reduction credits for carbon currently trade at more than $90 per ton ($25 per ton of CO2).
(12/4/2007) A proposal to pay the Democratic of Congo (DRC) for reducing deforestation could add 15-50 percent to the amount of international aid given to the warn-torn country, reports a new study published by scientists at the Woods Hole Research Center (WHRC).
The funds would help alleviate rural poverty while cutting emissions of greenhouse gases and protecting threatened biodiversity.
(11/29/2007) The global carbon market could play a key role in saving the Amazon from the effects of climate change and economic development, which could otherwise trigger dramatic ecological changes, reports a new paper published in Science.
The authors argue that a well-articulated plan, financed by carbon markets, could prevent the worst outcomes for the Amazon forest while generating economic benefits for the region's inhabitants.
(11/27/2007) While environmentalists, scientists, development exports, and policymakers across the political spectrum are ethusiastic about the idea of offsetting carbon emissions by preventing deforestation (a concept known as "avoided deforestation" or Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD)), the concept still faces many challenges, especially in implementation.
(11/21/2007) Conversion of forests and peatlands for agriculture in Indonesia has generated little economic benefit while releasing substantial amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, reports a new study from the the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF), the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) and their Indonesian partners.
(10/17/2007) After a steep drop in deforestation rates since 2004, widespread fires in the Brazilian Amazon (September and October 2007) suggest that forest clearing may increase this year.
All told, since 2000 Brazil has lost more than 60,000 square miles (150,000 square kilometers) of rainforest -- an area larger than the state of Georgia or the country of Bangladesh.
Most of this destruction has been driven by clearing for cattle pasture and agriculture, often in association with infrastructure development and improvements.
Higher commodity prices, especially for beef and soy, have further spurred forest conversion in the region.
While drivers of Amazon deforestation are stronger than ever, mounting concerns over climate change and the effort to reign in greenhouse gas emissions may provide new economic incentives for landowners to preserve forest lands through a concept known as "avoided deforestation".
Acknowledging the contribution of the emissions from deforestation to global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions,
Acknowledging that forest degradation also leads to emissions, and needs to be addressed when reducing emissions from deforestation,
Recognizing that efforts and actions to reduce deforestation and to maintain and conserve forest carbon stocks in developing countries are already being taken,
Recognizing the complexity of the problem, different national circumstances and the multiple drivers of deforestation and forest degradation,
Recognizing the potential role of further actions to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries in helping to meet the ultimate objective of the Convention,
Affirming the urgent need to take further meaningful action to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries,
Noting that sustainable reduction in emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries requires stable and predictable availability of resources,
Recognizing that reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries can promote co-benefits and may complement the aims and objectives of other relevant international conventions and agreements,
Recognizing also that the needs of local and indigenous communities should be addressed when action is taken to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries,

The Long Summer: How Climate Changed Civilization [Illustrated] [Hardcover]
A professor of anthropology by training, Brian Fagan traces the effects of climate change on civilisation over the past 15,000 years--a period of prolonged global warming that has accelerated in the past 150 years.
In particular, he's interested in how civilisations have responded to, or been radically altered by, changes in environment.
One of Fagan's most compelling examples is a detailed history of the city of Ur in what is now Iraq.
Once a great city in one of the world's earliest civilisations, it first thrived thanks to abundant rainfall and then suffered severely when the Indian Ocean monsoons shifted southward, changing rain patterns.
By 2000 BC its agricultural economy had collapsed, and today it is an abandoned landscape, an assemblage of decaying shrines in the harshest of deserts.
Fagan views this event as pivotal.
It was, he writes, "the first time an entire city disintegrated in the face of environmental catastrophe".
But it wasn't the last: in his epilogue, which covers the last 800 years of human history, Fagan explores the climatic upheavals that left 20 million dead in famine-related epidemics in the 19th century.
He notes that today 200 million people barely survive on marginal agricultural land in places such as northeastern Brazil, Ethiopia and the Saharan Sahel.
If temperatures rise much above current levels and rising seas flood coastal plains, the devastation could dwarf any disaster mankind has previously known.
Fagan doesn't offer easy solutions, but he presents a compelling history of climate's role in the background--and sometimes foreground--of human history.

5.0 out of 5 stars Drowning and drought,
This review is from: The Long Summer: How Climate Changed Civilization (Hardcover)
Anyone still believing scientists lack a sense of humanity should read this.
Although the title suggests yet another climate study, this isn't a simple analysis of our weather systems.
Fagan places the human condition at the centre of his narrative.
It's not enough to present more evidence of global warming.
In fact, he's adamant about the causes of current climate change being a "side debate".
He's much more concerned about how many climate shifts humanity has experienced and how we reacted to them.
His theme is our adaptability to weather changes in the past and whether we can garner lessons for the future.
Establishing a scenario beginning twenty thousand years ago, Fagan lines out three Acts for the peopling of the Americas.
The first is in "the primodial homeland", Ice Age Siberia, followed by conditions revealed about the Beringian Land Bridge of fifteen thousand years ago.
The final act takes us to the chaotic Atlantic and the European environment.
Conditions were rarely stable as "the glaciers were never still".
Their "irregular dance" kept conditions variable and human response was adapt or perish.
Canadian fresh meltwater interrupted the Gulf Stream letting harsh cold envelope Europe.
Human adaptibility often meant improvements on older technologies or innovative ones to cope with the result of climate change.
Spears, later with atlatls - "spear throwers" to improve range and accuracy, then bows, were significant tools.
Yet, one of the most momentous inventions was the needle - still in use almost unchanged today.
This device could produce layered clothing, a major adaptive step in times of abrupt weather changes.
Weather changes can be due to single events - even those occurring at intervals like El Nino.
A critical solitary event happened around 6200 BCE with the "implosion" of the Laurentide Ice Sheet.
The cascade of fresh water into the North Atlantic created drought conditions throughout Europe and the eastern Mediterranean while raising ocean levels.
This rise later led to a catastrophe when the Mediterranean found an outlet to the Euxine Lake.
The inflow created the Black Sea, driving people west into the Danube Valley and changing human society in the area drastically.
Continuing fluctuations brought further challenges to increasing populations.
Stable food supplies provided by agriculture reduced mobility and fed population growth.
The cost was people tied to the land and a new vulnerability to climate change.
Fagan's example of this new situation is found in the history of a California people known as the Chumash.
These coastal people had deep ties with family members living inland.
The arrangement kept food supplies relatively stable through exchange networks.
This continuum expanded over a large area resulting in concomitant population growth.
When expansion was no longer feasible, war substituted for exchange systems.
Not a violent people, the conflicts were the result of environmental pressure on food resources.
A drastic social change took place around 1150 AD.
The lost networks were restored through a new arrangement.
The family system was shelved for a new oligarchy of powerful community leaders working cooperatively with meagre, but sustaining food stocks.
While the Chumash remained vulnerable to climate vagaries, they didn't starve as in the past.
Fagan stresses that vulnerability has been built into modern society.
Civilisation is a high-stakes game, and the planet is the banker.
Most of the cards we played in the past are now in the discard pile.
Mobility is not an option when the planet is so thoroughly occupied.
New technologies will not provide new lands submerged by rising seas nor blighted by drought.
If the Gulf Stream fails again, as it has in the past, it will be all Europe faced with the need for a new home.
Where? A Europe covered in ice will produce drought throughout western Asia and likely beyond.
It isn't the cause of climate change that requires examination, but what must be done to deal with, Fagan urges.
The "stewardship" of resources successfully adopted by some societies must be invoked again.
That requires a knowledgeable population, briefed by readers of this book.
This is far from a "should read" book - it is a "must read" for us all.
[stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]
In this highly informative book, author and professor of anthropology, Brian Fagan, looks at the changes in climate that have racked the Earth since the end of the last Ice Age some 15,000 years ago.
During these years, as civilization began, and then spread, periodic and unpredictable climate changes have affected human history, often with catastrophic results.
With chapters covering climactic events from 18,000 years ago to right up to the present, the author spins a fascinating tale of climate and history, as they changed together throughout the millennia.
I really enjoyed this book, and must admit to have found its lesson of unpredictable, but inevitable, climate change to have been quite sobering.
If you want to understand human history, and I mean really understand it, then you must read this book!
In The Long Summer Fagan clearly illustrates the ever-changing nature of climatic variation.
As patterns of glaciation ebb and flow, events such as melting ice can dramatically change the climate of large regions of the earth, often remote from the origin, thrusting the people who live there into new ways of existence as communities are destroyed, often within short time periods.
In former times, people survived by changing their diet or migrating to areas with more favourable climatic conditions, but this is denied to more recent civilisations because of national boundaries and competition for resources in a world of high populations.
Choosing examples from different societies in Europe and Asia, and then the Americas, Fagan progresses through the centuries towards the present day, but omits contemporary society except to say that we ignore human impacts on the global climate at our peril, likening the attitudes of modern political leaders to a ship's captain who denies the existence of bad weather.
Repeatedly through the past centuries, societies have waxed and waned in response to favourable and unfavourable climatic conditions.
At the end of the good periods comes hardship and destruction, themes which have intensified as time progresses and populations grow.
There are sober lessons to be learned from this book, and we had better start learning them.
The reason that a tax seems simple is that no one has proposed the detailed kind of tax that Congress would actually pass.
After all, the Lieberman-Warner climate legislation considered by the Senate in June started as a two-page skeleton outline, which, in our estimation at least, seems simple enough.
"It's a cruel thing to say ... but if we are looking at a slowdown in the economy, there will be less fossil fuels burning, so for the climate it could be an advantage.
"
Atmospheric scientist Paul J Crutzen, winner of the 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on the depletion of the ozone layer.
On September 25, 2008, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative conducted its first sealed bid, uniform price auction and sold 12,565,387 CO2 allowances.
All allowances offered in Auction 1 were sold at a clearing price of $3.07.
The next auction is December 17.
There is growing impetus for a domestic U.S. climate policy that can provide meaningful reductions in emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases.
I describe and analyze an up- stream, economy-wide CO2 cap-and-trade system which implements a gradual trajectory of emissions reductions (with inclusion over time of non-CO2 greenhouse gases), and includes mechanisms to reduce cost uncertainty.
Initially, half of the allowances are allocated through auction and half through free distribution, with the share being auctioned gradually increasing to 100 percent over 25 years.
The system provides for linkage with emission reduction credit projects in other countries, harmonization over time with effective cap-and-trade systems in other countries and regions, and appropriate linkage with actions taken in other countries, in order to establish a level playing field among domestically produced and imported products.
The new numbers, called "scary" by some, were a surprise because scientists thought an economic downturn would slow energy use.
Instead, carbon dioxide output jumped 3 percent from 2006 to 2007.
Meanwhile, forests and oceans, which suck up carbon dioxide, are doing so at lower rates than in the 20th century, scientists said.
If those trends continue, they put the world on track for the highest predicted rises in temperature and sea level.
The pollution leader was China, followed by the United States, which data show is the leader in emissions per person in carbon dioxide output.
And although several developed countries slightly cut their CO2 output in 2007, the United States churned out more.
Still, it was large increases in China, India and other developing countries that spurred the growth of carbon dioxide pollution to a record high of 9.34 billion tons of carbon (8.47 billion metric tons).
Figures released by science agencies in the United States, Great Britain and Australia show that China's added emissions accounted for more than half of the worldwide increase.
China passed the United States as the No.
1 carbon dioxide polluter in 2006.
The PC Energy Report from 2007 estimates that a mid-sized company (roughly the size of ASU) wastes more than $165,000 a year in electricity costs for computers that have been left on overnight.
By turning these computers off, an employer can keep more than 1,381 tons of carbon dioxide (C02) out of the atmosphere.
Across the nation, this adds up to more than $1.72 billion dollars and almost 15 million tons of CO2.
John Whitehead, a professor of economics at Appalachian State University who focuses on environmental economics, concurred that North Carolina is one of the states that would suffer serious damage as sea levels rise.
... the Environmental Economics blog ... is now the default homepage on my browser (but then again, I guess I am a wonk -- a word I learned on the E.E.
blog). That is a very nice service to the profession.
Congress might be a little preoccupied this week with saving the world from the consequences of the overleveraged, unregulated excesses of the financial industry, nevertheless, they may actually make time to find a way to create a package of tax credits that will bolster the renewables industry, keeping its incredible recent momentum going.
Senate to vote next week on energy tax credits is the headline from Reuters and the bill not only extends the tax credit program for renewables, it creates an incentive for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV).
That's a shot in the arm for companies like GM who are banking on PHEVs.
(See my last post below.
)
Permafrost , I wrote about the problem of thawing permafrost here recently.
One group of researchers in Canada, at least, believes that permafrost is more "stubborn" than previously thought and will melt more slowly than predicted.
See this story from AFP.
The qualification in this is that the uppermost layers of permafrost may degrade as quickly as predicted, releasing dangerous amounts of GHG into the atmosphere, but that the deeper levels will stay frozen for much longer periods of time.
You can find the abstract for their work here at "Science.
"
Meanwhile, in Chicago, the City has issued a comprehensive, detailed Climate Action Plan .
See also Chicago Sets Goals for a Cooler City from the Environmental News Service.
One big component here is addressing Chicago's buildings.
They will move to retrofit at least half of their buildings by 2020 hoping to gain a 30% reduction in energy use.
Their energy conservation and their buildings codes will be upgraded to align with the latest international standards.
This is right in line with what Britain has undertaken, as I noted in the post just below.
I've been an admirer of Mayor Daley's environmental leadership for years.
He really does get it.
Phil Clapp , We lost a very strong voice for working to address the climate change crisis this past week when Philip Clapp died.
See this from the "LA Times.
" He founded the National Environmental Trust which merged this year with the Pew Charitable Trusts .
These organizations have been doing groundbreaking work on climate change policy, as well as working on other environmental issues.
Meanwhile, back across the pond, UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown, last week announced a massive private and public investment in energy conservation.
PM makes £1 billion energy pledge is how the 10 Downing Street website describes it.
Much of the program will be a low-tech but incredibly profitable pursuit of " subsidised improvements such as loft and cavity wall insulation.
" There will be money, as well, to help lower-income households with energy payments.
The BBC has this take on the program.
"The government says its aim is to insulate every home in Britain by 2020 - and energy companies, councils and voluntary organisations will be making door-to-door visits in deprived areas to promote the scheme.
" Good on ya, Gordon.
It's the right thing to do.
I am not going to say a lot here about how Governor Palin and the Republicans are treating the climate change issue at this point.
I looked at McCain and Obama back in June.
It is very interesting to note, though, that Palin's entry in the race has generated a huge amount of ink, and climate change is one of the areas on which her views are being made known.
I just wanted to flag some of this coverage to you.
Here, for instance, is an AP article (via Yahoo) out today: Palin's statements on climate change at odds .
Here is Sarah Palin's Record on Climate Change from the wholly nonpolitical sustainability think tank, Worldwatch Institute.
"Politico" reports that Palin, McCain differ on global warming .
A Tom Friedman column recently had some not-entirely flattering things to say on the selection of Palin in the light of climate change and energy concerns, among them "With his choice of Sarah Palin .
John McCain has completed his makeover from the greenest Republican to run for president to just another representative of big oil.
" Ouch.
I am given pause, I will say, by this paragraph from this year's Republican platform.
"Republicans caution against the doomsday climate change scenarios peddled by the aficionados of centralized command-and-control government.
We can ‚ and should ‚ address the risk of climate change based on sound science without succumbing to the no-growth radicalism that treats climate questions as dogma rather than as situations to be managed responsibly.
" No dogma, though, in that.
(See the platform , at page 95 under Environmental Protection for this.
)
Green Jobs , A report out yesterday from the Political Economy Research Institute (PERI) at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and commissioned by the Center for American Progress, says that a $100 billion, two-year national investment in renewable energy, mass transportation, and a "smart grid" for electricity, would yield two million new jobs, with a big chunk going to the manufacturing and construction industries.
Green Recovery - A Program to Create Good Jobs and Start Building a Low-Carbon Economy would, among other things, help in "the reconstruction of local communities and public infrastructure all across America, setting us on a course for a long-term transition to a low-carbon economy that increases our energy independence and helps fight global warming," according to this from the Center for American Progress.
(Caveat: Try to ignore the exceedingly corny graphic of a wind farm backed by a superimposed rainbow background.
) The announcement from PERI on this has a state-by-state breakdown of how the program could generate jobs and income.
"Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore " , One more virtually limitless renewable resource is the ocean.
Its tides and its waves have been pulsing for eons and there is no reason to expect that they should stop anytime soon.
RenewableEnergyWorld.com is, as I believe I've mentioned, a terrific resource.
UK Behind Marine Renewables' Rising Tide is a comprehensive look at the state of play of projects and technologies in Britain.
Beyond that, it shows why the UK is driving much of the activity in this hugely promising field.
Great read.
Scorecard , Reuters has a very useful compendium of where several countries, the EU and some other international compacts all are in regard to their approaches to climate change.
See FACTBOX - Greenhouse Gas Curbs, From Australia to India .
See also their environmental blogs , valuable and compelling reading.
Hurricanes , I've shied away from the hurricane debate.
I'm pretty well at ease with the facts that the oceans are warming and that warmer oceans will produce gnarlier storms.
Beyond that, it goes a little over my head.
However, we've been getting some big storms blowing through the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico, as you know, in the past month or so.
If "Time" has something to say about these matters, though, I can certainly pass along their worthy insights.
Is Global Warming Worsening Hurricanes?
Time delves into that.
I would also very much defer to the excellent Chris Mooney over at The Intersection on this question.
He has, in fact, written a book on this: Storm World: Hurricanes, Politics, and the Battle over Global Warming .
Meanwhile, I will tell you, as a political scientist, that, no matter what you believe about the physics of hurricanes, Katrina vastly increased the salience of climate change as a serious issue for Americans.
Carbon Capture and Storage , I have posited my skepticism about the feasibility of CCS a number of times here.
(See CCS - The Viability of Carbon Capture and Storage and CCS Continued .
) Now Vattenfall, an exceedingly reputable European energy giant, has launched an ambitious pilot.
Their press release says "The carbon dioxide produced in this pilot plant will not be released into the atmosphere, instead it will be almost completely separated, liquefied and further treated for long-term secure underground storage.
" Good on ya, mate.
See also the Vattenfall press kit on CCS for more information.
I wrote recently here about the (really) enormous carbon sequestration potential of the terra preta approach to soil enrichment for agriculture.
Well, you wouldn't be surprised to know that the earth already has sequestered many billions of tons of carbon dioxide and methane over time.
The bad news is that as the world warms, the permafrost that has kept so much of these GHGs in its icy grip is also warming.
Permafrost is defined as ground that has been frozen for more than two years.
Much of the earth's permafrost has been frozen for thousands of years.
We have known about the disastrous potential of the release of ice-trapped GHGs for several years.
Recent research, however, indicates that the amount of carbon stored in the Northern Hemisphere is even greater than previously thought.
"The estimated 1,672 billion metric tons of carbon locked up in the permafrost is more than double the 780 billion tons in the atmosphere today.
"It's bigger than we thought,'" says the lead researcher.
See this from "ScienceDaily.
" If much of this permafrost melts, then the implications for accelerating global warming are momentous.
See also the abstract for this paper.
How bad is the potential impact.
An article from the "Discovery Channel" is titled Arctic Tundra Holds Global Warming Time Bomb .
As you can see, there's a very bad feedback loop involved here.
As the air warms further, more permafrost is thawed and more GHG is released, which further warms the atmosphere, etc., etc.
As I have pointed out before, you don't have to be sitting on top of Yellowstone National Park or the volcanoes in Iceland to use geothermal.
There's a landmark geothermal project in downtown Manhattan for instance.
I've mentioned geothermal here a number of times, including in this post from March that references the landmark M.I.T.
study that puts geothermal in the forefront.
The (really) bad news is that although fertilizers have increased agricultural output over the years, they have also caused devastating environmental impacts.
I have been remiss here in not addressing the harm that the increasingly pervasive use of fertilizers has had, not only on exacerbating global warming, but on creating "dead zones" in key marine areas.
Here is an important article today from the "NY Times" - Beyond Carbon: Scientists Worry About Nitrogen's Effects .
It points out that public perception of the climate change crisis is mainly focused on the impacts from carbon dioxide and not on other greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide, both listed under the Kyoto Protocol as regulated GHGs.
I would guess that the general public's lack of understanding of the impacts of these other GHGs is true.
However, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and scientists and policy analysts all over the world, fully recognize the dangers.
The IPCC notes "Agriculture accounted for an estimated emission of 5.1 to 6.1 Gt carbon dioxide-eq/yr in 2005 (10-12% of total global anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases).
Methane contributes 3.3 Gt carbon dioxide-eq/yr and nitrous oxide 2.8 Gt carbon dioxide-eq/yr.
Of global anthropogenic emissions in 2005, agriculture accounts for about 60% of nitrous oxide and about 50% of methane.
" (See the chapter on Agriculture from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report, Working Group III.
)
Notice that the IPCC, as others do, uses the measure "carbon dioxide-equivalent.
" The IPCC says carbon dioxide " is the reference gas against which other greenhouse gases are measured" So, in any event, methane and nitrous oxide are very much under scrutiny along with carbon dioxide, and three others, sulphur hexafluoride, hydrofluorocarbons, and perfluorocarbons, used in refrigeration and for other heavy industrial purposes.
These last three are being phased out under Kyoto and the Montreal Protocol because they are potent ozone-depleting chemicals (ODCs) as well.
Let's return to nitrogen fertilizers and nitrous oxide, with an output of nearly three billion tons a year of carbon dioxide equivalent.
Greenpeace International had an excellent report out earlier this year - Cool Farming: Climate impacts of agriculture and mitigation potential .
As they put it: "Nitrous oxide emissions are mainly associated with nitrogen fertilisers and manure applied to soils.
Fertilisers are often applied in excess and not fully used by the crop plants, so that some of the surplus is lost as nitrous oxide to the atmosphere.
" This is a good, comprehensive report with some lucid explanations and some worthwhile graphics.
They also have a good bit to say here about mitigation options, as does the IPCC, of course, in the document cited above.
See also the International Nitrogen Initiative which is " dedicated to optimizing the use of nitrogen in food production, while minimizing the negative effects of nitrogen on human health and the environment as a result of food and energy production.
"
The "NY Times" article is careful to note that there are other concerns in play aside from the radiative forcing from nitrous oxide, not to mention the carbon dioxide and methane from agriculture.
One of the most dire of these are the ocean dead zones that result from the pooling of millions of tons of nitrogen fertilizer runoff.
NASA explains it this way: "The apparent cause of the creeping dead zones is agriculture, specifically fertilizer.
While fertilizer is necessary to foster bumper agricultural crops, it also runs off the fields into the streams and rivers of a watershed.
When the fertilizer reaches the ocean, it just becomes more nutrients for the phytoplankton, so they do what they do best: they grow and multiply.
Which leads to more organic matter reaching the bottom, more bacterial respiration, and more anoxic bottom water.
" For some good graphic explanations of the phenomenon, try this from the Science Museum of Minnesota.
AMNH has a brand-new exhibit on climate change.
I went to the press opening last week, toured the exhibit then and have been back once since, and have surfed the website a bit.
In museum parlance, this is a blockbuster show.
The museum's president, Ellen Futter, described the exhibit as an attempt to demystify the subject.
It also offers, in her words, a "mosaic of solutions" to global warming.
Michael Novacek, Provost of Science, said the science on climate change has become much more clear and compelling.
In the exhibit hall, I spoke with Edmond Mathez, co-curator of the exhibit.
I asked him if there wasn't rather more information than could be digested in the exhibit.
He said there was indeed a lot of information on display, but that he expected people to come more than once.
He told me you couldn't properly just put up the "headlines" but that the exhibit has layers of information into which people can delve.
It has both a textual and graphic density that will appeal to the student of environmental and energy issues.
I also talked to Michael Oppenheimer , an old acquaintance from when I was doing activist work with the Sierra Club on acid rain and he was Senior Scientist with the Environmental Defense Fund .
Michael is at Princeton and is involved in several programs there.
He was also one of the lead authors of last year's critical series of reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
He has been, throughout his career, both a top-level scientist and an activist.
He long ago realized the importance of having environmental science understood by the public and policy makers and having the serious message of environmental protection embraced by them.
He is co-curating the exhibit.
You can listen to an informative interview with Michael here talking about the exhibit from NPR, and you can see him here in a 15-minute interview with Charlie Rose talking about the IPCC report.
Species Loss - The bad news is that the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has issued its “Red List” for 2008 and there are many species endangered and threatened.
That there are environmental threats to thousands of species is not news, certainly, but global warming is exacerbating the problem.
This in itself is also not news, unfortunately, but the IUCN is documenting the dangers.
In this article from ENN, we note: “Thirty-five percent of the world’s birds, 52 percent of amphibians and 71 percent of warm-water reef-building corals are likely to be particularly susceptible to climate change”
See also this article from “Time” - How Climate Change Will Impact Animals .
This article quotes the president of Conservation International , Russell Mittermeier: “Global warming is something that all conservationists are worried about.” You can also get audio of an interview with Mittermeier.
Bali Action Plan - For the wonks amongst us, you can find a new report from UNDP, “The Bali Action Plan: Key Issues In The Climate Negotiations - Summary For Policy Makers” here .
Bad News on Emissions , Here's a depressing but not overly surprising story from the AP: Global warming pollution increases 3 percent .
One positive outcome of the world recession into which we're heading , or into which we've already headed , may be the slowing down of our GHG emissions.
It's certainly not how we want this to happen.
Let's just hope that we can keep moving forward, if more slowly economically, and continue to transition to a low or zero-carbon world.
Coal Plants Diminished Role?
, Here's an eyecatcher from "USA Today" that also has national implications: Utilities shrink the role of coal on global-warming worries .
I wrote about some of the hits that old King Coal's been taking at Coal Takes Some Lumps back in February.
These are new, very interesting developments being reported.
The Physical Science Basis , Here's an excellent update on the science of global warming from the venerable "Scientific American.
" If you've not been following every development , who can?
, this is a great place to dig in.
See also the IPCC's definitive Working Group I report from 2007.
I went to an interesting confabulation yesterday up at the Earth Institute.
Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Earth Institute , and Yvo de Boer, Executive Secretary of the UNFCC , kicked around the relative merits of the financial architecture of the Kyoto Protocol.
In a nutshell, Sachs thought the way we've been doing business in terms of creating a carbon market based on the regulatory regime of the Kyoto Protocol is insufficient to meet the Herculean task of confronting global warming.
He said that a carbon tax would be much more effective.
Mr. de Boer maintained that building out the regulatory scheme in an agreement that will, hopefully, be finalized in Copenhagen next year, will enable further gains than those we've already realized from the Kyoto financial mechanisms.
The discussion got worldwide press.
See this , for instance, from Reuters.
(I've highlighted some aspects of this debate before, here for one example.
)
One of the points that de Boer made regarding the usefulness of the cap-and-trade system is that it generates interest.
It certainly has caught the interest of the financial industry.
A market-based approach was also endorsed in Bali, de Boer reminded the audience.
He also made it clear that the market mechanisms are not the only ones.
He did see a role for taxes, subsidies etc.
For a distillation of the UNFCCC's views on this, see Carbon market, international offset mechanisms critical in meeting climate change challenge from their latest newsletter.
Sachs articulated a number of faults with the present system.
The existence of two types of participants in the Kyoto Protocol , those subject to regulation and those developing countries who are not , is a big flaw.
In a word, the US won't sign the Copenhagen agreement if China and India, not to mention South Africa and Brazil, among others, aren't required to make firm GHG-reduction commitments.
The 1997 Byrd-Hagel resolution in the US Senate is all the proof anyone needs of that.
Another problem is the amount of money available from an international regime.
It won't be enough, Sachs said.
He also cited the incredible complexity of the regulatory scheme in this.
It would be much simpler to tax the "upstream" sources of the GHGs: the coal mines and pits or the oil and gas wells.
Energy and Commerce - The US House of Representatives’ Energy and Commerce Committee has issued a discussion draft to its members and the public on climate change legislation.
See this from Bloomberg News and this from Gristmill.
As I noted here in July, this powerful committee seems the likely bet as the principal venue in which cap-and-trade legislation is going to be substantially shaped.
The Senate and the new President will, of course, have their say.
The next President, as you know, be he either of the two candidates, will be considerably more favorable to a substantive climate change package than the present occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. The new President will also very possibly go to the table in Copenhagen in December of 2009 armed with a new US law.
This will be a critical element in getting nations emitting even more dangerous amounts of GHG than the US and Europe, namely China and India, to come under an international regulatory umbrella.
Rich Boucher, chairman of the subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality, and John Dingell, chairman of the full committee, have issued a memo to their members describing the discussion draft.
(For all the relevant Energy and Commerce documents, including the excellent series of white papers they’ve issued, you can go here .
)
The memo further notes that some of the groundwork for this initiative has already been done with the passage of the energy bill in December of 2007.
I would note that the energy provisions of the recent “Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008″ also move us further down the road to a comprehensive federal climate change policy.
I’ve noted my skepticism about CCS a number of times, the last time here .
I am entirely willing, however, to be proven wrong.
Certainly, the most promising approach in this regard is the gasification of coal and then using the gas for combustion.
Gas can be much more easily “cleaned” of the carbon dioxide and other pollutants.
Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) could prove the way forward.
See this from GE, for example, this from Siemens or this from DOE.
RGGI - Ten Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states have decided not to wait for a federal law.
The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative has a more modest framework, certainly, than the federal scheme that is coming or the ETS.
Nevertheless, it will require a cap on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants.
See this from the NY State Department of Environmental Conservation (my old employer) for a look at how the program will be managed.
The RGGI has just had its first auction of allowances and realized $38,575,783 for the six states participating this time around.
The press release quotes NYSDEC Commissioner Pete Grannis: “The first RGGI auction has successfully used market forces to set a price on carbon, and this will send a clear market signal to support the investment in clean energy technologies.” There was a better-than-expected demand for the allowances according to this article from the “FT.” For more on the RGGI, go to their website and this recent “NY Times” article .
Not to be outdone, the Western Climate Initiative , a compact of seven Western states and four Canadian provinces, is well along in creating its own robust regulatory regime.
We’re heading into a tempest now.
The world economic crisis that threatens to swamp hundreds of millions of people is going to slow down progress on confronting climate change.
The eloquent and insightful “Charlemagne,” writing in “The Economist,” notes the difficulties that Europe has had in meeting its ambitious renewable energy and GHG reduction goals.
In my fourth post, from over a year and half ago, I wrote about the EU Summit Agreement .
I wrote that “The European Union Summit meeting produced a truly historic agreement on greenhouse gas reduction, renewable energy, and energy efficiency, among other things.” Well, the times were good and the Europeans were energized.
There was a Homeric flavor to the Summit’s pronouncements, particularly in the light of the daunting specter of global warming.
In A changed climate , Charlemagne notes “The heroic mood is gone now.
In March 2007 Angela Merkel, the German chancellor and chairman of the summit, was a green champion.
Today she sounds like a lobbyist for German business, listing the industries that must be shielded from the full costs of her package.
In truth, almost every country has found reasons why the climate-change promises may be impossible to meet in their current form.
Britain is gloomy about its renewable-energy targets.”
There will be critical votes tomorrow in the EU’s Environment Committee.
They will show the depth of the commitment in Europe to realizing the EU’s goals .
See Brussels readies for “Super Tuesday’ climate vote from the “EurActiv” news service.
“But the vote comes amidst a worsening economic crisis, with several member states indicating that they want to put the brakes on any rapid adoption of the measures.”
Update , Apparently my thinking is entirely in tune with that of Lord Stern of Brentford, world-class economist and lead author of the Stern Review on the economics of climate change .
See Now is the time to tackle global warming from ”The Guardian” today in which he says “We’re going to have to grow out of this … and this is an area which looks as though it could well grow strongly and with the right support could be one of the major engines of growth.” Lord Stern is the chair of the just-opened Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics.
As you might imagine, the renewables folks are over the moon.
See this release from the Solar Energy Industries Association.
“By passing this bill, Congress has finally given the solar energy industry “policy certainty’ that will attract investment, expand manufacturing and lower the cost of solar energy to consumers,” said Roger Efird, SEIA chairman.
The American Wind Energy Association said here “These tax credits are essential to the continued growth of wind energy, to the economic and energy security of the United States, and to a successful beginning in the fight against global warming.”
In any event, after these Know-Nothings, Democratic and Republican, heard from their constituents who had lost thousands on Monday, and perhaps were sobered at the very real prospect of a depression staring us in the face, they came to the table.
What's this got to do with climate change?
I've flogged the question of tax credits for renewables to you here time and again, and I had last written that these appeared to be headed into oblivion in this Congress.
Well, not so fast: The Senate is going to include these in the package it's going to vote on today.
See this from Reuters and this from the "LA Times"
I've mentioned the question of the renewable energy tax credits any number of times at this blog, most recently on September 21 and 24 below.
Well, the House, not surprisingly, did not embrace the Senate's bill from September 23.
For one thing, the Senate bill, somewhat out of left field and only to placate Republican Senators and the White House, gives new tax breaks for refineries to develop oil from shale and tar sands or for coal liquefaction.
These aims are entirely counterproductive to either helping the renewable energy industry in this country or to reducing greenhouse gases.
The Senate bill also was an omnibus package that included, among other things, a one-year reprieve for 20 million people from the alternative minimum tax (not in itself a bad thing, certainly).
The House, as some predicted, created a stand-alone bill for the renewables and some other related infrastructure initiatives (as well as personal and business tax relief items) - the Renewable Energy and Job Creation Tax Act of 2008 (H.R.
7060). It passed on September 26 by a vote of 257 , 166.
This is, not incidentally, a terrific piece of legislation overall with provisions supporting not only renewables but also energy efficiency projects, green building, and the smart grid, not to mention credits for research.
See this story, US renewables tax break imbroglio rumbles on , from the British news service "BusinessGreen" and this, House OKs extending renewable energy tax credits , from Reuters.
(For a little deeper look and some inside baseball, see this from "Congressional Quarterly.
")
With the Senate and House bills differing so, and it being past time for Congress to break for the elections , and with the little matter of the $700 billion financial industry bailout somewhat reducing Congress's ability to focus on extraneous matters , it doesn't look as if the tax credits are going to fly until, at least, the lame duck session between the elections and the inauguration of the new Congress and President.
Given how difficult this has all been, it might not come into being even then.
It is distinctly possible that the next Congress will be taking this up.
What will the disruption in the tax credits mean for the renewables industry?
It won't be good, but it won't be fatal by any stretch of the imagination.
As noted in my last post below, we are already in a renewables revolution.
The only question is how fast will it come , and will it be fast enough to avert catastrophic climate change.
Spanish President Jose Zapatero gave an address in which he noted a number of critical issues in which Spain is actively engaged.
One of these is climate change.
He noted his country's leading position on renewable energy.
He said that countries which take the lead in developing and deploying new renewable technologies will enjoy huge advantages.
(This echoes what I heard recently from a leading writer, editor and consultant on energy who I was interviewing for an article on the "smart grid" movement.
) Spain has one of the top wind energy industries in the world.
This good little article from "Treehugger" characterizes Spain as an RE "powerhouse.
" One of the biggest manufacturers worldwide is Gamesa .
Not incidentally, I wrote here recently about Spain's push for electric cars.
President Zapatero's claims are entirely well founded.
The first to speak was Benita Ferrero-Waldner, EU Commissioner for External Relations and Neighborhood Policy.
She cited the IPCC and other research identifying climate change as an extraordinary threat.
She noted that a number of analyses have identified it as a "threat multiplier," so it is a significant security concern as well.
She quoted Robert Schuman, one of the visionaries who fostered the creation of the organizations which grew into the European Union: "World peace cannot be safeguarded without the making of creative efforts proportionate to the dangers which threaten it.
" (See the entirety of the landmark "Schuman Declaration" here .
) Ferrero-Waldner was clearly equating the overall threat of catastrophic climate change with world war.
Unfortunately, for my money, she dwelled a little overmuch on the question of pipelines carrying oil and natural gas coming into Europe and not enough on the potential for regional and international cooperation on renewables.
(See my references here and here about the extraordinary potential in the Desertec initiative and the "SuperSmart" grid.
)
Ashok Gupta is an old hand, having led NRDC's efforts on energy for years.
He defined energy security as encompassing not only the availability of the energy supply but also how energy use impacts global climate change and local and regional environmental concerns.
He also emphasized the critical importance of energy efficiency.
Phil Sharp is a former Congressman who runs Resources for the Future , an influential policy shop in Washington.
He said that oil prices are going to remain high for the foreseeable future, driven by demand, and by the fact that we are in the age of Peak Oil .
He thinks energy is going to remain very high on our to-do list because of these factors and because of the threat of climate change.
He sees the need to "decarbonize" our societies.
Last, but not least by a long shot, was Vijay V. Vaitheeswaran, correspondent for " The Economist .
" Vaitheeswaran is quite articulate and had a number of salient points to make, among them that there are three pillars of energy instability: poverty, the environment, and geopolitics.
On the first of these, he cited the fact that much of the developing world is off the grid and relies on wood, coal, dung and other cheap fuels for energy for heat and cooking.
This has a devastating health impact because of the enormous amounts of soot generated.
(See my post, Black Carbon and Solar Cookers .
) On environmental concerns, he noted the problems of climate change and local pollution.
On the matter of geopolitics, he said that because there is so much oil concentrated in so few countries, that this is considerable cause for concern.
On the positive side, Vaitheeswaran and I share the perspective that there are extraordinary developments that are shaping things such that we will see the movement toward clean, reliable distributed energy continue to burgeon.
He identified three "megatrends" that are fostering an energy revolution: First, he sees "smarter" government involvement.
Governments are market minded, but they are increasingly thoughtful about energy and environmental policy.
Secondly, he says there's a bottom-up revolution being driven by NGOs (like NRDC, Environmental Defense Fund, and many others) in which there is a growing confluence in areas like climate policy and business.
(See, for instance, my review of EDF's Earth: The Sequel and the work of the US Climate Action Partnership .
) Finally, Vaitheeswaran sees a golden age of innovation coming into being.
I've referenced his book, ZOOM: The Global Race to Fuel the Car of the Future , a number of times here.
The (Annotated) Climate Declaration From the Industrial Powers
[UPDATE, 7/9: Please see the new post on the joint statement of developing and developed countries on climate action .
] When the first climate treaty was negotiated in 1992, the world’s nations, recognizing that the buildup of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases emitted mainly by burning fossil fuels and forests represented an unacceptable risk, pledged to avoid “dangerous” human interference with the climate.
But they studiously avoided specifying how much of these gases was too much.
Today the countries most responsible for the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations so far, the established industrialized powers, inched toward doing so.
Below we’ll take a deeper look at their new pledge.
You’re invited to help annotate it in the same way we’ve explored recent climate speeches and the Bush administration’s decision on protecting polar bears .
Their “declaration on environment and climate” is largely intended to feed into ongoing international negotiations toward a new climate treaty that the world’s nations have pledged to shape by the end of next year.
The next step in Japan before everyone leaves for home — one arranged by the Bush administration — is a meeting tomorrow of the Group of 8 along with representatives from the European Union and the world’s emerging economic (and climatic) powers, led by China and India, to get them on board the “50 by 2050″ greenhouse train as well.
This is seen as a vital step because these countries will soon be the dominant emitters of carbon dioxide and the other heat-trapping gases.
In fact, experts have calculated that the world’s rich countries could shut down carbon dioxide emissions entirely and the atmospheric concentration would still reach 450 parts per million — a level deemed unacceptably dangerous by many scientists — by 2070.
(If no one does anything, that threshold is reached in 2040.
) The major developing countries, known in the negotiations as “Plus 5,” issued their own joint climate statement (which I’ll explore in another post anon).
Below is the Declaration on Environment and Climate Change from the Group of 8.
I’ll be annotating it as time allows and encourage you to weigh in in a comment.
I’ll add footnote-style links to your contribution if you allude or refer to specific passages you think are significant, disingenuous, wishful, toothless, powerful…:
22.
We reconfirm the significance of the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as providing the most comprehensive assessment of the science and encourage the continuation of the science-based approach that should guide our climate protection efforts.
We reaffirm our commitment to take strong leadership in combating climate change and in this respect, welcome decisions taken in Bali as the foundation for reaching a global agreement in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process by 2009.
We are committed to its successful conclusion.
Enhanced commitments or actions by all major economies are essential for tackling climate change.
Therefore, we endorse the positive contribution of the Major Economies Leaders Meeting to the UNFCCC.
[
23.
We are committed to avoiding the most serious consequences of climate change and determined to achieve the stabilization of atmospheric concentrations of global greenhouse gases consistent with the ultimate objective of Article 2 of the Convention and within a time frame that should be compatible with economic growth and energy security.
[
Andy Revkin - The Article 2 mentioned above is the statement on avoiding "dangerous" human interference with climate in the original climate treaty, which was completed at the Earth Summit in Brazil in 1992.
The goal of a 50-percent cut by 2050 leaves out the baseline, meaning it's presumably a reduction from today's emission levels.
Environmentalists and some European leaders wanted the baseline year to be 1990, as was the case with the original 1992 treaty.
The line about avoiding danger without impeding economic growth basically says we can only do this if we find a way to make other energy options as cheap as the world's mainstays now -- coal and oil.
Here, the Group of 8 recognizes that technological innovation will be essential.
Let's see further down what they plan to do to stimulate it.
]
24.
Making progress towards the shared vision, and a long-term global goal will require mid-term goals and national plans to achieve them.
These plans may reflect a diversity of mitigation and adaptation approaches.
Sectoral approaches are useful tools among others for achieving national emission reduction objectives.
We look forward to discussing this issue with leaders of other major economies tomorrow and to continuing the discussions among the major economies and in the UNFCCC negotiations over the coming months.
We recognize that what the major developed economies do will differ from what major developing economies do, consistent with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.
In this respect, we acknowledge our leadership role and each of us will implement ambitious economy-wide mid-term goals in order to achieve absolute emissions reductions and, where applicable, first stop the growth of emissions as soon as possible, reflecting comparable efforts among all developed economies, taking into account differences in their national circumstances.
We will also help support the mitigation plans of major developing economies by technology, financing and capacity-building.
At the same time, in order to ensure an effective and ambitious global post-2012 climate regime, all major economies will need to commit to meaningful mitigation actions to be bound in the international agreement to be negotiated by the end of 2009.
Andy Revkin - This line aims to fill a glaring gap in the 1992 Framework Convention on Climate Change and the subsequent Kyoto Protocol, both of which don't consider carbon dioxide emissions from international aviation and shipping.
There's a big push by some entrepreneurs now to expand the use of climate-friendly biofuels in jets (not all biofuels are created equal!).
]
Andy Revkin - Environmental campaigners and many climate scientists feel that the time for words like "aspirational" passed long ago and have been pressing for concrete commitments.
But the intertwined constraints of diplomacy and international economic competition seem to make firm steps nearly impossible in this arena.
To get a sense of how little has changed, you might click here to read a 1992 story by me on the state of affairs as the first climate treaty was negotiated .
]
27.
We promote clean energy, given its importance in tackling climate change and for the enhancement of energy security, by setting national goals and formulating action plans followed by appropriate monitoring.
We believe that there are significant and growing economic and employment opportunities in this sector.
We recognize the important role of renewable energy in tackling climate change and in the long term reducing our dependency on fossil fuels.
28.
We witness that a growing number of countries have expressed their interests in nuclear power programs as a means to addressing climate change and energy security concerns.
These countries regard nuclear power as an essential instrument in reducing dependence on fossil fuels and hence greenhouse gas emissions.
We reiterate that safeguards (nuclear nonproliferation), nuclear safety and nuclear security (3S) are fundamental principles for the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Against this background, an international initiative proposed by Japan on 3S-based nuclear energy infrastructure will be launched.
We affirm the role of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in this process.
29.
Recognizing the linkage between the potential impacts of climate change and development, mitigation and adaptation strategies should be pursued as part of development and poverty eradication efforts.
A successful global response to climate change requires a partnership between developing and developed countries.
Developing countries’ efforts to put in place appropriate national mitigation and adaptation plans to build low carbon, climate resilient economies, should be supported by scaled up assistance from developed countries.
Andy Revkin - This is acknowledgment of the reality that, in terms of climate at least, the world is very much not flat .
]
30.
Recognizing that poorer countries are among the most vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change, we will continue and enhance cooperation with developing countries, in particular least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing states, in their efforts to adapt to climate change including disaster risk reduction.
To address this issue, we commit to support urgent actions to mainstream adaptation into broader development strategies and encourage developing countries themselves to integrate adaptation into their development policies.
The early start of activities under the UNFCCC Adaptation Fund should make an important contribution in this respect.
We call on the multilateral development banks and other development agencies to support countries in this endeavor.
We note the opportunity to promote research on complementary technological approaches which may contribute towards maintaining a stable climate.
To respond to the growing demand for Earth observation data, we will accelerate efforts within the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS), which builds on the work of UN specialized agencies and programs, in priority areas, inter alia, climate change and water resources management, by strengthening observation, prediction and data sharing.
We also support capacity building for developing countries in earth observations and promote interoperability and linkage with other partners.
32.
Substantial finance and investments will be needed to meet the urgent challenges of mitigation, adaptation and access to clean energy in developing countries.
While the main sources of finance will be the private sector, public resources are essential to help the poorest and to leverage private resources, notably by financing incremental costs and can be very effective in inducing emissions reduction when national policies provide incentives for low carbon investment.
In this regard, we welcome and support the establishment of the Climate Investment Funds (CIF) including the Clean Technology Fund (CTF) and the Strategic Climate Fund (SCF), administered by the World Bank.
G8 members have thus far pledged approximately US$ 6 billion as an ODA contribution to the funds and welcome commitments from other donors.
The CIF will scale up public and private finance.
They will have broad-based and inclusive governance mechanisms and, as an interim measure, fill an immediate financial gap for urgent actions until a new financial architecture under the post-2012 regime is effective.
The CTF will aim to promote low-carbon economies by helping to finance deployment in developing countries of commercially available cleaner energy technologies through investments in support of credible national mitigation plans that include low-carbon objectives.
The SCF will help more vulnerable countries develop climate-resilient economies and take actions to prevent deforestation, and could provide helpful lessons in the context of discussions on post-2012 financing arrangements.
These funds will complement existing multilateral efforts, including the Global Environmental Facility (GEF), which plays the key role as the main financial instrument of the UNFCCC and which we are committed to reinforcing.
We also welcome various bilateral financial initiatives taken by G8 members, including public/private partnerships capable of generating additional investment.
We expect such financial assistance to be delivered in a coordinated manner and encourage active engagement by developing countries in an effective post-2012 framework.
[
33.
Market mechanisms, such as emissions-trading within and between countries, tax incentives, performance-based regulation, fees or taxes and consumer labeling can provide pricing signals and have the potential to deliver economic incentives to the private sector.
We also recognize that they help to achieve emission reductions in a cost effective manner and to stimulate long-term innovation.
We intend to promote such instruments in accordance with our national circumstances and share experience on the effectiveness of the different instruments.
In this regard, we welcome the Action Plan for Climate Change to Enhance the Engagement of Private and Public Financial Institutions adopted by our Finance Ministers.
34.
Efforts in the WTO negotiations to eliminate tariffs and non-tariff barriers to environmental goods and services should be enhanced with a view to disseminating clean technology and skills.
Additionally, consideration should be given to the reduction or elimination of trade barriers on a voluntary basis on goods and services directly linked to addressing climate change.
[
1 ] We also agree to encourage initiatives contributing to climate change mitigation including purchasing and investment policies and practices that promote and support the cleaner and more efficient products and services that can contribute to lower carbon emissions.
35.
We welcome the final report of the Gleneagles Dialogue on Climate Change, Clean Energy and Sustainable Development.
We also welcome the reports submitted by the IEA and the World Bank on their work related to the Gleneagles Plan of Action and continue to cooperate with those organizations.
We value the useful exchange of views both between member countries and also business and civil society participants and acknowledge the role that further exchanges of this nature can play in supporting action on climate change and the UNFCCC process.
We note the significant progress made by the multilateral development banks on the Clean Energy Investment Framework (CEIF) agreed at Gleneagles and welcome their joint level of ambition to mobilize public and private investments of over US$100 billion up to 2010 from within existing resources.
We call upon these Banks to build on the CEIF to develop comprehensive strategies to guide the integration of climate change into their development work and to set specific targets for low carbon investments like renewable energy.
36.
We encourage actions for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (REDD) including the development of an international forest monitoring network building on existing initiatives.
Recognizing the urgent need to curb illegal logging and its associated trade, we welcome the G8 Forest Experts’ Report on Illegal Logging.
We will follow up, as appropriate, its preliminary list of options.
We will make all possible efforts by ensuring close coordination among various fora and initiatives with a view to promoting effective forest law enforcement and governance and sustainable forest management worldwide.
We will also consider ways to enhance our cooperation to combat forest fires.
37.
Recognizing the crucial importance of the conservation and the sustainable use of biodiversity as highlighted at the 9th meeting of the Conference of the Parties of the Convention on Biological Diversity held in Bonn, we share the concerns regarding the vulnerability of biodiversity.
We endorse the Kobe Call for Action for Biodiversity and reiterate our commitment to increase our efforts to reduce the rate of biodiversity loss significantly in order to achieve the globally agreed 2010 Biodiversity Target, including by reducing threats from the illicit trade in wildlife.
We will promote a co-benefits approach that will lead to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity as well.
We note the importance of improving the interface between research activities and the public and policy makers.
38.
In implementing the principles of the 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle), we recognize the importance of how we use resources throughout their life cycles to a thriving global economy and environment.
To this end, we endorse the Kobe 3R Action Plan.
We will set targets as appropriate taking into account resource productivity, based on the work of the OECD in furthering efforts to optimize resource cycles.
We recognize the importance of information sharing, stakeholder partnerships, and the inclusion of 3R viewpoint in project development and investment.
We recognize the significance of reducing barriers to trade in remanufactured goods and for the G8 members to the WTO to support the recently submitted proposal to liberalize trade in remanufactured goods under the WTO Doha Round.
We support the international circulation of reusable and recyclable materials and resources in an environmentally sound manner consistent with the Basel Convention.
In view of the present discussion of the role of carbon dioxide in effecting global temperature I would like to know of any laboratory or bench experiments that show a temperature- CO2 concentration curve within the range of currently measured atmospheric CO2 levels.
India and China will be the first to recognize that CO2 is a boon to the poor in a cooling world.
Probably, I should say they ‘have been’ the first to recognize that fact, because it seems clear that the realization has come to them.
Now, as the old carbon paradigm collapses, the issue will be progressively framed as evil political manipulators from the elite of the first world attempting to grind the poor of the world even more than they already are, by taking cheap energy off the table for them by erroneous demonization of carbon dioxide.
With whom do you stand?
Among other things, the refusal to come face to face with these “facts of life” could mean that the human species runs the unacceptable risk of inadvertently precipitating a colossal, human-driven, ecological cataclysm of some sort in the years ahead.
Sustainable alternative energy should find something besides the globe’s natural climate regulatory mechanisms, the sun, the winds, and the water, or else run into unacceptable unintended side effects as the scale of the sustainable efforts reach the magnitude necessary to replace fossil fuels.
The other thing that caught my eye is the rhetorical change when talking about nuclear power.
Here the phrase is “We witness that a growing number of countries have expressed their interests in nuclear power programs as a means to addressing climate change and energy security concerns” – notice the passive ‘witness’, which is in stark contrast to the active tone of the rest of the declaration.
Article 32 is a slap in the face of developing countries.
At the recent Bonn climate negotiations they have made extensively clear, that they won’t accept that climate funding will be managed outside the UN Climate Convention.
See http://www.twnside.org.sg/title2/climate/news/TWNbonnupdate5.doc for more information .
But the G8 endorsed the World Bank as the locus of climate financing.
This amounts to creating another major stumbling block towards a comprehensive climate agreement in Copenhagen.
“While the statement may appear as a movement forward, we are concerned that it may, in effect, be a regression from what is required to make a meaningful contribution to meeting the challenges of climate change,” van Schalkwyk said in a statement.
“It is regrettable that the lowest common denominator in the G8 determined the level of ambition in the G8 declaration on climate change.”
Response by Marthinus van Schalkwyk, South African Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism, to the G8 Declaration on Climate Change, 8 July 2008:
South Africa has noted the G8 Statement on Climate Change.
While the Statement may appear as a movement forward, we are concerned that it may, in effect, be a regression from what is required to make a meaningful contribution to meeting the challenges of climate change.
We came to Hokkaido with the expectation that the eight major industrialised economies of the world would demonstrate leadership on the climate change issue.
The long term global goal for emission reductions of 50% by 2050 falls below what is scientifically required to stabilise the atmosphere at a relatively safe level.
To be meaningful and credible, a long term goal must have a base year, it must be underpinned by ambitious mid-term targets and actions and it should be based on an equitable burden-sharing paradigm.
We know very well that there are many countries in the G8 grouping that share our ambitious expectations, and therefore it is regrettable that the lowest common denominator in the G8 determined the level of ambition in the G8 Declaration on climate change.
The Clean Technology Fund (CTF) and the Strategic Climate Fund (SCF) both sound like very good ideas, and the initial funding levels aren’t bad at all – though I believe roughly a factor of 10 higher in some form will be necessary to make the significant progress we really need.
An increase from 300 to 358 ppm is an increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration of exactly 0.000058.
#22: I ask myself, if every nation exhibited unprecedented leadership and exceeded the most aggressive commitments of this declaration, in what year (century?
) would atmospheric CO2 concentrations stop rising?
Fall below 350ppm?
#22: I ask myself, if global CO2 emissions and atmospheric CO2 levels have exceeded the worst case scenario predicted by the IPCC#4, for 2008, were is there any integrity in the statement, ” We reconfirm the significance of the IPCC#4″?
With most of the other G8 countries already committed to significant cuts, the United States is once again proving to be the lowest common denominator in global agreements to cut heat-trapping emissions.
The ‘goal’ announced today doesn’t even reach the global warming goal line.
And while greater cuts are needed here in America to avert a climate catastrophe, even this new goal means that as soon as Air Force One touches down at Andrews Air Force Base, President Bush should get working on an aggressive plan to cut United States emissions.
Unfortunately, I have little confidence that he will do so.
This administration appears more interested in passing the buck than in passing climate change legislation that would make the necessary cuts in global warming emissions.
The bottom line is that 50 percent cuts by 2050 is the minimum effort to avert a climate catastrophe, and America must make the maximum effort possible as the number one per capita and historical emitter of heat-trapping pollution.
To this end, I have introduced the Investing in Climate Action and Protection Act, or iCAP.
It would cut emissions by 85 percent of current levels by 2050.
By 2050 or so, the world population is expected to reach nine billion, essentially adding two Chinas to the number of people alive today.
Those billions will be seeking food, water and other resources on a planet where, scientists say, humans are already shaping climate and the web of life.

Al Gore giving a speech on energy and climate policy in Washington on Thursday.
(Credit: Brendan Smialowski for The New York Times)
[UPDATE, 7/19 5:30 p.m.: Al Gore carried his campaign for an energy transformation in the United States to the blogosphere on Saturday with an appearance at the Netroots Nation conference of "progressive" bloggers in Austin, Tex.
] Former Vice President Al Gore gave a speech in Washington laying out his new approach to the entwined challenges of limiting risks from global warming and instability from rising energy prices and declining supplies of fossil fuels.
He calls for the United States to produce all electricity from “carbon-free sources” by 2018 .
This represents quite a shift from his tight focus on the “climate crisis” as the great challenge of our time.
The prepared text is below.
Some Democrats in Congress weren’t thrilled with the timing , according to TheHill.com, given the focus now on pain at the pump.
[
Mr. Obama (written statement): “For decades, Al Gore has challenged the skeptics in Washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat.
I strongly agree with Vice President Gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence, but must fast-track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power, wind power and advanced biofuels, and those are the investments I will make as president.”
Mr. McCain (a spokesman): “John McCain has been a leader in the fight against global climate change, working with Democrats on this issue since 2003, but no one has more successfully recruited Americans into this effort than Al Gore.
This is a key issue, and John McCain has put solutions over partisanship to pursue meaningful, market-driven cap and trade legislation aimed at drastically reducing harmful carbon emissions.”
The climate crisis, in particular, is getting a lot worse – much more quickly than predicted.
Scientists with access to data from Navy submarines traversing underneath the North polar ice cap have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months.
This will further increase the melting pressure on Greenland.
According to experts, the Jakobshavn glacier, one of Greenland’s largest, is moving at a faster rate than ever before, losing 20 million tons of ice every day, equivalent to the amount of water used every year by the residents of New York City.
Andy Revkin - On Arctic ice trends, I have a post coming shortly on the latest update from the world's leading teams of sea ice experts, showing this year's retreat is unlikely to match last year's, while the long-term trend is still heading toward ever less summer ice.
I'll try to find out where the sub data came from.
Only one group I know of has posited an ice-free Arctic Ocean in summers by 2013.
On Greenland, the picture is far more complex than the way it is portrayed here.
Other glaciers have slowed and, overall -- as I've written here recently -- new studies show no fresh signs of imminent destabilization of the ice .

Two major studies from military intelligence experts have warned our leaders about the dangerous national security implications of the climate crisis, including the possibility of hundreds of millions of climate refugees destabilizing nations around the world.
Just two days ago, 27 senior statesmen and retired military leaders warned of the national security threat from an “energy tsunami” that would be triggered by a loss of our access to foreign oil.
Meanwhile, the war in Iraq continues, and now the war in Afghanistan appears to be getting worse.
Andy Revkin - The challenge for Mr. Gore and others trying to boost energy security and limit climate risks at the same time is that the energy gap is here and now , while the worst impacts of climate destabilization still are mainly someday and somewhere..]
And by the way, our weather sure is getting strange, isn’t it?
There seem to be more tornadoes than in living memory, longer droughts, bigger downpours and record floods.
Unprecedented fires are burning in California and elsewhere in the American West.
Higher temperatures lead to drier vegetation that makes kindling for mega-fires of the kind that have been raging in Canada, Greece, Russia, China, South America, Australia and Africa.
Scientists in the Department of Geophysics and Planetary Science at Tel Aviv University tell us that for every one degree increase in temperature, lightning strikes will go up another 10 percent.
And it is lightning, after all, that is principally responsible for igniting the conflagration in California today.
Andy Revkin - Some of the impacts Mr. Gore describes, including rising risks of forest fires, are detailed in a new climate report from the Bush administration .
But why mention tornadoes?
There's been no evidence of an increase in dangerous tornadoes since careful records have been kept (great graphic at this link).
It's really no different stressing "strange" weather in a push for limiting greenhouse gases than doing so to fight the same policy shift.
Remember all the yelling about global cooling because of cool global temperatures recently?
]
Andy Revkin - Mr. Gore appears to have shifted from his original stance that climate change alone was the " planetary emergency " of our time to the multi-pronged view that including it in a basket of reasons to undertake a nonpolluting " energy quest " makes more sense.
This is a position articulated years ago by quite a few scientists, particularly Richard Smalley , the Nobel laureate in chemistry who became an evangelist for an energy revolution before his death from leukemia .

The answer is to end our reliance on carbon-based fuels.
In my search for genuinely effective answers to the climate crisis, I have held a series of “solutions summits” with engineers, scientists, and CEOs.
In those discussions, one thing has become abundantly clear: when you connect the dots, it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever-rising energy prices.
Moreover, they are also the very same solutions we need to guarantee our national security without having to go to war in the Persian Gulf.
What if we could use fuels that are not expensive, don’t cause pollution and are abundantly available right here at home?
We have such fuels.
Scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire world’s energy needs for a full year.
Tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity America uses.
And enough wind power blows through the Midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of US electricity demand.
Geothermal energy, similarly, is capable of providing enormous supplies of electricity for America.
To those who say 10 years is not enough time, I respectfully ask them to consider what the world’s scientists are telling us about the risks we face if we don’t act in 10 years.
The leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis.
When the use of oil and coal goes up, pollution goes up.
When the use of solar, wind and geothermal increases, pollution comes down.
Andy Revkin - Many scientists and engineers have looked to the Apollo program as a metaphor, but stressed that the energy transformation is a far greater challenge.
Here's what one solar expert told me when I interviewed him for a climate story in AARP Magazine : "We already have electricity coming out of everybody’s wall socket,” says Nathan S. Lewis, 51, a chemistry professor who codirects the Powering the Planet project at Caltech.
“This is not a new function we’re seeking.
It’s a substitution.
It’s not like NASA sending a man to the moon.
It’s like finding a new way to send a man to the moon when Southwest Airlines is already flying there every hour handing out peanuts.
"]
We could further increase the value and efficiency of a Unified National Grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug-in electric cars.
An electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car, reduce pollution, and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid.
At the same time, of course, we need to greatly improve our commitment to efficiency and conservation.
That’s the best investment we can make.
Of course, we could and should speed up this transition by insisting that the price of carbon-based energy include the costs of the environmental damage it causes.
I have long supported a sharp reduction in payroll taxes with the difference made up in CO2 taxes.
We should tax what we burn, not what we earn.
This is the single most important policy change we can make.
Andy Revkin - Mr. Gore is sticking with his preference for taxing sources of emissions and limiting costs for citizens that bears no resemblance to "cap and trade" bills like those that have faltered in Congress of late and shares some of the architecture, if not details, of the " cap and dividend " approach of Peter Barnes and a similar proposal from James Hansen , the NASA climate scientist who has moved far into the policy realm lately.
]
In order to foster international cooperation, it is also essential that the United States rejoin the global community and lead efforts to secure an international treaty at Copenhagen in December of next year that includes a cap on CO2 emissions and a global partnership that recognizes the necessity of addressing the threats of extreme poverty and disease as part of the world’s agenda for solving the climate crisis.
We are on the eve of a presidential election.
We are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new president’s term.
It is a great error to say that the United States must wait for others to join us in this matter.
In fact, we must move first, because that is the key to getting others to follow; and because moving first is in our own national interest.
I bet Gore could help by selling his private jet.
That alone contributes to global warming way more than the average American will.
What a hypocrite.
Anyone who listens to him is an idiot!
“…our tendency to offer old solutions to each crisis separately – without taking the others into account.” We need a Works Progress Administration to rebuild infrastructure, provide jobs, etc.
On the policy front, environmental solutions and laws tend always to be single-issue based so that as one problem appears solved another, or more, appear as a result.
Comprehensive integration of issues must occur, as happens in some progressive nations (Netherlands, New Zealand, even the EU, which looks at issues in a wider context.
And lobbyists, the bane of our system, function in the EU, also, except they are balanced by NGOs having equal weight and voice in deliberations.
) The precautionary principle, which we all practice in our daily lives, should be the basic premise for handling natural resources which, after all, are the foundation of everything we do, including business and industry.
I don’t see much annotating here.
How about this: Why do they call Greenland “GREENland” and not “Frozen White Ice Cold Land”?
I understand that from the years 800 to 1300, Greenland enjoyed a mild climate.
Wasn’t that BEFORE the industrial revolution?
Therefore, if glaciers had retreated when there was no manmade carbon-producing industry, variations in climate must be caused by natural factors.
So what is Gore’s evidence that today’s climate variation is NOT natural, organic, and part of Mother Earth’s normal behavior?
Re “our weather sure is getting strange, isn’t it?
There seem to be more tornadoes than in living memory…” Where in the scientific method does one base conclusions on “sure is…strange,” “seem to be,” and “more…than in living memory”?
What exactly is the measure of living memory?
80 years, maybe?
How does that compare to 4 billion years of Earth climate history?
I imagine the so-called Little Ice Age of 1650 through 1850 was “sure strange,” but was that cool period the “normal” climate or were the warmer periods on both sides “normal”?
Answer: The variation is what’s normal.
This is like shooting ducks in a barrel.
I don’t have time to write anymore.

Outsourcing. What does this have to do with Climate?
It was Al Gore who was the point man on the most important free trade agreement (NAFTA) in the past 20 years but apparently he forgot that.
The NSIDC states that the Arctic ice melt began 12 days earlier this year than the average, and 9 days earlier than last year.
[ANDY REVKIN says: Follow the link in my annotation on that point to see the 50-year trends.
Experts say shorter-term variations are meaningless in the climate context, particularly if looking for a link to the greenhouse buildup.

We have in Canada a Government that calls itself Conservative but is really a radical reactionary diodachi that to the puzzlement of the Canadian scientific community hews loyally to the line of the Bush administration on the matter of climate change.
This government is an embarrassment to Canadian scientists who attend international meetings and have to try to explain this daft and illogical situation.
It is dismaying to read that in Washington there are politicians who, for purely political tactical considerations are dismayed that Al Gore has made his statement at this time.
Gore is to be thanked for his devotion to this unavoidable cause.
By 2050 or so, the world population is expected to reach nine billion, essentially adding two Chinas to the number of people alive today.
Those billions will be seeking food, water and other resources on a planet where, scientists say, humans are already shaping climate and the web of life.

Once climate data has been collected and corrected for inhomogeneities, it will need to be analysed.
The aim of any statistical analysis is to identify systematic behaviour in a data set and hence improve understanding of the processes at work to compliment the theory.
Statistical analysis is a search for a signal in the data that can be distinguished from the background noise (see discussion in section 2.4 ).
In climate change research that signal will be a periodic variation, a quasi-periodic variation, a trend, persistence or extreme events in the climate element under analysis ( Figure 3.1 ).
Before undertaking a statistical analysis of a climate record, a number of questions about the task in hand should be asked.
on drought in eastern Australia, it is necessary to firstly identify a representative indicator of El Niño, such as sea surface temperatures in the SE Pacific.
Secondly, a reliable indicator of drought in eastern Australia is required, for example, rainfall.
The data set would need to be of sufficient duration to permit the testing for a relationship on the time scale under consideration, i.e.
does El Niño cause drought in eastern Australia?
Since El Niño has a quasi-periodicity of 2 to 5 years, then a data set of length at least 7 to 10 times this duration (i.e.
up to 50 years) is required to have confidence in the statistical methods.
To investigate longer-term trends, the data requirement becomes more stringent.
Barry & Perry (1973) offer a detailed introduction of the mathematical aspects of statistical analysis, with many useful examples.
Other useful references are provided by Gani (1975) and Godske (1966).
Before concluding this section, however, a couple of points need illustrating.
Firstly, much of what has been said about statistical analysis of instrumental records applies equally well to the study of palaeoclimatology, and to the reconstruction of past climates from proxy data (discussed in the next section).
Secondly, the statistical analysis of climate data serves to compliment and support theories developed to explain the causes (and effects) of climate change.
Statistical associations do not prove cause and effect for they are solely based upon the laws of probability.
When analysing and interpreting climate data in the effort to aid understanding of the causes of climate change, it is necessary to bare this in mind.
One of the biggest problems in any ice core study is determining the age-depth relationship.
Many different approaches have been used and it is now clear that fairly accurate time scales can be developed for the last 10,000 years.
Prior to that, there is increasing uncertainty about ice age.
The problem lies with the fact that the age-depth is highly exponential, and ice flow models (e.g.
Dansgaard & Johnson, 1969) are often needed to determine the ages of the deepest sections of ice cores.
For example, the upper 1000m of a core may represent 50,000 years, whilst the next 50m may span another 100,000 year time period, due to the severe compaction, deformation and flow of the ice sheet in question.
, using 210Pb (lead) (Crozaz & Langway, 1966), 32Si (silicon), 39Ar (argon) (Oeschger et al., 1977) and 14C (carbon) (Paterson et al., 1977) have all been used with varying degrees of success, over different time scales, to determine the age of ice cores.
Certain components of ice cores may reveal quite distinct seasonal variations which enable annual layers to be identified, providing accurate time scales for the last few thousand years.
Such seasonal variations may be found in d18O values, trace elements and microparticles (Hammer et al., 1978).
Where characteristic layers of known ages can be detected, these provide valuable chronostratigraphic markers against which other dating methods can be verified.
So-called reference horizons have resulted from major explosive volcanic eruptions.
These inject large quantities of dust and gases (principally sulphur dioxide) into the atmosphere, where they are globally dispersed.
The gases are converted into aerosols (principally of sulphuric acid) before being washed out in precipitation.
Hence, after major eruptions, the acidity of snowfall increases significantly above background levels (Hammer, 1977).
By identifying highly acidic layers (using electrical conductivity) resulting from eruptions of known age, an excellent means of checking seasonally based chronologies is available.
Global Warming: the Complete Briefing is the most comprehensive guide available to the subject.

This book provides a comprehensive introduction to atmospheric chemistry and the history of discovery of chemicals in the atmosphere, and an accessible discussion of the five major atmospheric pollution topics: urban outdoor air pollution, indoor air pollution, acid deposition, stratospheric ozone reduction, and global climate change.
This highly accessible book introduces and explains the processes causing ozone depletion and global warming, and their environmental connections, examines the measures currently being formulated to tackle them, and considers how effective such measures are likely to be.
In response to increased tectonic activity, atmospheric carbon dioxide may also have been significantly higher during the early Palaeozoic.
Geochemical evidence that links changes in preservation of various species of carbonate minerals with the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in surface waters (and hence the atmosphere) supports this conclusion.
Wilkinson & Given (1986) have estimated that the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide may have been 10 times higher during the early Palaeozoic than at present.
In general, variations in the preservation of marine carbonate species support the sea level/CO
connection assumed for the Phanerozoic (Sandberg, 1983), and Fischer (1982) has correlated these variations (see Figure 5.2 ) to conjectured climate (greenhouse-icehouse) supercycles.
During low sea stands and lower atmospheric CO
climate associated with the expansion of the seaways in the tropics.
It is therefore surprising to find evidence (Frakes, 1979) of global ice growth during the Ordovician Period (about 440Ma), at a time when sea levels were at there highest ( Figure 5.1 ), with presumably CO
concentrations elevated as well.
Considerable ice sheet expansion occurred over northern Africa, at that time situated in the vicinity of the South Pole
affects only annual temperature, rather than the seasonal cycle.
In addition, the continental flooding associated with the early Palaeozoic marine transgression would increase the water surface area, thus reducing further the seasonality, and hence summer temperatures, of the polar region.
Geological evidence (Caputo & Crowell, 1985) appears to support the hypothesis of a coastally situated South Pole.
For most of the Silurian and Devonian Periods (410 to 345Ma), there is no evidence for glaciation (Caputo & Crowell, 1985).
Although the palaeogeography for the Devonian is uncertain, a South Pole located in central Africa would increase seasonality and summer temperatures, thereby preventing the formation of ice sheets (Crowley et al., 1987).
Expansion of land plants also occurred for the first time during the Devonian.
Newly vegetated areas would decrease surface albedo (Posey & Clapp, 1964) allowing increased absorption of short-wave radiation.
The intensification of the hydrological cycle would also influence climate (Shukla & Mintz, 1982).
A second, and larger ice age began towards the end of the Palaeozoic during the Carboniferous Period (about 305Ma), and continued well into the Permian.
Powell & Veevers (1987) have postulated that orogenic uplift in Australia and South America triggered the climatic event.
The aerial extent of glaciation covered much of Gondwanaland, and glacial striations (erosional markings due to the movement of glaciers over bedrock) dating from this time have been found in Antarctica, Australia, Africa, India and South America (see Figure 5.3 ).
Again, it appears that the period of major glaciation was associated with a South Pole located at the edge of the Gondwanan supercontinent (Crowley et al., 1987).
Such a combination of modelling research and empirical reconstruction appears to favour the hypothesis that climate change was driven by tectonic movements.
Additionally, sea levels were at that time falling ( Figure 5.1 ), associated with a slowing down of sea-floor spreading, and presumably a lowering of pCO
Global-mean temperature has increased by around 0.3 to 0.6°C over the past 100 years ( section 6.7.1 ).
At the same time, greenhouse gas concentrations, and atmospheric aerosol loadings have increased substantially ( sections 6.4 and 6.6 ).
To assess whether the two are associated requires the use of model simulations of the likely climatic effects of the changing atmospheric composition, and the comparison of the results with observations.
Three important detection experiments will be discussed here.
Wigley & Barnett (1990) used an energy balance climate model (incorporating upwelling and diffusion within the oceans to account for their radiative damping effect).
The model was forced from 1765 to 1990 using only the changes in greenhouse gas concentrations, and the response could be varied by changing the value of the climate sensitivity
.
In this way, climatic feedbacks (see section 6.9.2 ), not explicitly modelled, can be incorporated into the model.
The model results were qualitatively consistent with the observations on the century time scale ( Figure 6.12 ).
On shorter time scales, the model failed to reproduce the inter-decadal variability of the instrumental record.
Indeed, this caveat has often been used as an argument against the greenhouse hypothesis altogether.
However, Wigley & Barnett (1990) point out that such variability represents the background noise against which the greenhouse signal has to be detected.
Significantly, the observational record seemed to lie at the low climate sensitivity end of the output range of that predicted by GCMs (1.5 to 4.5°C).
However, the situation becomes more complex if other forcing mechanisms, in addition to the enhanced greenhouse effect, are invoked.
If the net century time scale effect of non-greenhouse factors (e.g.
solar variability, volcanism) involved a warming, the climate sensitivity would be less than 1°C.
If their combined effect were a cooling, the sensitivity could be larger than 4°C.
One possible explanation for the decadal time scale discrepancies between the model and observed data is that some other forcing mechanism has been operating which has either offset or reinforced the general warming trend at different times.
Using another energy balance model, Kelly & Wigley (1992) considered solar variability as a possible candidate.
The model was run with a series of sensitivities spanning the accepted range of uncertainty in order to identify the best fit between modelled and observed temperature.
Two sets of forcing histories (determined by a 1-D radiative-convective model) were considered, one involving only the effect of enhanced greenhouse gas concentrations (the IPCC 1990 forcing record), the other including also the negative radiative effect of aerosol loading and stratospheric ozone depletion (the IPCC 1992 forcing record).
doubling temperature (climate sensitivity) and the amount of explained variance in the observational record by each forcing history.
As well as IPCC 1990 and 1992 forcing histories, different solar variables (sunspot number, length on sunspot cycle, solar diameter and rate of change of solar diameter) were considered, and combined with the greenhouse forcing.
Table 6.8 demonstrates that a considerable difference in the best-fit climate sensitivities exists between the two IPCC forcing histories.
If greenhouse forcing alone is considered the CO
doubling temperature is at the low end of the range predicted by GCMs, and is in agreement with Wigley & Barnett (1990).
If the negative forcing of aerosol loading and ozone depletion is also included, the climate sensitivity is much greater.
This result is intuitively correct, since the radiative effects of aerosols and ozone loss would offset the warming due to increased greenhouse gases.
When solar variability is included into the model, the explained variance of the observational record is greater than for greenhouse forcing alone.
This is true for all of the solar variables considered here.
The forcing combination that explains the most variance in the observational record (57%) includes the effects of greenhouse gases, aerosols and ozone depletion, and the rate of change of solar diameter.
The latter, it seems, is accounting for much of the inter-decadal variability in the instrumental record.
doubling temperature.
Thus, it remains difficult to define a precise value for the climate sensitivity.
Ultimately, knowledge of the climate sensitivity provides the key to projecting the future impact of greenhouse gas emissions ( section 6.9 ).
Whilst uncertainty remains (see section 2.8 ), forecasting future climates will remain an imprecise science.
In addition, other possible mechanisms of climate forcing have not been considered.
These could include the effects of volcanism ( section 2.6.3 ), ocean circulation ( section 2.6.4 ) or even the inherent random variability of the climate system.
However, as other potential mechanisms are included into the model, the uncertainty in the climate sensitivity rises.
If sufficient data existed to define the natural level of climate variability prior to human interference, this estimate could be used to attach error margins to the analysis of the greenhouse signal without explicit consideration of the source of the background noise.
Unfortunately, such data do not exit since the period of the instrumental record contains this greenhouse signal.
For the first time, a GCM was able to replicate in broad terms the slow rise in global temperature since the middle of the last century.
If greenhouse gases alone were influencing climate, one would expect global temperatures to have risen by some 0.6 to 1.3°C over the last 100 years (IPCC, 1990a).
By taking into account the anthropogenic sulphate aerosols, the Hadley Centre model simulated a rise in temperature close to the observed 0.5°C.
What makes the experiment so interesting was that the GCM contained simulations of the atmosphere, oceans, ice and vegetation, and can therefore be considered to be a much better representation of the climate system than earlier GCMs, containing only the atmospheric component.
Such a model significantly increased the confidence in scientists' assertion that current global warming is due to an anthropogenically enhanced greenhouse effect, albeit muted by the radiative effects of atmospheric aerosol loading.
Indeed, it was in response to the Hadley Centre model, and similar ones to it more recently,
that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 1995) indicated that the balance of [modelling] evidence suggests a discernible human influence on the global climate does exist.
Nevertheless, in view of the reservations highlighted by Kelly & Wigley (1992) concerning the uncertainty of the climate sensitivity, it remains arguable whether the cause (enhanced greenhouse forcing) and effect (global warming) have been linked unequivocally.
UN Climate Negotiations Kick Off in Poznan is the headline from Climate-L.Org , the "knowledge management project" run by the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD).
(I flagged these meetings last month under IGO Update at the blog.
) Nearly 11,000 folks "from government, business and industry, environmental groups and research institutions" are gathering in Poland for two weeks as a critical intermediate step between last year's meetings in Bali and next year's meetings in Copenhagen.
It will be in Copenhagen in December of 2009, if all goes to plan, that the final international agreement will fall into place to replace the Kyoto Protocol which expires in 2012.
The executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change had some insight into the meetings in this from "Nature Reports , Climate Change" - Interview: Yvo de Boer .
He dampens any undue expectations for these meetings, and rightly so, in this sober and lucid assessment: "This is probably going to be a huge disappointment to many people, but the conference in Poznan is not going to be spectacular.
It's a halfway mark between last year's climate summit in Bali and the next one in Copenhagen, and it's not the moment when things will be finalized.
But what we can expect from Poznan is a clear sense of direction, strong political guidance from ministers, and a much better sense of how the work needs to be managed in 2009 in order to meet that incredibly tight deadline and deliver the political essentials that Copenhagen must deliver.
"
Coal, obviously, is one of the biggest roadblocks to averting catastrophic climate change.
China, the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide, gets 75% of its electric power from coal.
The US, number two on the carbon dioxide hit parade, gets half of its electricity from coal-fired plants.
Worldwide in 2006, coal (and peat) generated 41% of the electricity, according to the International Energy Agency , and 26% of total primary energy supply.
(Oil accounts for 34.4% of TPES.
) I've written about coal here a number of times.
See Coal Takes Some Lumps and King Coal for instance.
I also highly recommend the magisterial Big Coal by Jeff Goodell.
The Center for American Progress recently took a close look at some of the politics, law and policy around coal mining and power production in the US.
Their coverage hangs its hat on the decision by the EPA's Environmental Appeals Board on November 13 that the EPA had no valid reason for failing to place limits on the global warming emissions from a proposed power plant in Utah.
This has tremendous implications not only for this plant but for scores of other proposed facilities throughout the country.
The Sierra Club took the lead on bringing this critical challenge to the EAB and their press release proclaims the decision nothing less than "the start of our clean energy future "
GHG Cap in the UK , MPs pass landmark climate change bill is the story from AFP.
Parliament is mandating an 80% reduction from 1990 levels.
This is the target that President-Elect Obama and environmental leaders in the Congress are seeking.
Not incidentally, the story reports that "Climate change minister Joan Ruddock said she had recently spoken to officials in the US Congress and they had praised the way British lawmakers worked together on such an important issue.
" Ruddock heads the brand new Department of Energy and Climate Change .

UNFCCC , The Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Yvo de Boer , has lauded Barack Obama's recent remarks supporting strong energy and climate change legislation.
(See November 18 just below.
) In talking to, once again, Reuters, de Boer said of Obama's remarks: "I think that will have a very positive influence on the negotiations.
He indicated that he intends to show national and international leadership.
I think that that statement will be seen as a huge signal of encouragement to the international community.

Henry Waxman did it.
Waxman beats Dingell to chair energy committee is the story from Reuters.
In a secret ballot vote of 137 to 122, the Democratic Caucus in the US House of Representatives voted to install a smart, tough, progressive to the chair of the most significant committee (in the House) by far for the critical climate change and energy legislation that is looming in the next Congress.
For all the political punditry on this about Nancy Pelosi’s influence, and the Old Seniority System coming under fire, and the Blue Dogs vs the Freshmen etc, etc, I think there’s another subtext.
(Don’t get me wrong about the punditry here.
Some of the analyses have been very interesting.
)
The big story here, for my money, is that the House is going to be dead serious about the life-and-death issues of energy, the environment and global warming.
Waxman has already offered stronger legislation on climate change than the draft that we’ve seen come out of Energy and Commerce.
Waxman , when he was chairman of the Health and Environment Subcommittee from 1979 to 1994, championed tough environmental legislation, and often had to battle with John Dingell tooth and nail to get it through.
This vote indicates that the House Democrats want legislation that is going to be better and, frankly, less given to cater to the special interests of Detroit, the extractive industries and the utilities.
The House Democrats, many of whom are going to be Freshmen and Sophmores, want to push the edge of the envelope.
I think Nancy Pelosi wants that.
I think Barack Obama and many Senate Democrats do too.
There are, to be sure, any number of Republicans in the House and Senate who want smart, tough legislation going forward as well.
This video from President-Elect Barack Obama talking to the attendees at the Governors' Global Climate Summit is unequivocal.

With constrained resources , to say the least , as we struggle through the world recession that is upon us, in the US, " some kind of charge or auctioning for carbon permits may suddenly take on new attractiveness, not just for combating climate change but as a revenue-raising measure for a federal government that certainly needs the money.
" This if, for my money, a compelling argument for a federal cap-and-trade regime and/or a carbon tax that will help support government activities in hard times, including extending federal lifelines to local and state governments.

I did the right thing today and brought some electronic waste downtown to a Department of Sanitation drop-off site.
I can't say that I'm impressed with New York City's program in this.
The advertising was poor - you really had to search for it even at their website.
Plus, there were far too few locations in each of the five boroughs and this all only happens periodically.
Recycling, I'm sorry to say, has never been a top priority of the city administration at any point.
There have been various times when the impulse has flowered compared to others when the City has dragged its feet.
I would not say, however, that the full potential here has ever been anywhere near embraced.
(I like to plug my grand scheme at this point , Urban Gold , which I shopped around a few years back and for which I got a pretty fair hearing in a number of places.
)
I do want to flag a really compelling article from National Geographic magazine from last January - High-Tech Trash .
Aside from the article itself, and the always superb photographs, NGM's website has some in-depth features including this interactive look at all the toxic components of a computer and monitor.
There's also a section on how you can reduce e-waste.
See also EPA's "eCycling" webpage .
Followup: See this excellent article on the life cycle of computers from GreenerComputing News - How Activists Are Forcing Change in Green IT .
This is precisely what the doctor ordered: tremendous built-in reductions in electronic waste as a direct consequence of paying attention to the life cycle.
Governors' Global Climate Summit , The Governator, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, will host US governors and some top international policymakers on climate change and energy in LA next week.
Governors taking part in this event include Charlie Crist from Florida, Jim Doyle from Wisconsin, Rod Blagojevich from Illinois, and Kathleen Sebelius from Kansas.
Schwarzenegger, not incidentally, has been mentioned as a possible Obama administration Energy Secretary and Sebelius has been mentioned for EPA.
This looks to be an exciting conference.
It's being webcast by UCTV so if you can't make it out to LA, tune in here or visit later for archival video.
As far as the climate change crisis goes, you should check out this excellent piece from the Worldwatch Institute - Opinion: Building A Green Economy .
Here's a capsule of their view: "The perfect storm of today's economic, environmental, and social ravages requires a robust, multi-pronged response.
Indeed, the challenge for global political leadership, including U.S. President-elect Obama, is not merely to kickstart the global economy, but to do so in a way that creates jobs and stabilizes climate, increases food output using less water and pesticides, and generates prosperity with greater equality of incomes.
"
Carbon Market Insights Americas 2008 , This is a terrific conference going on in Washington this week.
It's being coordinated by Point Carbon and the Pew Center on Global Climate Change , both superb organizations in the forefront of the action.
(I would've loved to have made this conference, but I had other cats to whip, as the French say so disarmingly.
)
Here is some of their thinking behind the second report: "Regional programs across North America would potentially create markets with a volume close to 900 million tons by 2012 , almost half the size of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS).
At a conservative price of $10 per ton of carbon dioxide, this would open up billions of dollars worth of transactions and considerable business opportunities.
"
Poland , The major international climate change meetings of the year are taking place in Poznan, December 1 through 12.
This is the last "Conference of the Parties" (COP) to the UNFCCC before the critical COP in Copenhagen in December of 2009.
(Here is Poland's website for the conference as well.
)
In the wake of the momentum built by the Bali meetings last year, and the critical IPCC Fourth Assessment Report and other developments, and with an eye on Copenhagen, Poznan will be a launching pad for a "plan of action and programmes of work" and to further a ""shared vision' for a new climate change regime.
" Very interested participants and observers will certainly include members of Congress and staff, as well as key players in the next administration.
Copenhagen will be where the international treaty to replace the Kyoto Protocol will be finalized.
This upcoming meeting and subsequent discussions that will take place in 2009 may very well mean life or death.
Hyperbole is always a danger but when you are talking about global warming, as we've seen here and on which we're getting more alarming evidence by the week, life and death is not too strong an expression.
Carbon Finance , World Bank Creates Green Bond to Finance Mitigation and Adaptation is the headline from Climate-L.org , an excellent "knowledge management project for international negotiations and related activities on climate change" run by the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD).
The World Bank's press release notes that this is a "partnership with SEB and several key Scandinavian institutional investors to raise funds for projects seeking to mitigate climate change or help affected people adapt to it.
" SEB is a bank based in Sweden.
Not incidentally, the World Bank's Carbon Finance Unit does very good work and is a tremendous source of information.
I've also made reference to this critical aspect of the fight against global warming a good number of times.
See Carbon Markets .
Stamps , The UN has issued climate change stamps.
They're quite handsome and come in different denominations.
You can go here to see them and to order.
They're a creation of the photographer Gary Braasch who has been doing some superb work documenting the impacts of climate change.
Wal-Mart is working with EDF on their Green Supply Chain Initiative .
In the "FT" article, the head of the Wilson Center's China Environment Forum indicated that " in China similar pressure from international companies could help counter the problems of enforcement that continue to dog central government efforts to enforce existing environmental laws.
" In a follow-up article, Wal-Mart orders Chinese suppliers to lift standards , we learn ""Meeting social and environmental standards is not optional,' Lee Scott, Wal-Mart's chief executive, told a gathering of more than 1,000 suppliers in Beijing.
" Wal-Mart's pretty serious about sustainability, as evidenced by their CEO's somewhat unequivocal statement, as well as by their website .
Back in my NYSDEC days, we always highlighted the primacy of " waste reduction " as the first in the order of things to do with solid or hazardous waste.
McCain has a track record on climate change.
He was one of the first, and still among the relatively few, Congressional Republicans to support a cap-and-trade regime.
See his campaign website for more on his view .
He could and should play the role in the Senate, and beyond that, in his party, of an outspoken proponent of tough climate change legislation.
Given their losses on Tuesday, the Republican Party could very well circle the wagons and let extremists like Jim Inhofe lead their efforts, as they allowed him to do for several years while he was the Environment and Public Works Committee Chair.
One of the most prominent moderate Republican proponents of a cap-and-trade regime, John Warner, has left the Senate.
So it could very well fall to McCain, and I think to the outspokenly progressive moderate Republican Senators from Maine, Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe, to help bring their caucus into line with the stunning reality of what we’re up against.
Epic Battle in the House - As I’ve noted here any number of times, the House Energy and Commerce Committee and its powerful chair, John Dingell, have a huge amount of juice when it comes to climate change and energy legislation.
See this and this , for instance, for some background from me at the blog, and this from the Committee website on Dingell and climate change.
At first blush, you might think this is a surprise, but if you look back at nearly 30 years of history, you’ll see that Waxman and Dingell have been butting heads for a while.
From 1979 to 1994, Rep. Waxman chaired the Subcommittee on Health and the Environment.
Waxman was one of the principal architects of the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments that, among other things, introduced the acid rain title that was the first deployment of a cap-and-trade regime.
When I was working on acid rain back in the 1980’s with the Sierra Club, their battles were already legendary.
Waxman is tough, smart and a progressive.
He’s got a good claim to the chairmanship.
If you think that his presence in that role will help drive strong legislation further and faster, then you’ve got to be rooting for him.
Suffice it to say, he is in Speaker Pelosi’s inner circle and would not be making this bid without her blessing.
See Waxman’s bio here and the webpage devoted to his work on global warming legislation.
Internationally, Obama has said that he would ask Al Gore to take a leading role in helping to shape the US position on climate change.
“I will make a commitment that Al Gore will be at the table and play a central part in us figuring out how we can solve this problem,” was what he said in April according to this from DeSmogBlog.
Forests - I don’t think I’ve adequately covered the subject of forest loss and its extraordinary impact on warming.
20% of warming induced by people comes from forest destruction.
I mentioned the extraordinary losses in Borneo in the last post below.
We’ve also touched on some incredible potential for carbon sequestration in the heart of the Amazon rainforest in the nurturing of “terra preta” here in August.
We also looked at the REDD movement - “Reducing emissions from deforestation and ecosystem degradation.” - here and here in June.
The IPCC also looked at the GHG mitigation potential for forests here in their Fourth Assessment Report last year.
Critical momentum has been building for some time on addressing forest loss.
Although the Kyoto Protocol did not address this key issue, the negotiators at the key international meetings in Bali last year did.
See Bali delegates agree to support forests-for-climate (REDD) plan .
Meanwhile, as I noted in my post on the House Energy and Commerce draft climate change bill here : “Another noteworthy point is that the draft makes international reforestation and afforestation projects eligible for offsets.” These two key constituencies, the UNFCCC negotiators and John Dingell’s powerful House committee, are going to have an awful lot of influence on the shape of federal and international law in the next couple of years.
Cities - I had a lot to say in May of 2007 on the C40 Large Cities Climate Summit.
This was a great conference with one smart, motivated, focused heavy-hitting speaker after another.
(Start here .
) The C40 group aims “to create long-term international collaborations among large cities in order to drive down carbon emissions and encourage cities to work with businesses and national governments to accelerate action on climate change.” They’ve done great work in only just a few years.
They’ve been having a series of meetings this year in anticipation of the next summit , taking place in Seoul in May.
The latest meeting took place in Tokyo in October to discuss adaptation measures for cities.
See also this AFP piece: Cities pledge action on climate change .
The C40 is not alone in their focus and effectiveness.
I mentioned the U.S. Conference of Mayors in my post below from October 26 and ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability has been doing great work for years, including with their Cities for Climate Protection (CCP) Campaign.
I’m an old urban environmentalist and so I pay attention to these initiatives.
So should you because there’s so much bang for the buck in our cities.
European Union - The leaders of the 27-member EU met in Brussels last month and one of the critical discussions centered around climate change.
Keeping the EU’s ambitious renewables and climate change trajectory moving onward and upward is going to be difficult in the precarious economic times we’re in now.
Reuters put it this way in this article : “The meeting in Brussels had been expected to focus on how the EU would reach its goal of cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent by 2020, but was overtaken by failing banks, plunging stock markets and warnings of recession.” The EU issued a progress report on how the countries are doing on meeting the Kyoto targets saying they’re on track.
But it’s going to be very tough for some countries, particularly those in Eastern Europe that rely on coal.
See Uphill struggle for coal-fired Poland from the “FT.” At the summit in Brussels, these concerns were taken into account.
“European officials argue that they have already taken into account the challenges faced by Poland and other members of the “coalition of the unwilling”.
For example, the climate package calls for 10 per cent of the trading scheme’s auction revenues to be redistributed to poorer countries.”
Solar Thermal - A modest 5 MW plant opening in the California desert is very much a harbinger of more to come.
Ausra Opens its First Concentrating Solar Power Plant in California is another story from EERE.
I wrote about Ausra here last March.
I said then “Ausra’s website has some terrific graphics, well worth seeing, and some fun speculation: “Solar Thermal Power Could Supply Over 90 percent of U.S. Grid Plus Auto Fleet.’” Talk about bullish on CSP!
“Flexible” Carbon-To-Liquid Fuel Process - According to researchers at Purdue University, we could be producing “alternative fuels, hydrogen and electricity from municipal solid wastes, agricultural wastes, forest residues and sewage sludge that could supply up to 20 percent of transportation fuels in the United States annually.” See this from “CarbonFree” and this from Purdue.
These sorts of pyrolysis or gasification plants have extraordinary potential.
(I envisioned them once in the context of a comprehensive proposal for New York City’s modest 25,000 tons a day of municipal solid waste and called the plan, Urban Gold .
The heart of the strategy is to co-locate a materials recovery facility [MRF] and other waste disposal facilities, such as pyrolysis or gasification plants, with industries that would use the recycled materials as feedstock for their manufacturing.
)
As I think I may have said before, without China, folks, getting a handle on global warming ain’t going nowhere.
Seems to me like they’re very much in the game.
Check out the article for more good news.
Here are some great stories from major media that merit a look.
Beyond these stories, these publications have consistently great coverage on climate change and matters directly relevant to our subject.
There’s also a book here for your consideration.
Borneo seems a microcosm of much of what’s wrong in the world: our appetite for energy and cheap consumer goods, our disdain for biodiversity and the lives of indigenous peoples, and our indifference to rainforest destruction and how that relates to global warming.
The photographs and video remind me of the havoc wreaked in Appalachia, another breathtakingly wild and diverse environment, by mountaintop removal coal mining.
(See last post below.
)
There’s another compelling story at NGM, on light pollution: Our Vanishing Night .
The excellent environmental writer, Verlyn Klinkenborg, writes about the surprisingly enormous burden imposed on wildlife by the lights of cities and industrial complexes , even fishing fleets.
As an urban dweller (a small metropolis called New York City), I can attest to the fact that we’ve got too much light.
The article references the work of the International Dark-Sky Association , a nonprofit “dedicated to protecting and preserving the nighttime environment and our heritage of dark skies through quality outdoor lighting.” See also the Dark Sky Society .
I’ve noted the amazing, now-annual phenomenon of Earth Hour .
Light pollution not only disrupts the natural cycles of wildlife, it also sucks thousands of megawatts of power, unnecessarily, from our grids, hugely exacerbating global warming.
Simple stuff, it seems to me.
The NY Review of Books - This eminently intelligent and readable periodical has had, like NGM and many others, more and more to say about climate change.
Their go-to environmentalist is the incomparable Bill McKibben.
(See any number of references I’ve made to him and his writing at the blog, including talking about the “Step It Up 2007″ campaign.
)
An example of praise: “His basic policy guidelines, and most of his specific suggestions, for managing this crucial transition are sound.” McKibben here notes another useful insight: “Friedman knows that innovation in the financial services industry will be almost as important as progress in engineering.” But McKibben also derides Friedman for, for all intents and purposes, dismissing the important arena of international climate regimes: What was finalized in Kyoto and what will be, ostensibly, finalized in Copenhagen in December 2009 to replace the existing protocol, are of utmost importance.
“Der Spiegel” - This venerable German periodical has a most useful section devoted to Climate Change here .
For a particularly good and well-informed look at what’s going on in Germany and Europe, you should check in here from time to time.
DK - Dorling Kindersley has a fabulous series of “Eyewitness” books that illustrate all sorts of important subjects with interesting text and eye-catching, vivid graphics.
When I visited the AMNH exhibit on climate change (see post below from Oct. 20), I picked up their new volume Eyewitness Climate Change .
This is great for kids, particularly, but it’s perfectly great reading for adults too.
It’s quite informative, very good at making some complex ideas accessible.
With a CD-ROM of clip art, and a great poster too, you can’t miss.
Nukes , I want to flag two recent articles by the venerable Matthew Wald at the "NY Times" on the state of nuclear power in the US.
A Cautious Approach to Nuclear Power from September and Nuclear Power May Be in Early Stages of a Revival .
As I think I've made clear here , I'm a longtime nuclear power antagonist and I've seen little over the past 35 years to make me change my view.
Even the specter of catastrophic climate change impacts can't get me there.
What strikes me in these two articles is the reiteration of the concerns regarding the extraordinary capital costs involved, the persistent lack of real technical and political progress on the safe storage of waste, and the recognition of the looming opposition to new individual nuclear power plants.
The Union of Concerned Scientists , with whom I did a little work on opposing a plant in Wisconsin back in the mid-1970's, is quoted in the second of Wald's articles.
"David A. Lochbaum, a nuclear engineer, said it was too soon to say that opposition was weaker now than during construction of the older plants, when grandmothers tried to block bulldozers.
"We've got the grandmothers; we just don't have the bulldozers.
There's not the Kodak moment that a lot of these protests need.
'"
Two GHGs On the Increase , This story from the AP, courtesy of the "Star Tribune" of Minneapolis-St. Paul, warns that two potent greenhouse gases, methane and nitrogen trifluoride, are a growing concern.
My post on Nitrogen from early September , and more specifically the comment there , touched on nitrogen trifluoride, a critical component in the manufacture of High-Def TVs.
Two researchers at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography have done groundbreaking work on the prevalence of this potent GHG.
See this release from Scripps.
Given the growing use of this chemical and its potential for serious damage, it will need to be included in the list of greenhouse gases that the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change regulates.
We've looked at methane several times, most recently in Permafrost (Or Not) .
The AP story says: "After almost eight years of stability, atmospheric methane levels ‚ measured every 40 minutes by monitors near remote coastal cliffs ‚ suddenly started rising in 2006.
The amount of methane in the air has jumped by nearly 28 million tons from June 2006 to October 2007.
There is now more than 5.6 billion tons of methane in the air.
"
Green Schools , I'll leave you with one upbeat story.
(My ratio of bad news to good news is usually higher than in this post.
) "The U.S. Conference of Mayors has formed the "Mayors’ Alliance for Green Schools,' which will work with the U.S. Green Building Council " according to this article at "GreenerBuildings.
" The international movement to increase the energy efficiency and to maximize the use of clean energy in our built environment is critical, and I've reported on it any number of times here .
Schools are a logical place to walk the walk on the environment and energy and enable students to both live and learn the important lessons of how to create a sustainable world.
See also the American College & University Presidents Climate Commitment .
If you haven't made up your mind and want to see how McCain and Obama are on climate change and the environment, some of this material might help you.
If you have made up your mind, this stuff might give you an idea of how President Obama or President McCain might pursue matters of the environment and energy.
The excellent "Nature Reports , Climate Change" had a news feature last month, US elections: the candidates on climate .
The campaigns responded to a number of very good questions such as "In order to reach a global climate change agreement in Copenhagen in 2009, do you believe that the United States should take the lead on signing up to international binding emissions targets?
And how should the United States proceed if China and India do not initially agree to such a mandate?
" The good folks at "Nature" also know very well how dependent any solutions in the US are on how Congress grapples with the complex and politically thorny issues at hand.
I've written here a great deal about Congress and climate change, energy, and the environment, most recently about the draft cap-and-trade proposal in the House and the wild ride that the tax credits for renewables had.
See US elections: Challenges in Congress from "Nature.
" See also this thoughtful editorial from their Olive Heffernan.
There's also this very good summary of the Presidential candidates' positions from the "NY Times" and Andy Revkin, as well as this head-to-head look at key facets of the important questions on climate change.
China - You will have noted that the PRC surpassed the USA this past year in total carbon dioxide emissions.
I referenced this here a couple of weeks ago and referred to the “NY Times” article that fleshed out the whys and the wherefores.
Clearly then, China needs to be at the table on climate change.
For all the considerable, wholly justified alarm about China's exploding GHG emissions, they also seem to be concerned as well.
China calls for help on climate change , from Reuters, says that President Hu Jintao recently “…urged organizations and companies to optimize energy use, recycle resources, increase forest coverage, explore water resources scientifically and strengthen international cooperation” in a quest to reduce risk from climate change.
China, like India, has taken part in recent G8-related talks and will attend the climate talks at the G8 Summit next week.
(See previous post.
) See also the climate change coverage from Xinhua, the Chinese news agency, including Hu's speech.
Meanwhile, the AFP reports here “UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon told China on Tuesday to accept its global responsibilities on climate change, as he began a three-day visit to the world's most populous nation.” The SG also met today with the Global Compact China Network and said: “By investing and planning today for a future that protects our planet, Chinese business has an opportunity to be a true front-runner.
I’m sure Chinese businesses will not wait for the long and complex intergovernmental agreements to be finalized, but rather engage pro-actively in China and elsewhere in the world to pave the way for a low-carbon path to prosperity.” (See the speech .
)
The Chinese still get 70% of their electricity from coal.
Can they really get some traction on their addiction to a massively environmentally destructive practice like burning coal?
It's not only the GHG problem, it's also the soot and other pollutants like sulfur dioxide and mercury.
(See Black Carbon and Solar Cookers from April.
) It's also the auto industry.
It's also heavily polluting industries like cement making that are breaking the climate change bank.
Can they stay focused and keep energy efficiency and renewables in play?
Let's also see what, if anything, comes out of the G8 summit.
It's all part of the intricately spun web of international climate change politics that is being spun from Kyoto to Bali to Washington to Beijing to Brussels to Hokkaido and to Copenhagen in December of 2009.
Figure 4.1: Evolution of approaches to carbon sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems.
Previous assessments (e.g., IPCC, 1996) tended to focus on ecological processes and potentials, and treated economic and social factors as constraints (A).
A slightly different viewpoint considers the three dimensions as mutually reinforcing and seeks to maximize the overlaps (B).
Land is used to raise crops, graze animals, harvest timber and fuel, collect and store water, create the by-ways of travel and the foundations of commerce, mine minerals and materials, dispose of our wastes, recreate people’s bodies and souls, house the monuments of history and culture, and provide habitat for humans and the other occupants of the earth.
Can land, and water, also be managed to retain more carbon, and thereby mitigate the increasing concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO
The atmosphere now contains about 760 billion tonnes (gigatonnes = Gt) of carbon as CO
, an amount that has increased by an average of 3.3 ± 0.2GtC each year throughout the 1990s, mostly from combustion of fossil fuels (IPCC, 2000a).
Atmospheric C represents only a fraction (~ 30%) of the C in terrestrial ecosystems; vegetation contains nearly 500GtC, while soils contain another 2000 GtC in organic matter and detritus (Schimel, 1995; WBGU, 1998) as cited in Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) (IPCC, 2000a).
Table 4.1 provides estimates of the carbon stocks in terrestrial ecosystems now.
The Second Assessment Report (SAR) of the IPCC (1996) suggested that 700Mha of forestland might be available for carbon conservation globally – 138Mha for slowed tropical deforestation, 217Mha for regeneration of tropical forests, and 345Mha for plantations and agroforestry.
The IPCC suggested that by 2050 this area could provide a cumulative mitigation impact of 60 to 87GtC, of which 45 to 72GtC in the tropics.
Towards the end of this time interval, the mitigation impact could approach a maximum rate of 2.2GtC/yr.
The cost of mitigation (excluding land and other transaction costs) was envisioned to be about 2 to 8US$/tC.
The SAR (IPCC, 1996) further suggested that, over the next 50 years, an additional 0.4 and 0.8GtC could be sequestered per year in agricultural soils, with the adoption of appropriate management practices.
The current report, while supporting many of these earlier findings, provides a broader evaluation of the potential for management of C stocks in the biosphere ( Figure 4.1 ).
Recent studies, for example, suggest that costs may often be higher than estimated earlier, particularly when opportunity costs of the land are included.
In addition, the issue of “leakage” (where actions at one site influence actions elsewhere, a problem not considered by the SAR) is examined.
This report considers forests, grasslands, croplands, and wetlands, and, where possible, examines all C pools within them.
Carbon mitigation is evaluated as one of many services provided by ecosystems.
The objectives of this chapter are to review progress made since the IPCC-SAR, and to evaluate prospects for storing more carbon in ways that ensure the continued provision of other goods and services from the varied and finite land resources.
The aim of this chapter is not to assess specifically the implications of the Kyoto Protocol (UNFCCC, 1997), a mandate assigned to the IPCC Special Report on LULUCF (IPCC, 2000a).
Rather, it seeks to provide a broader scientific view of the prospects and problems of land management for carbon sequestration, unconstrained by the limited scope of the Kyoto Protocol.
This chapter begins by describing the current state of land use, the history of land use, ongoing changes in land use, pressures driving these changes, and potential competition among demands for land ( Section 4.3 ).
It then considers opportunities for enhanced C stocks, especially in forestry and agriculture ( Section 4.4 ).
Having identified possible C conservation measures, the physical, environmental, social, and economic impacts of these measures are examined; and assessment is made of how they augment or compete with other services provided by land (Sections 4.5 - 4.7 ).
How these options might be evaluated and, where appropriate, encouraged (Sections 4.8 ) is also considered.
Finally, the prospects for managing marine ecosystems to increase carbon sequestration, and the possibility of managing the global ecosystem by ‘geo-engineering’ of the earth’s energy balance are considered.
Tropical forests were largely intact until colonial times, when large tracts were removed to provide raw materials for railroads, ships, etc., in the period following the industrial revolution.
The loss of tropical forests escalated in the second half of the 20th century.
According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO, 1996), about 15.4 million ha of natural tropical forests are lost each year.
Of this, 42% occurs in Latin America, 31% in Africa, and 27% in Asia.
Brunner et al.
(1998) estimated tropical deforestation at 19.1 million ha/yr during the period 1990 to 1995.
There has, however, been a large increase in area devoted to forest plantations.
By 1990, there were 61.3 million ha under plantations and the rate of establishment is now about 3.2 million ha/yr (FAO, 1996).
As pointed out by the IPCC (IPCC, 1996) global estimates of C emissions from deforestation have remained highly uncertain and show high geographical variability.
The magnitude of forest regeneration (particularly secondary forest regrowth and regrowth of abandoned lands) and forest degradation processes is not well documented.
Improving the accuracy of these estimates remains an urgent and challenging task (Houghton et al., 2000).
A review of scenarios of future land-use changes in the tropics, and their implications for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, shows a wide range of estimates, particularly for the first part of the 21st century, where estimates differ by a factor of 14 (Alcamo and Swart, 1998).
These disparities reflect a lack of agreement on the definition of deforestation, and a lack of knowledge and agreement on the estimation of C emissions (Alcamo and Swart, 1998).
These scenarios can be divided into two groups: in one group emissions decline smoothly after 1990; in the other group emissions increase for a few decades after 1990.
The rates and causes of land-use change vary by region and scale (Kaimowitz and Angelsen, 1998).
Deforestation is often considered a one way process, but the landscape is a dynamic mosaic of land uses and vegetation types, with transitions both to and away from forest (Houghton et al., 2000).
Natural factors, such as forest fires and pests, as well as socio-economic processes, many of which are not seen at the local level, interact in complex ways, complicating analysis.
Understanding the causes of this mosaic of land-use and/or land-cover transitions in order to understand and predict the net effect on deforestation rates and C emissions remains a key research challenge.
Conversion of forests to pasture and cropland has been the most important proximal cause of tropical deforestation.
Non-sustainable logging has been the leading factor in parts of Southeast Asia, whereas excessive harvest of wood fuel has been important only in specific sub-country regions and in some African countries (Kaimowitz and Angelsen, 1998).
According to Bawa and Dayanandan (1997), the causes (correlates) of deforestation are many and varied, with complex interactions.
Overall, Bawa and Dayanandan found that population density, cattle density, and external debt were the key factors.
In Africa, the most important factors were extraction of fuelwood and charcoal and demand for cropland; in Asia, it was cropland; and in Latin America, it was cattle density.
The rate of population growth is now apparently declining, but the population, and hence the demand for food and other land services, is still growing (Roberts, 1999).
Population growth has been widely cited as a major cause of deforestation (Myers, 1989), but the relationship between population and deforestation is not simple.
Population growth exerts increasing pressure on resources, but whether these pressures lead to forest degradation or to positive changes (e.g., afforestation, improved forest management, and better technology) depends largely on social structure.
Extensive migration may also lead to deforestation and soil erosion.
Simplistic assumptions about population and deforestation also do not apply where high population densities and/or growth rates are accompanied by forest conservation and reforestation programmes.
In India, for example, deforestation rates have declined since 1980, despite population growth, owing to effective forest conservation legislation (Ravindranath and Hall, 1994).
Patterns that affect land-use are changed by economic development.
Affluence usually increases consumption, but it does not necessarily decrease terrestrial C stocks.
The maintenance of ecosystems tends to improve with increasing and better distribution of wealth, as well as with proper institutional structures and sound development strategies.
The demand for and interest in forests and their services is the driving force for the technological and economic capacity to maintain forests.
Also, wealthy societies tend to be urbanized and this may reduce destructive pressures on forests.
Technological development provides efficient tools for land-use change and for high-value, alternative uses.
Technology can also limit encroachment.
As seen by the “green revolution” in agriculture, technological development can increase productivity on intensively managed land, thereby releasing other land areas from agriculture (Waggoner, 1994).
Nevertheless, there is always the risk of leakage (i.e., tendencies to transfer destructive operations from the developed to less developed areas and countries), or the possibility that technology development and transfer will have positive spillover effects (Brown et al., 2000; Noble et al., 2000)
Land-use change is driven largely by efforts perceived as “best and highest” use of the land.
But benefits of the land that are non-market and/or external to the direct user (e.g., watershed protection, biodiversity, and carbon mitigation) may be ignored by land managers.
For example, the decision to convert forestland to agriculture may ignore the many external and non-market benefits lost.
Moreover, where long-term land rights are insecure, lands may be used to generate short-term benefits, with disregard for long-term benefits.
Factors related to social structure and political economy have not been studied widely, but studies at the country and regional levels suggest that deforestation is favoured by the following factors: growing landlessness and persistent inequalities in access to land, insecure land tenure, land speculation, rising external debt, large-scale expansion in commercial agriculture, erosion of traditional systems of resource management and community control, and widespread migration of impoverished people to ecologically fragile areas (Hecht, 1985; Palo and Uusivuori, 1999; Tole, 1998).
"Earth's Climate: Past and Future" works as either a nonmajors introduction to Earth system science or climate change, or as a majors/graduate-level overview of the processes and techniques in climate science.
Written from a multidisciplinary perspective by a researcher/instructor in the field, the text summarizes the major lessons to be learned from 550 million years of climate changes, as a way of evaluating the climatological impact on and by humans in this century.
The book also looks ahead to possible effects during the next several centuries of fossil fuel use.
This review is from: Earth's Climate: Past and Future (Paperback)
In Earth's Climate, William Ruddiman has described in detail a very wide range of factors that have influenced climate changes over a range of scales in geological history, and which will continue to have an effect on global climates into the future.
The book is excellently presented, and is one of the most comprehensive on these topics I have seen.
Many of the images from the text, along with other resources, are available on a CD-ROM that accompanies the book, and also on a website for fno charge.
The author highlights a number of further references for each topic, generally articles and books which are seminal to the field.
He also uses boxes highlighting key terms, interactions with other book sections and review questions, all of which combine to give the reader a thorought understanding of the main issues, and the opportunity to research further any points of major interest.
The book would be to use to university members from undergraduate to post-doctoral level and beyond, and is both an excellent teaching and learning aid.
I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone in the very broad field of climate dynamics.
No issue throws off more apprehension and confusion among a certain set than does global warming.
Since the Norwegians last year propelled Al Gore’s film documentary, “An Inconvenient Truth,” into the stratosphere by awarding half a Nobel Peace Prize to the former presidential candidate ..., the proposition that continuing industrialization is going to require some extensive mitigation of its effects on the atmosphere has become much more widely accepted.
Those with an interest in Nordhaus's history of involvement in global warming will be interested in, "From Chicken Little to Dr. Pangloss: William Nierenberg, Global Warming, and the Social Deconstruction of Scientific Knowledge," by
Those with an interest in Nordhaus's history of involvement in global warming...
Although I always recommend The Death of Environmentalism for good examples of Nordhaus ideas.
And I recommend this video from Oreskes on the history of climate change denialism and the industry funding behind much of the denialism.
So that means Nordhaus shows that a poorly implemented climate change policy could do more than 3x as much net harm, compared to the net benefits of even a theoretically optimal carbon tax.
And I recommend this video from Oreskes on the history of climate change denialism and the industry funding behind much of the denialism.
That is a crucial difference between the atmospheric modeling of what CO2 will do, and these long range economic argument about what it will all mean.
... the Environmental Economics blog ... is now the default homepage on my browser (but then again, I guess I am a wonk -- a word I learned on the E.E.
blog). That is a very nice service to the profession.
4.2.4 Changes in Global Climate and Other Indirect Human Effects
Evaluating the long-term outcome of carbon mitigation activities will require estimating how carbon reservoirs will change in the future.
Carbon stocks sequestered through mitigation activities today may be more or less secure, depending on how the environment changes and how society adapts to those changes.
Estimating future C stocks in ecosystems is complicated by our inability to predict the magnitude and impact of impending changes in the environment.
Some of the possible changes favour larger C stocks; others would lead to smaller stocks.
The impact of global climate change on future C stocks is particularly complex.
These changes may result in both positive and negative feedbacks on C stocks (Houghton et al., 1998).
For example, increases in atmospheric CO
concentrations may also suppress decomposition of stored C, because C/N ratios in residues may increase and because more C may be allocated below ground (Owensby, 1993; Morgan et al., 1994; Van Ginkel et al., 1996; Torbert et al., 1997).
Predicting the long-term influence of elevated CO
concentrations on the C stocks of forest ecosystems remains a research challenge (Bolin et al., 2000; Prentice et al., 2001).
Over the long term, as climate gradually changes, the time scales for adaptation of ecosystems to climatic conditions will become important.
Vegetation types (and other organisms) have adapted to the combination of site conditions, including climate, where they now occur.
It cannot be assumed that tree growth will increase with climate change, or that the plant populations will remain optimally adapted to their current sites.
Analysis of provenance (seed source) data, in the light of global change, indicates either no net increase in growth rate as a result of warming or small decreases in growth rate.
Trees may be under more stress in a changed climate, leaving them more susceptible to insects and diseases.
The various processes of environmental change may occur over different time periods and with varying intensity at different locations.
Ecosystems that initially absorb C in response to higher atmospheric CO
if increasing temperatures lead to enhanced decomposition and respiration (Cao and Woodward, 1998; Scholes et al., 1999).
Fires and other disturbances could increase in frequency and intensity if temperatures increase and precipitation patterns change.
The net impact of these, and other global changes, is an area of active research (e.g., Hungate et al., 1997; Kauppi et al., 1997; Norby and Cotrufo, 1998; Woodwell et al., 1998).
The effects of climate change on mitigation activities in the terrestrial biosphere are difficult to anticipate, as they are dependent on the timing and the specific spatial character and distribution of changes.
Present climate scenarios are neither spatially nor temporally very precise, and averages over the scale of typical global circulation climate models are inadequate for estimating impacts on very specific, localized mitigation activities.
Moreover, the responses of ecosystems are dependent on the ecological mechanisms, the climate change imposed, and the management responses to these factors.
For example, planting of species adapted to present conditions may be inappropriate for future conditions and the species might grow more slowly under chronic climate change.
Conversely, species planted for an anticipated future climate may not be able to survive current variations.
Climate change can also affect the economic and social dimensions of land use and forestry.
Currently, productive lands may become less productive and less attractive for food and fibre production.
The current patterns of land use and disturbance could change.
Model results reported by Darwin et al.
(1995, 1996) and others suggest, for example, that conversion from forestland to cropland is a significant adaptive response to climate change in some regions.
Protection from fire or insect and/or disease predation, in boreal regions especially, may become increasingly hard to maintain.
Reliable estimates of risks to, or enhancements of, mitigation activities carried out today will require increased understanding of the interactions between the important ecological, economic, and social impacts of climate change.
As described in this chapter, the carbon stocks in terrestrial ecosystems respond to a combination of ecological, economic, and social drivers.
That will not change even if the global environment changes.
Solar Thermal - A modest 5 MW plant opening in the California desert is very much a harbinger of more to come.
Ausra Opens its First Concentrating Solar Power Plant in California is another story from EERE.
I wrote about Ausra here last March.
I said then “Ausra’s website has some terrific graphics, well worth seeing, and some fun speculation: “Solar Thermal Power Could Supply Over 90 percent of U.S. Grid Plus Auto Fleet.’” Talk about bullish on CSP!
“Flexible” Carbon-To-Liquid Fuel Process - According to researchers at Purdue University, we could be producing “alternative fuels, hydrogen and electricity from municipal solid wastes, agricultural wastes, forest residues and sewage sludge that could supply up to 20 percent of transportation fuels in the United States annually.” See this from “CarbonFree” and this from Purdue.
These sorts of pyrolysis or gasification plants have extraordinary potential.
(I envisioned them once in the context of a comprehensive proposal for New York City’s modest 25,000 tons a day of municipal solid waste and called the plan, Urban Gold .
The heart of the strategy is to co-locate a materials recovery facility [MRF] and other waste disposal facilities, such as pyrolysis or gasification plants, with industries that would use the recycled materials as feedstock for their manufacturing.
)
As I think I may have said before, without China, folks, getting a handle on global warming ain’t going nowhere.
Seems to me like they’re very much in the game.
Check out the article for more good news.
There's a lot of info in your piece!
Climate change is only one of the many issues of concern awaiting the next American president.
With the earth's temperature increasing and with pressure mounting for the creation and use of more viable energy sources, there is much to be done.
Yesterday, we published a quick guide entitled "Seven Things You Need to Know About Climate Change.
" Please check it out at http://publicagenda.org/blogs/voters-survival-kit-seven-things-you-need-know-about-climate-change .
As part of our Voter's Survival Kit we also produced an excellent non-partisan guide on climate change at http://publicagenda.org/citizen/electionguides/climatechange .
Again, excellent piece!
Change is what the Obama campaign was advertising.
They won and I, for my part, am not complaining about false advertising.
I’ve been raving here (and here , and here , among other places) about how the new administration is really rolling up its sleeves and getting down to cases on climate change, renewables, the green economy, etc.
So is the new Congress, as I’ve also duly noted a fair number of times, including in the last two posts below.
Friday’s “NY Times” had an article summarizing some of the salient differences between the Bush and Obama administrations on key environmental issues.
On climate change, the article says that Bush promoted “…a series of mainly voluntary climate and energy initiatives intended to slow the release of such gases, with no commitment to binding reductions at home or abroad.
“Mr.
Obama has taken precisely the opposite track.
He spoke late last month of the specter of ‘violent conflict, terrible storms, shrinking coastlines’ and other perils from unchecked warming, while pressing his vision of prosperity rebuilt around clean cars and pollution-free power from the wind and sun.”
In another somewhat stunning indication of the change of direction, the “LA Times” reports that U.S. financing groups pledge change on climate policies .
In 2002, Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and four cities in the Western US brought suit against the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corp. because they’d financed projects abroad that exacerbated global warming and thereby harmed the cities that joined the suit.
The plaintiffs argued that the federal aid agencies had not subjected the projects to environmental review as they should have under the National Environmental Policy Act , the foundation of American environmental law.
After seven years, the agencies and the plaintiffs settled the suit.
According to this release from Friends of the Earth, “…the Export-Import Bank will begin taking carbon dioxide emissions into account in evaluating fossil fuel projects and create an organization-wide carbon policy.
The Overseas Private Investment Corporation will establish a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with projects by 20 percent over the next ten years.
Both agencies will commit to increasing financing for renewable energy.” For much more on the lawsuit, see this .
Here’s another significant example of Obama and Co. switching things up: EPA drops appeal over utility mercury ruling .
The Bush EPA had contested “…a ruling by a U.S. appeals court that the EPA violated the Clean Air Act in 2005 when it exempted coal plants from the strictest emission controls for mercury and other toxic substances like arsenic, lead and nickel.” The utility industry is keeping their appeal active and the Supreme Court will consider it on February 20.
According to this Reuters story, “The nation’s 1,100 coal-burning units emit about 48 tons of mercury each year, the largest unregulated U.S. source.”
Mercury?
So what?
See this report from the consortium of Northeast US states fighting air pollution.
Do you eat fish?
You probably know then about the dangers of mercury.
If not, see this report from NRDC.”
Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chair Barbara Boxer had a press conference earlier this week, as I noted under Keeping Up the Pace in the post just below.
I watched some of it today on C-Span while I was having lunch.
In the press conference, Boxer, along with Democratic colleagues from the committee, outlined what the principles are going to be for climate change legislation.
Finally, Boxer was asked about Cap-and-Trade vs. Carbon Tax and said, unequivocally, it's going to be cap-and-trade.
Why? Because Europe and others are already doing it, the Western States and the Northeast are doing it, Obama has said that's the way to proceed, and she wants legislation to be consonant with what the rest of the world is doing.
She further noted the successes that cap-and-trade produced on acid rain here in the US.
One of the progenitors of the "cap-and-trade" system that allows polluters to accumulate "credits" is Environmental Defense, back when they were the Environmental Defense Fund.
The system was conceived with sulfur dioxide in mind.
Acid rain is largely a consequence of sulfur dioxide emissions from electrical and industrial power plants.
The push for this system to be deployed within the acid rain title of the Clean Air Act reauthorization was led by EDF.
See " The Cap and Trade Success Story " from Environmental Defense.
Very interestingly to me, at yesterday's symposium, Peter Koster, CEO of the European Climate Exchange , said that after Kyoto when the Europeans were looking for compliance mechanisms, they were urged by Clinton and Gore to adopt a "cap-and-trade" system because of the success of the acid rain program in the U.S.
Keeping Up the Pace - I’ve noted here that the new Obama administration is getting out of the starting blocks fast on climate change and energy.
(See Hitting the Ground Running and Hitting the Ground Running - Part Deux .
) Now Barbara Boxer, chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, has announced that her committee is going to be moving quickly to create a cap-and-trade system.
See this from the “Washington Post” today and this from “The Hill.” The latter reports on Boxer’s statement of principles:
Reduce emissions to levels guided by science to avoid dangerous global warming;
The other key Congressional entity for climate change legislation is the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
The new chair, Henry Waxman , announced his intention a few weeks ago to move “quickly and decisively.” See Waxman promises quick action on climate change from the AP via “USA Today.” Waxman held hearings last month and took testimony from a number of the nation’s leading environmentalists and business leaders, all members of the US Climate Action Partnership .
USCAP has called on Washington ” to quickly enact strong national legislation to require significant reductions of greenhouse gas emissions.”
The Regulatory Track - It’s really up to the Congress and the President to come together on a portfolio of energy and climate laws that will change the trajectory toward catastrophe that we’re on now.
But there are also measures that the new administration can take administratively.
For one thing, as you already know, the EPA can allow states like California to pursue aggressive action.
(See this from the blog last week.
)
A recent editorial from the “NY Times” suggest that the Obama administration take The Next Step on Warming .
“The logical next step would be for Mr. Obama to quickly address the Supreme Court’s 2007 decision ordering the Environmental Protection Agency to examine the effects of greenhouse gases and to regulate them if necessary.” (See this on that critical decision from April 2007.
) For her part, new EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson is unequivocal.
In a recent memo to EPA employees, she said: “EPA will stand ready to help Congress craft strong, science-based climate legislation that fulfills the vision of the President.
As Congress does its work, we will move ahead to comply with the Supreme Court’s decision recognizing EPA’s obligation to address climate change under the Clean Air Act.” You go, girl!
Efficiency - We have looked at the marvels of energy efficiency a number of times, most recently here under Less is More.
Take a look at these letters to the editor in response to another recent “NYT” editorial.
Bottom line, as Tom Casten ( super genius ) notes: “Policies to induce the capture of wasted energy could profitably cut carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent and greatly enhance manufacturing competitiveness.”
My dictionary defines vector as “an organism (as an insect) that transmits a pathogen.”
Researchers from Australia and the University of Wisconsin-Madison (my alma mater) have been looking at the species of mosquito that carries dengue fever.
Their studies indicate that climate change, on its present track, will increase mosquito habitat across much of Australia, thus endangering many more millions of people than are now threatened.
This, obviously, has implications for the whole world, not just Australia.
See this map from the CDC.
The World Health Organization is acutely aware of the mounting dangers involved.
Their webpage devoted to climate change reflects a lot of research and fieldwork that’s being done to minimize the health impacts, including using climate to predict infectious disease epidemics .
We’ve been reading Betsy Kolbert’s magisterial Field Notes from a Catastrophe in my class and I am reminded of the chapter, “The Butterfly and the Toad” about the changes in range and timing of many species, the potential for extinctions and the massive attenuation of ecosystem services .
One of Kolbert’s subjects is a biologist at the University of York, Chris Thomas.
He is involved in important new research that’s just been released on the global impact of climate change on biodiversity .
Moths in Borneo, first studied in 1965, have been since shown to have “moved uphill by about 67 metres over the intervening years to cope with changes in climate.” As Thomas explains: “As these species get pushed uphill towards cooler conditions, the amount of land that is available to them gets smaller and smaller.
And because most of the top of the mountain is bare rock, they may not be able to find suitable habitats, even if the temperature is right.
Some of the species are likely to die out.”
Climate change might also have some benefits in this context.
One new study details the potential for the retreat of some invasive plant species in the western United States.
One of the researchers is Michael Oppenheimer, the co-curator of the climate change exhibit at the American Museum of Natural History and a leading scientist and activist on climate change for many years.
This article from Seedquest, who provide “global information services for seed professionals,” quote the authors: “Just as native species are expected to shift in range and relative competitiveness with climate change, the same should be expected of invasive species.” This provides an opportunity for the restoration of native species that have been crowded out over time by the invasives.
The 27-nation European Union has come up with its proposals for how to proceed after the Kyoto Protocol expires in 2012.
As you know, the world is going to sit down in Copenhagen in December and finalize an agreement.
(See Further Thoughts on Poznan here from December.
)
You should further note that there’s a G20 summit scheduled for London for April 2 and climate change is going to be high on the agenda.
Also, according to the FT , the UNSG wants “… to convene a meeting of 30 to 40 heads of state in February or March to draw up a new framework for tackling the issue.” (Got all those acronyms?
You can’t do IR without the acronyms.
)
Obama takes steps to reverse Bush climate policies is the headline from Reuters.
For one thing, the new President has instructed the EPA to revisit California’s application to institute carbon dioxide limits on motor vehicles sold there.
(See California Standards here .
) See also this from the “Washington Post” today, including the video of Obama’s announcement in which he said, among other things, “The days of Washington dragging its heels are over.”
The “WaPo” also reported that “Separately, the State Department is expected to name Todd Stern , formerly a senior official in the Clinton administration, as the new U.S. envoy on climate change.
Here is the introduction by Sec.
of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and remarks from Stern - text and video .
New International Agency - AFP (via Yahoo) had this to say the other day: Germany hails creation of global climate-change agency .
More than 100 countries are to be represented in Bonn next week for the founding conference of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).
I mentioned the political interference with climate science here last year and toward the end of this post nearly two years ago.
The venerable Union of Concerned Scientists have had quite a lot of important things to say over the years about Scientific Integrity as well.
In any event, here is the new Energy Secretary, Nobel laureate Steven Chu, responding to questions posed during the transition from the public.
He’s, as I noted in yesterday’s post, one of a group of focused, smart, committed, progressive folks that Obama is bringing to bear on the critical issues of energy, the environment and climate change.
An article in this week’s edition of “EERE Network News” from DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, talks about President Obama’s inaugural address and its reference to renewables: how the US will “harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories.” It also notes that the address confronted climate change by saying “with old friends and former foes, we will work tirelessly to … roll back the specter of a warming planet.”
The new Secretary of the Interior, Ken Salazar, has said “I will be a strong and forceful advocate for the wise stewardship of our nation’s land and water resources, I will help us build a clean energy economy for the twenty-first century ” (See the release .
)
For more on the focused, smart, committed, progressive group that Obama has assembled on energy, the environment and climate change, see Obama’s Team and Obama’s Team, Continued .
Soot - When Rajendra Pachauri addressed the Asia Society (see last post below), he had a little video from TERI on its “ Lighting a Billion Lives ” project.
This aims to employ solar PV to power lanterns all over rural India.
What I would have liked to ask him was how TERI and others are addressing the cooking smoke that causes such extraordinary damage to health throughout the developing world and, very much not incidentally, exacerbates global warming.
See Black Carbon and Solar Cookers .
An article the other day from “The Independent” highlighted new research on the importance of reducing particulate pollution.
A study by NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies “shows that cutting down on the pollutant, which has so far been largely ignored by climate scientists, can have an immediate cooling effect , and prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths from air pollution at the same time.”
“The Independent” has great coverage on climate change.
For many more stories, go here .
“Lawful Excuse” - Here’s a story I missed from September, also reported in “The Independent.” Owing to a wonderful quirk of British law, activists from Greenpeace, who caused more than £35,000 worth of damage to a coal-fired power station, successfully argued that ” they had acted lawfully, owing to an honestly held belief that their attempt to stop emissions … would prevent further damage to properties worldwide caused by global warming.”
Climate Law - Speaking of the law, here’s another positive development: Center For Climate Change Law Launched At Columbia reads the release from Columbia Law School.
Mike Gerrard, one of the premier environmental lawyers and environmental law thinkers in the country, is heading up this new effort.
As we move ahead with a federal cap-and-trade regime, and get closer to a comprehensive international agreement, climate law is going to be center stage.
Columbia University is well placed to help develop the law and the lawyers to execute it.
Essay Competition - As my FPA colleague, Cassandra Clifford reported the other day at her excellent blog on Children, the World Bank has a competition for students on the essay subject: “How Does Climate Change Affect You?” Go here for more.
Crops that Fight Warming - Here’s an item from Reuters that jumped off the screen at me: Sun-reflecting crops could ease global warming .
One of the researchers is quoted as saying “We found that different varieties of most food crops do differ in how much solar energy is reflected back to space.” This is a promising approach for a number of reasons, including the relatively low cost of switching over to crops with higher reflective properties and the possibility that farmers could receive carbon credits.
I issued the “FPA Climate Change Challenge” over a year and a half ago here .
I wrote “Who’s got a good idea?
Okay, I’ll start this off.
Are you ready?
Since light color reflects heat efficiently ( albedo effect ), then why don’t we start breeding white grass and get people to accept this for their lawns and golf courses?
We should also use these on roofs.” Now I know I’m not daft.
The Asia Society held an interesting event the other day on the ins and outs of the melting of the Himalayan glaciers.
Dr. Rajendra Pachauri, the Chairman of the IPCC, was the keynote speaker.
Dr. Pachauri highlighted this startling observation: There were 500,000 square kilometers of glacial cover in the Himalayas in 1995.
At the present rate of shrinking, there will be 100,000 by 2030.
Got that?!
These glaciers are shrinking at a faster rate than any other in the world.
The permafrost is also thawing rapidly.
(For more on glaciers, see the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report for their “ Observations: Changes in Snow, Ice and Frozen Ground ” and also this slide show from UNEP.
)
Why should we care about this?
For one thing, the glaciers serve as the water source for 500 million people in South Asia and 250 million people in China.
For another thing, there are six million Tibetans whose home is being radically degraded by the thawing.
The symposium spent a good deal of the first part of the day addressing the problems for Tibetans.
The Asia Society’s “China Green” project has much more on the impact for Tibetans here , including stunning graphics on the diminution of the glaciers.
Another organization, chinadialogue, started by the journalist Isabel Hilton to increase the profile of environmental concerns in and about China, very much including climate change, has a section on the planet’s Third Pole — the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau.
Hilton was the moderator for much of the day’s discussions.
One speaker, an Australian scientist working in Tibet, pointed out that the per capita water supply for Asians is already very low.
There are, of course, extraordinary dangers to ecosystems inherent in the melting of the glaciers, both on the Tibetan plateau and all the way downstream to the river deltas that are fed by the Himalayas.
She has done a fair bit of work on the human security implications of this.
One other point which is further bad news for the Tibetans: The melting is allowing greater access to minerals - iron, gold, uranium and more - for the Chinese.
Saleemul Huq, from the Climate Change Group of the International Institute for Environment and Development and the Executive Director of Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies , had some important reminders, including the not-unimportant point that we are already very much in climate change.
As he said, in the long term, certainly, there is much to be done, but in the short term, we’re going to keep getting warmer and we’re going to continue to experience some dramatic and often-devastating impacts.
Much of Dr. Huq’s work is devoted to adaptation strategies.
Much of the work of Dr. Lara Hansen is also devoted to adaptation.
Formerly the chief scientist for WWF’s climate change program , she has recently founded EcoAdapt to, among other things, “help develop the field of climate change adaptation.” One of her main points was that any thinking, planning, or action that doesn’t, from this point on, take climate change into account, is going to be maladaptive.
We need to factor climate change into all of our social and political decisions.
We need to have a temporal perspective as well as spatial.
As to the “How Much is Too Much” debate, she comes down on the side of 280 parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , the level of the preindustrial air.
(We’re at 385 ppm now.
The IPCC says 450 ppm is a good target if we want to avoid serious devastation.
Bill McKibben, who spoke last week to the Asia Society on climate change, is the founder of 350.org .
) I’m with Dr. Hansen.
I must say that I am delighted that an organization with as much juice as the Asia Society is as concerned about climate change as it is.
I hope their concern and influence grows.
However, I was a little surprised by how relatively uninformed and pessimistic their blockbuster panel of Asia experts was about the state of American climate change politics, not to mention their view of the media and the business community.
The panel included Orville Schell from the Asia Society, Elizabeth Economy from the Council of Foreign Relations, Robert Barnett, head of the Columbia University Modern Tibetan Studies program, and Isabel Hilton.
They didn’t seem to particularly grok that Barack Obama has been talking about climate change in the strongest possible terms and his top-level appointees reflect his gung ho attitude.
They didn’t seem to get that the new Congress is poised to work hand-in-glove with Obama and Co. to advance serious renewable energy, energy efficiency, green economy, and cap-and-trade legislation.
(See Obama, The New Congress, and the International Climate Change Negotiations , for instance, and Obama’s Team and New House “Energy and Environment” Subcommittee .
I’ve also written numerous times here about the extraordinary wealth of coverage that the media, MSM and otherwise, has given climate change, and the tremendous awareness and growing concern that business has for the subject.
)
I’m a big fan of Christopher Patten.
I read his East and West: China, Power and the Future of Asia when it came out in 1999.
He, along with people like John Ikenberry, thinks that China needs to be part of the liberal international order.
I think that the US (finally) and Europe will lead on climate change and that China and the rest of the world will come along.
Let me leave you with this from Patten:
Obama and Congress - Why don’t I think we’re going to fall into a serious renewable energy trough?
Because the next President and the new Congress are on it.
Stimulus Bill May Include Energy Measures reports the “Washington Post.” In October, the Congress crafted an extension and expansion of tax credits, long overdue, for renewables.
(See Tax Credits!
) Now, according to the WaPo, “Congressional leaders and Obama advisers are looking at including as much as $25 billion of energy tax credits in the economic stimulus package in an effort to bolster renewable energy projects “ (There are incentives for ethanol too - but you can’t have perfect public policy all the time.
[You probably can, but not in this universe.
] See Are Biofuels A Bummer?
, among other posts, and stay tuned for a look at a new report on how dismally this particular approach rates environmentally.
) See also this from Dow Jones.
Vaclav Klaus - The Czech President had an op-ed this past week in the “Financial Times” that grabbed some attention, more so because the Czech Republic has just assumed the rotating presidency of the European Union.
I have written recently about the extraordinary leadership of the EU on energy and climate, for instance here and here , including the assiduity in all of this by French President Nicolas Sarkozy who led the EU for the final half of last year.
With Klaus, a well-known Skeptic at the helm of the EU, people are holding their breath.
(I mentioned Klaus and how his shenanigans embarrass many Czechs at the end of this post from a while back.
)
Klaus wrote at the “FT” that “The uniqueness of current levels of global warming is not a proven phenomenon.
The explanation of factors that are contributing to global warming is not very clear and persuasive.
Moves to mitigate climate change by fighting carbon dioxide emissions are useless and, what is most important, human beings have proved themselves to be sufficiently adaptable to an incrementally changing climate.” Phew!
This is one of the prices we pay for democracy.
You sometimes get folks who are, in a word, deranged, holding high public office.
(See also Bush, Cheney, Inhofe and some others.
)
Suffice it to say that Klaus got some pushback.
Here’s one eloquent letter saying, among other things, “his conclusions that climate change “alarmists’ are responsible for “restraining our freedom’ is downright otherworldly.” Another letter says Klaus “must be living in a parallel universe, when he declares: “The global climate is basically not changing.’ He might just as well insist that the world is flat.” The writer further quotes Daniel Cohn-Bendit, co-president of the Greens/European Free Alliance Group in the European parliament who recently told Klaus: “I don’t care about your opinions.” Ouch.
Food Shortages - I was struck by this headline from UPI: Global warming could overheat crops .
A study, published in “Science,” posits that “Rapidly warming climate is likely to seriously alter crop yields in the tropics and subtropics by the end of this century and, without adaptation, leave half of the world’s population facing serious food shortages” Here’s the release from Stanford University’s Program on Food Security and the Environment (FSE).
One of the coauthors of the study is the director of FSE, the other is a professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Washington.
Plus, “The serious climate issues won’t be limited to the tropics, the authors conclude.
As an example, they cite record temperatures that struck Western Europe in June, July and August of 2003, killing an estimated 52,000 people.
That summer-long heat wave cut wheat yields and fodder production in France and Italy by one-third.”
Very significantly, the Subcommittees on Energy and Air Quality and Environment and Hazardous Materials have been combined into one: Energy and Environment .
(The old Health and Environment Subcommittee was chaired by Waxman from 1979 to 1994, so he really knows this area.
I’ve been a fan of Waxman’s for years, owing to his superb performances on clean air legislation way back when.
)
The chairman of Energy and Air Quality, Rick Boucher, has been replaced by climate activist Ed Markey as chair of Energy and Environment.
This is further evidence of the seriousness of Nancy Pelosi and the rest of the leadership in their focus on energy and climate change.
Markey was appointed to chair a special Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming in the last Congress and will continue in that role, although the new Subcommittee is going to be where a lot of rubber is going to meet the road.
Boucher was closely allied with the deposed chairman, John Dingell, and was felt to not be at all on the same wavelength as Waxman and the leadership.
See this from this “Boston Globe” as well.
I think the comments from the president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, as Howard Cosell might say, tell it like it is: “”In the last Congress, the two people who were in charge of writing global warming legislation in the House of Representatives .
. .
were big auto and big coal,’ said Kevin Knobloch, president of the Cambridge-based Union of Concerned Scientists, referring to Dingell’s and Boucher’s support for their local auto and coal industries.
Markey’s ascension “is part of an exciting, game-changing leadership in the Congress on climate and energy,’ Knobloch said.” See more from the Gristmill.
Coal Ash - I wrote last week about the horrific spill of coal ash sludge in Tennessee.
(See Jan. 1 below.
) Hundreds of Coal Ash Dumps Lack Regulation is the story today from the “NY Times.” There are more than 1,300 of them, “most of them unregulated and unmonitored.” What do they contain?
“heavy metals like arsenic, lead, mercury and selenium, which are considered by the Environmental Protection Agency to be a threat to water supplies and human health.” The article link has an excellent video too, well worth viewing.
One of the themes of the superb documentary Burning the Future: Coal in America is the poisoning of drinking water.
(I wrote about this film and what it depicts at The Crime of Mountaintop Removal Mining last May.
) The “NY Times” article included this compelling graphic on the extent of water pollution from these sites.
Oil Sands - Today’s “NYT” also has an article about Canadian tar sands, their abundance - and their devastating environmental impact - The Costly Compromises of Oil From Sand .
In a post from March last year, I wrote about oil sands, and flagged a potential big fly in the ointment for the “flow” of oil to the US: our energy law passed in December of 2007 limits government procurement of alternative fuels that have lifecycle GHG emissions greater than conventional ones.
The article here reports: “In a recent study, the RAND Corporation estimated that oil from the oil sands generates about 10 to 30 percent more greenhouse gases than conventional crude.” Does this make any sense when we’re trying to get to a low-carbon world?
Not to me.
To you?
(See also this characteristically terrific story from Betsy Kolbert at the “New Yorker” - Unconventional Crude .
)
Overall, the “NY Times” has consistently superb coverage.
See their Global Warming topics page for “all the news that’s fit to print.”
Included here is The curse of carbon , an article that looks at sea ice melting, ocean acidification and the threat to coral reefs, among other things.
(If you want to know more about the ocean and climate change's impact, you couldn't do better than to continue with Betsy Kolbert's article in "The New Yorker" from two years ago, The Darkening Sea .
You can also see the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change material on the ocean from its Fourth Assessment Report.

At the FT today, there's a great overview of the relationship between the incoming Obama administration's views on climate change and the international talks.
(From December 2 through 21 here, I covered the Obama team, some of the salient points about Congress, the EU talks and the UN-sponsored talks in Poland.
) "As night from day' is the difference that John Kerry identified between the approaches of the Bush and Obama administration.
Let's hope so.
As UNSG Ban Ki-moon said in Poland: "Yes, the economic crisis is serious.
Yet when it comes to climate change, the stakes are even higher.
The climate crisis affects our potential prosperity and our peoples' lives, both now and far into the future.
"
Now to some serious business, I’m afraid.
We here at the blog and the entire large (and growing) community fighting global warming are well aware of the role of fossil fuel combustion in the production of greenhouse gases.
Coal is, of course, the greatest culprit in the production of carbon dioxide.
The magisterial Big Coal by Jeff Goodell has three parts that describe the depredations of coal: The Dig, The Burn, The Heat.
What we so often forget, in our focus on the threat of catastrophic climate change, are the dire effects of coal mining , the Dig , for the communities where the mines are situated.
On December 22, as you no doubt are well aware by now, a dam broke at a Tennessee Valley Authority coal-fired power plant and released “more than 1 billion gallons of coal ash sludge” according to “The Tennessean” here .
That article and this , from the “NY Times,” have a lot to report on the toxicity of the sludge.
For a little more of the bigger picture on coal ash, see (and hear) Tennessee Spill: The Exxon Valdez Of Coal Ash?
from NPR.
“Coal ash is the stuff that’s left over after coal-fired power plants generate electricity and strip out pollutants.
Plants produce about 130 million tons of it every year.”
What pollutants don’t get stripped out?
Mercury is one critical one.
See this report from the consortium of Northeast US states fighting air pollution.
Do you eat fish?
You probably know then about the dangers of mercury.
If not, see this report from NRDC.
“Since the mid-1990s, coal companies have pulverized Appalachian mountaintops in West Virginia, Kentucky, Virginia and Tennessee.
Peaks formed hundreds of millions of years ago are obliterated in months.
Forests that survived the last ice age are chopped down and burned.
The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that by 2012, two decades of mountaintop removal will have destroyed or degraded 11.5 percent of the forests in those four states, an area larger than Delaware.
Rubble and waste will have buried more than 1,000 miles of streams.”
Obama’s Team, Continued - Climate experts get key US posts is the headline from the BBC.
John Holdren , a physicist, Harvard professor, and director of the Woods Hole Research Center, has been named Obama’s top science advisor.
Holdren is a passionate advocate of early and decisive action on warming.
See also this from Woods Hole on the announcement in which Holdren says: “None of the great interlinked challenges of our time - the economy, energy, environment, health, security, and the particular vulnerabilities of the poor to shortfalls in all of these - can be solved without insights and advances from the physical sciences, the life sciences, and engineering.”
Obama also named marine biologist Jane Lubchenco to head the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), an agency that has critical importance in how we monitor the environmental changes that are occurring.
She is a professor at Oregon State and another outspoken member of the scientific community on the issue of climate change.
See her webpage here .
(Coincidence that Michelle Obama’s brother is the basketball coach at Oregon State?
Probably.)
Further Thoughts on Poznan - There were several important developments at these UNFCCC meetings worth noting.
(See here and here for previous posts.
) The road to Copenhagen will yet be tortuous and stony, but, for one thing, the idea of intensified efforts on “reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation” ( REDD ) has taken hold.
We are not only diminishing the capacity of forests to sequester carbon in cutting them down, but burning them increases carbon dioxide.
(I’ve written about forests a number of times at the blog.
)
Another milestone occurred in the launch of the Adaptation Fund .
Bloomberg News put it this way here : “Poor countries at the United Nations climate talks in Poland may win approval to tap into a $990 million fund as early as next month to cope with the damage of global warming, their biggest victory in 11 days of debate.”
Another of the main developments was the firm commitment to an arduous work plan for the coming year.
See this summary from the Pew Center on Global Climate Change and the comprehensive coverage from the UNFCCC, which includes webcasts, and all the documentation.
Finally, listen to Yvo de Boer, UNFCCC executive secretary, at his final media briefing .
In a related story, from RenewableEnergyWorld.com , titled Report Details Potential of Combined Heat and Power in US , we learn that if the US had 20% of generating capacity coming from CHP by 2030, we would realize a 60% reduction of the projected increase in carbon dioxide emissions.
I heard an energy consultant once say that not having CHP as a standard should be construed as criminal behavior.
You can see why.
Renewables Beat the Old Energy - In another item from the always excellent RenewableEnergyWorld.com , we get that a study from Stanford gives quantitative reasons why nuclear, coal and biofuels are very much the wrong path if we want “to improve energy security, mitigate global warming and reduce the number of deaths caused by air pollution” You can read this important paper here , at “Energy & Environmental Science.” (See also my reference to a terrific article, “Exajoules of Hope,” at a post from August.
)
As of today, we now have the last of the top energy and environment players in place.
President-Elect Obama has named former Iowa Gov.
Tom Vilsack to be Secretary of Agriculture and Colorado Sen. Ken Salazar to Interior.
See this , including a video of the announcement, from the WaPo.
Obama said “How we harness our natural resources, from the farmlands of Iowa to the springs of Colorado, will speak not only to our quality of life, but to our economic growth and our energy future.” Salazar said he was looking forward to taking “the moon-shot on energy independence” and also to confronting “the dangers of global warming.” Vilsack said that Ag would help provide “American leadership on climate change.” Both nominees are unequivocal on climate change.
Carol Browner , Clinton and Gore’s EPA Administrator, will coordinate many of the activities of these agencies from the White House.
She has been named Coordinator for Energy and Climate.
One would like to think she will have nearly equal status with Gen. Jones, the new National Security Advisor, and Larry Summers, the head of Obama’s National Economic Council.
Climate change is certainly a security issue on any number of fronts and an economic issue - as we’ve long since come to realize.
There is no greater issue on the foreign policy front these days, either, including trade, terrorism, or development.
In fact, it impacts on all three.
In any event, there’s a ton of work to do for all these agencies and their new leadership.
See, for instance, Hard Task for New Team on Energy and Climate from the NYT yesterday.
Part of the task is going to be helping to move legislation through Congress and getting a good handle on the negotiations leading to Copenhagen next year.
The good news is that nearly everybody in leadership positions from the President to his top officials to Senate and House leaders and their committee chairs all seem to be in accord , on the urgency of climate change, the need to transition to a low-carbon world, and to boost the economy by making it more energy efficient across the board and by weaning us from the dire environmental problems caused or exacerbated by fossil fuel use.
Steven Chu is particularly interesting in this regard.
He appears to be genuinely passionate about moving to a low-carbon society and acutely aware of the dangers of global warming.
See excerpts from an NPR interview from last year and this from Joe Romm at The Gristmill.
Romm cites a recent WSJ blog item that references a rather salient quote from Chu: “Coal is my worst nightmare.” See also this important speech before the Copenhagen Climate Council last year in which Chu refers to climate change as a “clear and present danger.”
It’s fair to say that Obama has assembled a team highly capable of getting the job done on climate change and energy - and with the motivation to make it happen.
That’s the title of Paul Krugman’s column today at the “NYT.” As I’ve been saying here, that sure seems to be the gestalt of the Obama administration and the new Congress when it comes to energy, the environment and climate change.
Krugman says here, among other things, “…it’s also heartening to see that the budget projects $645 billion in revenues from the sale of emission allowances.
After years of denial and delay by its predecessor, the Obama administration is signaling that it’s ready to take on climate change.”
So what else does the budget tell us?
Along with the economic stimulus package and the tax credits from the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, there’s all sorts of love for renewables, energy efficiency, the smart grid, mass transportation and other sane and sound public policy initiatives.
Krugman’s colleague, John Broder, has this breakdown on the “green” aspects of the budget.
As Krugman notes, there’s ample revenue from cap-and-trade.
What’s more: “Under the plan, 100 percent of pollution permits will be auctioned, meaning no sector of the economy will be exempted from paying for the right to emit carbon dioxide and other gases that contribute to global warming.
This is consistent with Mr. Obama’s campaign pledge, and it is a matter of fierce debate.” You can say that twice!
Reuters’s headline is Obama budget realistic on climate revenue: analysts .
“The $646 billion figure, spread over eight years, presumes that a U.S. law to limit carbon emissions will be in place by 2012, and Obama has said he will work with Congress to make this happen.” Barbara Boxer has said she wants a bill out this year.
Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi are singing from the same hymnal.
See more on the political status of cap-and-trade here from Bloomberg.
Begin A Comprehensive Approach To Transform Our Energy Supply And Slow Global Warming
What’s not to love?
One possible problem: various localities may not be ready for this cornucopia.
See Preparing for a Flood of Energy Efficiency Spending , again from the “NYT.” (Hey, I read a lot of different publications and websites and, frankly, the “NYT” is on it.
The Grey Lady has got some excellent reporting on many of the myriad ins and outs of energy, the environment and climate change.
)
Capitol Climate Action is organizing a “mass civil disobedience” at the old coal-fired Capitol power plant.
Perhaps it needn’t be said, but I’ll mention it anway: This is meant to be 100% nonviolent civil disobedience, in the tradition of Gandhi and Dr. King.
I will be teaching on climate change on Monday in New York, but I will definitely be with the protesters in spirit.
I say with some pride that I was in jail for three days for CD at the Pentagon in 1972 along with Father Groppi , the veteran Civil Rights activist; David Dellinger , one of the fathers of American civil disobedience; and a hundred or so others.
See this open letter from Martin Sheen, Paul Hawken, Jim Hansen and some other prominent environmentalists that appeared in the Huff-Po.
Their call to arms: “It is time to seize the opportunity to be a country where actions speak louder than words–we can and we must!” Here’s a video from Jim Hansen , one of the world’s pre-eminent climate scientists and environmental protection visionaries.
The article references the wildly successful “Pollution Prevention Pays” program that 3M pioneered over 30 years ago.
(See also under National Association of Manufacturers here .

(See What’s the Color of Your Supply Chain?
) All in all, this FT article is brilliant, articulating what is not only the necessary path for companies, but the right thing to do.
Oil Industry Ready to Work on Global Warming is one of the reports coming out of this conference.
The “NY Times” says that the top execs at the oil companies who spoke down in Houston differed on Cap-and-Trade vs. Carbon Tax but that they saw the handwriting on the wall for a price on carbon, however it’s going to be configured.
“Almost all of them seemed reconciled to the United States’ adopting some kind of climate policy, and said they were eager to work with the new administration to devise an effective energy strategy.”
It is the mission of the Foreign Policy Association to engage and educate the public on international issues.
This blog has tried to play its part by disseminating information on the science, politics, policy and business of energy, the environment and climate change.
Hopefully, it has stimulated some thinking and, ideally, some action.
But the Foreign Policy Association and this blog don’t, at the end of the day, have the influence of the Secretary of Energy of the United States of America.
When Nobel Laureate Steven Chu says “The world needs a ‘revolution’ in science and technology to solve global warming,” many people are going to hear that.
“Scientific American” is reporting here on a recent interview in the “NY Times.”
I’ve written here over the past few months - and I continue to believe, based on the growing body of evidence - that there is a high level of commitment, competence and forthrightness from Obama and his top people on energy, the environment and climate change.
This is true as well for key members of the House and Senate, and staff.
They, along with members of the environmental community, key players in business and the academy, and other policymakers here and throughout the world, are all working very hard to bring us out of the dark ages of wasteful and destructive energy use and environmental degradation.
It bodes well.
I’ve been blogging on climate change for almost two years here - and having a great time, don’t get me wrong.
But there are some new FPA sister blogs that are looking at this issue as well.
Welcome aboard.
Check out, for instance, Thawing Permafrost Could Accelerate Global Warming from Mia Bennett at the blog on The Arctic.
See also this long, thoughtful post, Climate Change - A Global Issue, A Global Solution , from David Kampf at the Rising Powers blog.

The panelists all seemed to agree that Canada needs a coherent and comprehensive energy policy, including how they intend to deal with climate change.
President Obama is making his first foreign trip next week to meet with Canadian PM Stephen Harper.
Energy and the environment will be at the top of the agenda.
But here’s the blockbuster, announced today: the largest solar deal ever , according to MarketWatch.
Southern California Edison will buy 1,300 megawatts of solar thermal power from BrightSource Energy , a start-up with backing from some heavy hitters that include Google and BP.
SCE says this is enough power to serve 845,000 homes and avoid more than two million tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually.
‘Tis a consummation devoutly to be wished.
See the BrightSource technology page here to see their short video and to learn more about how their approach works.
Among the several tacks that Obama and Co. are taking on climate change, one very critical one is in international relations.
The State Department has named its envoy on climate change, Todd Stern , and the Secretary of State is heading to Asia next week for extensive meetings in Japan, Indonesia, Korea and China.
Secretary Clinton “…will be discussing common approaches to the challenges facing the international community” very much including climate change.
All of those countries have a huge stake in the outcome of the negotiations in Copenhagen , none more so than China.
Geoffrey Lean at “The Independent” has just come out with a two-part analysis of the potential for quantum leaps in the US-China relationship.
See articles here and here .
It’s hyperbole, perhaps, but there are some high hopes expressed here: “Maybe we are on the brink of one of those rare moments that transform the world for the better.
For the Obama administration’s moves to forge a climate partnership with China offer much the best chance yet of averting the most serious crisis civilisation has faced.”
Meanwhile, Andy Revkin over at his “NY Times” blog “Dot Earth” zeroed in last week on Clinton’s trip and the importance of China in the scheme of things.
He says here that “The visit to China meshes with early signals sent recently by President Obama’s nascent energy and climate team about the importance of working with the industrializing giant on these entwined issues.”
Where’s China been and where are they going?
For some background, see this from me last summer.
When I wrote about an event I attended recently on The Melting Himalayas , I opined that “…the US (finally) and Europe will lead on climate change and that China and the rest of the world will come along.” It appears that the leadership of which I spoke is forthcoming from the Obama administration.
I continue to believe that China will do the right thing, given the proper international and bilateral frameworks.
Most ecosystems, under constant conditions, eventually approach a steady-state C stock that is dictated by management, climate, and soil properties.
But changes imposed on the ecosystem can alter the balance of C inputs and losses, shifting the ecosystem, eventually, to a new steady state (Paustian et al., 1997c).
For example, after conversion of forests or grasslands to arable agriculture, losses of C often exceed inputs temporarily, resulting in a net loss of C to the atmosphere until a new, lower equilibrium level is reached (Balesdent et al., 1998; Huggins et al., 1998; Solomon et al., 2000).
At least a portion of C lost, however, can often be recovered by adopting management practices that again favour higher C stocks (Cole et al., 1997).
The accumulation of C in soil can continue until a new steady state is reached, often after several or more decades.
Most of the additional C is stored in the soil as organic matter.
Apart from agroforests, agricultural lands store very little carbon in plant biomass ( Table 4.1 ).
Croplands, as referred to here, are lands devoted, at least periodically, to the production of arable crops (wetland rice, because of its unique features, is discussed separately).
Soil C in these lands can often be preserved or enhanced by using farming systems with reduced tillage intensity, thus slowing the rate at which soil organic matter decomposes (Bajracharya et al., 1997; Feller and Beare, 1997; Rasmussen and Albrecht, 1997; Dick et al., 1998).
Another way to promote higher soil C is to increase crop yields.
This can be done by applying organic amendments, by effective use of fertilizers, by using improved crop varieties, or by irrigating.
These practices help replenish soil organic matter by increasing the amount of crop residues returned to the soil (Raun et al., 1998; Huggins et al., 1998; Paustian et al., 1997b; Lal et al., 1998; Smith et al., 1997; Fernandes et al.
1997; Izac 1997).
Further, soil C can often be increased by using practices that extend the duration of C fixation by photosynthesis; for example, cover crops, perennial forages in rotation, and avoiding bare fallow tend to increase organic C returns to soil (Lal et al., 1997; Singh et al., 1997a; Smith et al., 1997; Carter et al.
1998; Tiessen et al., 1998; Tian et al., 1999; Paustian et al., 1997a, 2000).
Farming techniques that reduce erosion (e.g., terracing, windbreaks, and residue management) maintain productivity and also prevent loss of C from agricultural soils.
The net effect of soil erosion on atmospheric CO
Rice land, as the term is used here, refers to areas that are at least periodically flooded for wetland rice production.
Carbon stocks in these systems can be preserved or enhanced by the addition of organic amendments (Singh et al., 1997b; Kumar et al., 1999) and nutrient management (Yadav et al., 1998).
Rice lands, however, are an important source of methane and, from the standpoint of overall radiative forcing, management effects on methane emissions may be more important than effects on C storage (Greenland, 1995; Sampson et al., 2000).
Methane emissions can be suppressed to some extent by soil amendments, altered tillage practices, water management, crop rotation, and cultivar selection (Minami, 1995; Kern et al., 1997; Neue, 1997; Yagi et al., 1997; Van der Gon, 2000).
For more information on CH4 and N2O emissions from land use, see Section 3.6 .
Another form of land-use conversion is the rehabilitation of severely degraded lands.
Severely degraded lands are those where previous management has caused a drastic decline or disruption of productivity.
Large areas of degraded lands occur on lands previously used for agriculture; lands abandoned after excessive erosion, over-grazing, desertification, or salinization (Oldeman, 1994; Lal and Bruce, 1999).
Often the degradation was caused by social and economic pressures, and land rehabilitation may depend on the amelioration of the underlying causes of degradation.
Specific rehabilitation practices include: introduction of new species (e.g., reforestation), addition of nutrients, and organic amendments (e.g., Lal and Bruce, 1999; Lal et al., 1998; Izaurralde et al., 1997).
Various attempts have been made to estimate potential C storage by improved management of agricultural lands.
In the IPCC Second Assessment Report, Cole et al.
(1996) estimated the potential for C storage in agricultural soils from improved management of existing croplands, restoration of degraded lands, and conversion to grass or forestlands.
By assuming that one-half to two-thirds of the estimated historic C loss from cultivated soils could be recovered in 50 years, they proposed potential soil C increases of about 0.4 to 0.6GtC/yr from better management of existing agricultural soils.
According to their estimates, additional C could be stored by set-aside of surplus upland soils (0.015 to 0.03GtC/yr), restoration of wetlands (0.006 to 0.012GtC/yr), and restoration of degraded lands (0.024 to 0.24GtC/yr), yielding a combined potential of about 0.44 to 0.88GtC/yr over a 50-year period.
Later studies have provided similar estimates.
Lal and Bruce (1999), using rates of soil C gain from the literature, estimated global C storage potentials of 0.43 to 0.57GtC/yr in the next 20-50 years, from erosion control, soil restoration, conservation tillage and residue management, and improved cropping practices.
Batjes (1999), based partly on C gains estimated by Bruce et al.
(1999), proposed that an additional 14GtC (±7) could be stored in agricultural soils over the next 25 years by improved management of “degraded” and “stable” agricultural lands.
Including “extensive grasslands” and “regrowth forests” increased the estimate to 20GtC (±10), corresponding to an average rate of 0.58 to 0.80GtC/yr.
Increases in soil carbon content in response to improved practices cannot continue indefinitely.
Eventually, soil C storage will approach a new equilibrium where C gains equal C losses (Paustian et al., 2000).
This new equilibrium will depend on the management practices adopted, as well as on soil type and climatic conditions.
Consequently, rates of C gain will diminish with time, and estimates for a given year cannot be extrapolated far into the future.
Once soils reach a new equilibrium, there is little further accumulation of C. And if the C-conserving practice is discontinued (e.g., reversion from no-tillage to intensive tillage), much of the previously gained C may be lost back to the atmosphere as CO
The IPCC says “Post-consumer waste is a small contributor to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (<5%) with total emissions of approximately 1,300 Mt carbon dioxide-eq in 2005.
The largest source is landfill methane ” Still, that’s a lot of GHG.
(See the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report Working Group III Report “Mitigation of Climate Change” - Chapter 10: Waste management .
)
With solid waste management, as with any sector, there are ancillary benefits to reducing GHG: increased energy efficiency, fewer hazardous wastes for disposal, etc., etc.
The AR4-WG3 Glossary defines Co-benefits as “The benefits of policies implemented for various reasons at the same time, acknowledging that most policies designed to address greenhouse gas mitigation have other, often at least equally important, rationales (e.g., related to objectives of development, sustainability, and equity).”
Another way of looking at this is in having “no regrets” in your climate mitigation policy.
The IPCC glossary describes it this way: “No-regret policy (options/potential) - Such policy would generate net social benefits whether or not there is climate change associated with anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases.
No-regret options for GHG emissions reduction refer to options whose benefits (such as reduced energy costs and reduced emissions of local/regional pollutants) equal or exceed their costs to society, excluding the benefits of avoided climate change.”
I devised a plan a few years back for New York City’s municipal solid waste.
I articulated my ideas, gleaned from the best concepts and practices in urban sustainable development, in a comprehensive proposal for New York City’s modest 25,000 tons a day of municipal solid waste and called the plan, Urban Gold .
The heart of the strategy is to co-locate a materials recovery facility (MRF) and other waste disposal facilities, such as pyrolysis or gasification plants , with industries that would use the recycled materials as feedstock for their manufacturing.
Another way to feed a MRF is to use recovered materials from a landfill.
The idea of “landfill mining” has been kicking around for a number of years and has found some traction.
See this article from Reuters - Could US$100 Oil Turn Dumps Into Plastic Mines?
(See also this Reuters “factbox” on landfills.
The IPCC’s Waste Management piece cited above is also full of useful information.
)
All sorts of “best practices” are coming into greater prominence as a result of our having to confront the climate change crisis.
One should have little or no regret at all about this.

Each year power plants and chemical facilities create many tons of mercury pollution, which makes its way into our homes and bodies in fish.
Two of the biggest sources of mercury pollution are chlorine chemical plants and coal-fired power plants.
Chlorine plants, which use massive quantities of mercury to extract chlorine from salt, "lose" dozens of tons of mercury each year; power plants emit around 50 tons of mercury pollution annually.
Facilities that recycle auto scrap are another big source of mercury pollution, pouring 10 to 12 tons of mercury into the air every year.
The most common way Americans are exposed to mercury is through tuna fish.
Coal is naturally contaminated with mercury, and when it is burned to generate electricity, mercury is released into the air through the smokestacks.
The bulk of this mercury pollution could be eliminated with the installation of pollution-control devices.
Similar devices have proved very successful on municipal incinerators, which were once a significant source of mercury pollution.
But in January 2004 the Bush administration proposed to weaken and delay efforts to clean up mercury emissions from roughly 1,100 coal-fired boilers at more than 460 electric power plants.
Essentially, the administration's plan treats mercury as if it were a run-of-the-mill air pollutant instead of a hazardous air pollutant, allowing the Environmental Protection Agency to avoid requiring power plants to reduce emissions by the maximum amount technologically achievable.
Big mercury polluters also include older mercury chlorine plants, also called chlor-alkali plants.
These plants use mercury to convert salt to chlorine gas and caustic soda (better known as lye), which is used in soaps and detergents, in plastics, and in the paper-making process.
More modern chlor-alkali plants use a cleaner, mercury-free technology, but seven U.S. chlor-alkali plants continue to use mercury.
(Two of these have announced plans to shift to cleaner technologies.
)
At any given time, each of these plants has an average of 200 tons of mercury on site.
In virtually every year since records have been kept, chlor-alkali plants have "lost" dozens of tons of mercury in the manufacturing process.
These plants cannot account for where the lost mercury goes.
Nor can the Environmental Protection Agency, but the agency has failed to set restrictions on these emissions.
NRDC air quality tests have detected high levels of mercury in the vicinity of four chlor-alkali plants.
Mercury pollution also occurs when mercury-based light switches from automobiles are scrapped and melted down for recycling.
As the switches melt, the mercury they contain vaporizes into the air.
Following considerable public pressure, auto manufacturers stopped using mercury in January 2003.
But as long as older cars are incinerated, mercury pollution will continue to escape into the air.
To prevent this, mercury-based car switches should be removed at the scrap yard, before cars are shredded and sent to steel mills for recycling.
Removing the switches would take less than a minute per car, on average -- a cost that should be borne by the companies that installed them in the first place, not by the scrap industry.
Some states have passed or are moving toward legislation or regulations requiring the removal of mercury switches from automobile scrap.
But the EPA has yet to introduce standards that will curb switch-related mercury pollution nationwide.
More information on mercury in automobiles is available on the Clean Car Campaign's website .
Subsistence and sports fishermen who eat their catch can be at a particularly high risk of mercury poisoning if they fish regularly in contaminated waters.
Across the United States, mercury pollution is known to have contaminated 12 million acres of lakes, estuaries, and wetlands (30 percent of the total), and 473,000 miles of streams, rivers, and coasts.
And many waterways have not even been tested.
In 2003, 44 states issued fish consumption advisories, warning citizens to limit how often they eat certain types of fish caught in the state's waters because they are contaminated with mercury.
While mercury is a so-called persistent pollutant, meaning that it doesn't break down as some other pollutants do, its dangers lessen considerably over time, because it eventually settles into the beds of rivers, lakes and oceans and is covered over by successive layers of sediment.
At some point, fish stop consuming the mercury so eventually it ceases to be a hazard to humans.
We can begin safeguarding our health now by stopping mercury pollution at its sources.
My dictionary defines vector as “an organism (as an insect) that transmits a pathogen.”
Researchers from Australia and the University of Wisconsin-Madison (my alma mater) have been looking at the species of mosquito that carries dengue fever.
Their studies indicate that climate change, on its present track, will increase mosquito habitat across much of Australia, thus endangering many more millions of people than are now threatened.
This, obviously, has implications for the whole world, not just Australia.
See this map from the CDC.
The World Health Organization is acutely aware of the mounting dangers involved.
Their webpage devoted to climate change reflects a lot of research and fieldwork that’s being done to minimize the health impacts, including using climate to predict infectious disease epidemics .
We’ve been reading Betsy Kolbert’s magisterial Field Notes from a Catastrophe in my class and I am reminded of the chapter, “The Butterfly and the Toad” about the changes in range and timing of many species, the potential for extinctions and the massive attenuation of ecosystem services .
One of Kolbert’s subjects is a biologist at the University of York, Chris Thomas.
He is involved in important new research that’s just been released on the global impact of climate change on biodiversity .
Moths in Borneo, first studied in 1965, have been since shown to have “moved uphill by about 67 metres over the intervening years to cope with changes in climate.” As Thomas explains: “As these species get pushed uphill towards cooler conditions, the amount of land that is available to them gets smaller and smaller.
And because most of the top of the mountain is bare rock, they may not be able to find suitable habitats, even if the temperature is right.
Some of the species are likely to die out.”
Climate change might also have some benefits in this context.
One new study details the potential for the retreat of some invasive plant species in the western United States.
One of the researchers is Michael Oppenheimer, the co-curator of the climate change exhibit at the American Museum of Natural History and a leading scientist and activist on climate change for many years.
This article from Seedquest, who provide “global information services for seed professionals,” quote the authors: “Just as native species are expected to shift in range and relative competitiveness with climate change, the same should be expected of invasive species.” This provides an opportunity for the restoration of native species that have been crowded out over time by the invasives.

Natural ecosystems perform fundamental life-support services upon which human civilization depends.
Unless human activities are carefully planned and managed, valuable ecosystems will continue to be impaired or destroyed.
Ecosystem Services are the processes by which the environment produces resources that we often take for granted such as clean water, timber, and habitat for fisheries, and pollination of native and agricultural plants.
Whether we find ourselves in the city or a rural area, the ecosystems in which humans live provide goods and services that are very familiar to us.
An ecosystem is a community of animals and plants interacting with one another and with their physical environment.
Ecosystems include physical and chemical components, such as soils, water, and nutrients that support the organisms living within them.
These organisms may range from large animals and plants to microscopic bacteria.
Ecosystems include the interactions among all organisms in a given habitat.
People are part of ecosystems.
The health and wellbeing of human populations depends upon the services provided by ecosystems and their components — organisms, soil, water, and nutrients.
Natural ecosystems and the plants and animals within them provide humans with services that would be very difficult to duplicate.
While it is often impossible to place an accurate monetary amount on ecosystem services, we can calculate some of the financial values.
Many of these services are performed seemingly for “free,” yet are worth many trillions of dollars, for example:
Much of the Mississippi River Valley’s natural flood protection services were destroyed when adjacent wetlands were drained and channels altered.
As a result, the 1993 floods resulted in property damages estimated at twelve billion dollars partially from the inability of the Valley to lessen the impacts of the high volumes of water.
Ecosystem services are so fundamental to life that they are easy to take for granted and so large in scale that it is hard to imagine that human activities could destroy them.
Nevertheless, ecosystem services are severely threatened through
pollution of land, water, and air resources
Many questions remain unanswered about the workings of ecosystem services.
Ecologists work to help us understand the interconnection and interdependence of the many plant and animal communities within ecosystems.
Although substantial understanding of many ecosystem services and the scientific principles underlying them already exists, there is still much to learn.
The tradeoffs among different services within an ecosystem, the role of biodiversity in maintaining services, and the effects of long and short-term perturbations are just some of the questions that need to be further explored.
The answers to such questions will provide information critical to the development of management strategies that will protect ecosystems and help maintain the provisions of the services upon which we depend.
The choices we make today in how we use land and water resources will have enormous consequences on the future sustainability of earth’s ecosystems and the services they provide.

The article you have just read on ecosystem services is a good primer for the following articles on our site:
In an energy-scarce future, ecosystem services will become more important in supporting the human economy, according to John W. Day Jr. et al.
(BioScience, April 2009).
Moreover, they state that the primary role of ecology will be the sustainable management of ecosystems.
Energy scarcity will affect ecology in a number of ways.
Ecology will become more expensive, which will be justified by its help in solving societal problems, especially in maintaining ecosystem services.

The impact of climate change on invasive plants in the Western U.S. may create restoration opportunities, future perils
A new study by researchers at Princeton University ’s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs has found that global climate change may lead to the retreat of some invasive plant species in the western United States, which could create unprecedented ecological restoration opportunities across millions of acres throughout America.
At the same time, global warming may enable other invasive plants to spread more widely.
The study, “Climate change and plant invasions: restoration opportunities ahead?”, was co-authored by Bethany Bradley, a biogeographer, Michael Oppenheimer, a geoscientist, and David Wilcove, a conservation biologist, at Princeton’s Woodrow Wilson School, and will soon be published in the journal Global Change Biology .
The researchers assessed the relationship between climate change and the distribution of five prominent invasive plants in the western United States – known colloquially as the “kudzus of the West” – cheatgrass; spotted knapweed; yellow starthistle; tamarisk; and leafy spurge.
Such plants are defined as invasive because they were brought into this country from other lands and now dominate and alter ecosystems in ways that threaten native wildlife, agriculture, and ranching.
All have greatly expanded their ranges in recent decades in the western U.S., causing millions of dollars in damage to farmlands and rangelands.
Invasive plants are increasingly expensive to control, and it is widely believed that global warming will make the problem worse.
But Bradley and her co-authors find that global warming may also reduce the competitiveness of some invasive plants if conditions become climatically unsuitable to the weeds, “creating opportunities for restoration in areas currently dominated by intractable invasive species,” according to the study.
The five species were selected in part because they represent the most problematic plants in the western U.S. The study authors created “bioclimatic envelope models,” wherein the authors identified where the invasive plant species occurred, and identified critical climate variables such as precipitation patterns and temperature patterns that are associated with the presence of the invasive plants under investigation.
The authors then determined what combined set of climate variables best described the distribution of these weeds, and mapped all of the places in the U.S. where these climate conditions occur.
Developing such models is important because scientists can use them to assess how changing climate conditions might affect the distributions of invasive plants.
Maps of how invasion risk is likely to change with global warming are also important for land managers designing long-term protocols for fighting invasive plants.
The researchers employed 10 atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) that predict what climatic conditions in the West are likely to be in 2100 if emissions are not limited, and matched those predicted conditions to the climate conditions associated with each of the invasive plant species.
The projected invasive species distributions for each of the models were added together to create a map of invasion risk under future climate conditions.
“Just as native species are expected to shift in range and relative competiveness with climate change,” the authors wrote, “the same should be expected of invasive species.”
Specifically, the researchers concluded that climate change is likely to expand invasion risk from yellow starthistle in California and Nevada – and lands currently occupied by invasive populations of the weed in California, Oregon and Washington are unlikely to become unsuitable for the species; hence, they have low potential for restoration.
Tamarisk distribution, they found, is unlikely to be affected by climate change.
Cheatgrass, however, is likely to be affected by climate change, potentially moving northwards into parts of Idaho, Montana and Wyoming, but retreating in southern Nevada and Utah.
And, according to Bradley and her co-authors, the impacts of climate change will likely shift spotted knapweed, currently distributed throughout the foothills of the Rocky Mountains and the Colorado Plateau, to higher elevations, leading to both expanded risk and restoration opportunities in part of Montana, Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado.
Leafy spurge, abundant in northern states west of the Mississippi River and some rangeland west of the Rockies, will likely retreat from some places in the face of climate change, creating restoration possibilities in Colorado, Nebraska, Iowa, and Minnesota – but potentially expanding into parts of Canada not included in the researchers’ study.
In addition, the researchers found that leafy spurge is likely to retreat from Nebraska and parts of Oregon and Iowa, creating strong potential for restoration in these areas.
To better address the impacts of invasive species, the authors note, further modeling and experimental work is needed to determine which species will be able to occupy these sites if the invasive species are reduced or eliminated by climate change.
Local native plants (the ones that were there prior to the arrival of the invasive species) may be unable to reoccupy these areas as a result of global warming.
If local native plants cannot reoccupy the areas, then native plants from elsewhere in the West will need to be considered for restoration to prevent new invasive species from quickly invading these sites.
“The restoration opportunities associated with the retreat of currently intractable invasive species are vast in the western United States,” the authors wrote.
“The uncertainties associated with these changes, as well as the unknown makeup of viable future vegetation… highlight a pressing need for integrated modeling, monitoring, and experimental work to better address the ecological consequences of climate change.”
“Governments need to reduce emissions quickly to avoid a variety of dangerous climate changes, Oppenheimer warned.
“At the same time, it will be necessary to adapt to the inevitability of some warming.
Proper management of ecosystems to minimize the damages is a key part of any effective adaptation strategy.”
Rather than simply enhancing invasion risk, climate change may also reduce invasive plant competitiveness if conditions become climatically unsuitable.
Using bioclimatic envelope modeling, we show that climate change could result in both range expansion and contraction for five widespread and dominant invasive plants in the western United States.
Yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis) and tamarisk (Tamarix spp.
) are likely to expand with climate change.
Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) and spotted knapweed (Centaurea biebersteinii) are likely to shift in range, leading to both expansion and contraction.
Leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula) is likely to contract.
The retreat of once-intractable invasive species could create restoration opportunities across millions of hectares.
Identifying and establishing native or novel species in places where invasive species contract will pose a considerable challenge for ecologists and land managers.
This challenge must be addressed before other undesirable species invade and eliminate restoration opportunities.
Using his strongest language yet about his intention to arrest climate change, the Illinois senator told a woman he would tap Gore for cabinet – or even higher office.
“I would,” he said.
“Not only will I, but I will make a commitment that Al Gore will be at the table and play a central part in us figuring out how we can solve this problem.
He’s somebody I talk to on a regular basis.
I’m already consulting with him in terms of these issues, but climate change is real.
It is something we have to deal with now, not 10 years from now, not 20 years from now.”
But both Obama and Clinton covet the support of Gore, who since leaving the White House in 2000 has gone on to become one of the world’s leading voices for climate-change action.
I suppose it was inevitable.
Obama funded by drug companies linking up with Gore who has tapped his pocket into climate science.
This will inevitably lead to politicians making decisions to benfit their industries under the pretence to benefit humanity when in fact it will lead to waisting wealth funneled into select industries that will reduce peoples standards of living and make the country poorer.

On the international front, prospects are poor for significant progress.
Globally, and particularly in China and India, economies are being fueled mainly by an ever-expanding use of coal.
The next president will take office just 11 months before a deadline that the world’s nations have set for a new climate treaty, a situation that many experts say almost guarantees a weak result.
Senator Obama envisions legislation that leaves scant wiggle room on emissions cuts and exacts a price from the start for emissions permits.
He would use $15 billion a year from those proceeds to promote non-polluting energy sources and cut energy waste.
In the second debate, Mr. Obama said investments in boosting energy efficiency and the use of non-polluting sources would be part of his economic recovery plan and would not be sacrificed even under a constricted budget.
But he has been criticized by climate activists, who otherwise tend to support him, for statements about pursuing “clean coal” as a climate strategy, one that Mr. McCain also advocates.
The phrase “clean coal” historically has applied to capturing sulfur dioxide and other contaminants released by burning coal.
Capturing carbon dioxide, the main heat-trapping emission, is far harder.
His climate plan, like his opponent’s, includes a declining ceiling for emissions and allows polluters who surpass targets to sell credits to others who have fallen short.
But under the McCain plan, the initial emissions permits would be given away, not sold, saving billions of dollars for the industries affected.
Targets could also be achieved by investing in “carbon offsets,” which are produced by avoiding emissions elsewhere.
“Strengthened institutions and invigorated alliances and partnerships are especially crucial if we are to defeat the epochal, man-made threat to the planet: climate change.
... As the world's largest producer of greenhouse gases, America has the responsibility to lead.
While many of our industrial partners are working hard to reduce their emissions, we are increasing ours at a steady clip — by more than ten percent per decade.
As president, I intend to enact a cap-and-trade system that will dramatically reduce our carbon dioxide emissions.
... Getting our own house in order is only a first step.
... We need a global response to climate change that includes binding and enforceable commitments to reducing emissions, especially for those that pollute the most: the United States, China, India, the European Union, and Russia.”
“I believe climate change is real.
I think it’s devastating.
I think we have to act and I agree with most experts that we may at some point reach a tipping point where we cannot save our climate.
I don't think we’re there yet, but the overwhelming evidence is that greenhouse gases are contributing to warming of our earth and we have an obligation to take action to fix it.
I believe that America did the right thing by not joining the Kyoto Treaty.
But I believe that if we could get China and India into it, then the United States should seriously consider — on our terms — joining with every other nation in the world to try to reduce greenhouse gases.
It's got to be a global effort.”
In a cap-and-trade program, the government would set a ceiling on carbon dioxide emissions and require companies to bid for permits to emit greenhouse gases through an auction.
He wants to reduce carbon emissions 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050, as recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
McCain has not specified what share of the pollution permits he would auction
Co-sponsored the “Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act” of 2007, which would require the U.S. to reduce its emissions by 2050 to 80 percent below 1990 levels.
A group of real estate developers and property owners in La Manga del Mar Menor - a spit of sandy, low-lying coastal land and Murcia's premier beach resort - are threatening to take Greenpeace to court over its graphic predictions of what global warming may do to the area, which they say have caused house prices to plummet.
I read Jeffrey Fisher's letter in The Economists' Voice ( Climate Change Debate Needs Two Sides ).
Here is the summary:
Where are the economists who think climate change isn't happening, isn't manmade, or is too expensive to prevent, wonders Jeffrey Fischer.
Economists who think climate change isn't happening?
Based on what professional knowledge?
Your ability to teach ECO 760: Advanced Micro?
Forgive me for my snide rhetorical questions.
My view is that economists, as part of their professional role, have absolutely nothing to say about the first two concerns.
Economists should take estimates of temperature rise, sea-level rise and etc.
(and their uncertainties) and plug them into economic models and determine the costs and benefits of mitigation.
The only question we can, and should, address is: "is climate change too expensive to prevent"?
There is plenty of economists working on this issue, whether or not it is in The Economists' Voice.
During the debate over the Climate Security Act this past week we could have spent our time performing a valuable public service by focusing on the bill, discussing the merits of cap-and-trade versus carbon taxes, rounding up all of the other posts out there, etc.
The Senate debate focused on bitter disagreement over the expected economic costs of putting a price on carbon dioxide, the leading greenhouse gas that comes from burning fossil fuels.
Opponents said it would lead to higher energy costs.
Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., a chief sponsor of the bill ... and other Democrats said this now lays the groundwork for action on climate change next year with a new Congress and a new president that will be more hospitable to mandatory greenhouse gas reductions.
Both Obama and McCain have called for capping carbon dioxide and other emissions linked to climate change.
President Bush has opposed such measures and said he would have vetoed the Senate bill if he had received it.
Given the importance of the ski industry to the High Country, some reporter somewhere must have taken notice of recent news coverage about the impact of global warming on the ski industry--and the effect that artificial snow making has on the environment.
How important is the ski industry to the economy of western NC?
Well, according to a study by Appalachian State University economics professors Steven W. Millsaps and Peter A. Groothuis, pretty darn important.
To wit, from their 2003 study:
Big impact.
We get that.
But what would happen if that snowfall the ski industry here relies on suddenly got a little more finicky?
Or slowed to a trickle due to global warming?
What would that be like?
I think that Simon deserved to win that bet, but he would have lost a bet on the bigger picture: If there's anything that global warming should tell people, it's that human innovation affects the environment, the environment will give negative feedback, and we will just have to deal with it.
The environment, like some other "goods" with few substitutes (oil, water, ocean, air) is only getting more "expensive" as its quality decays, i.e., as a healthy environment grows more scarce.
Today at Aguanomics: The USDA Sees the Light , i.e., global warming is going to cause severe problems in the western US (and small ones elsewhere).
On numerous issues—ranging from mercury pollution to groundwater contamination to climate change—political appointees have edited scientific documents, manipulated scientific assessments, and generally sought to undermine the science behind dozens of EPA regulations.
Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., the committee chairman, said depositions provided by senior EPA staff members suggest that Johnson had been overruled or heavily influenced by the White House on recent EPA decisions on the smog standard, its rejected of a waiver for California on global warming regulations, and the EPA ongoing deliberations on whether to regulate carbon dioxide.

At the FT today, there's a great overview of the relationship between the incoming Obama administration's views on climate change and the international talks.
(From December 2 through 21 here, I covered the Obama team, some of the salient points about Congress, the EU talks and the UN-sponsored talks in Poland.

Let's hope so.
As UNSG Ban Ki-moon said in Poland: "Yes, the economic crisis is serious.
Yet when it comes to climate change, the stakes are even higher.
The climate crisis affects our potential prosperity and our peoples' lives, both now and far into the future.

Al Gore has really stepped in it this time.
He could have spent the rest of his global warming career collecting money by spreading fear over events that were a century or at least half century in the future.

According to a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration report , coral reefs in the Caribbean face a considerable risk of bleaching and die-offs partly due to rising water temperatures.
The NOAA reported in June that National Climatic Data Center found global ocean temperatures were the highest on record , creating a habitat conducive to bleaching.
That study also found that arctic sea ice had receded drastically from the 1979-2000 period.
China to set carbon emission targets for the year 2050, also warned that the rising sea levels that will result from global warming would displace more people in China
Project Links Global Warming to National Security Threats
Former Senator John Warner (R-VA) teamed up with the Pew Environment Group last week to announce a new project highlighting the links between national security threats and global warming.
"Leading military and security experts agree that if left unchecked, global warming could increase instability and lead to conflict in already fragile regions of the world," said Warner.
"We ignore these facts at the peril of our national security and at great risk to those in uniform who serve this nation.
"
The project will bring together experts on science and military policy to evaluate joint strategies for preventing global warming and protecting national security interests.
This won't be the first venture to investigate the connection between climate change and national security: The National Intelligence Council, a projection arm of the Central Intelligence Agency, recently reported that global warming could threaten energy resources, damage military facilities, increase food shortages, and strain the economy, all of which would greatly burden national defense.
Director Dennis Blair told Congress this year that "global climate change will have important and extensive implications for U.S. national security interests over the next 20 years.
"
A report issued last week on the effects of global warming on storms and flooding is drawing attention in many at-risk areas.
Among the communities taking special notice of the report are Northeast Ohio , which recently experienced record storms and floods; Eastern North Dakota , which has seen the benefits of smart flood planning methods advocated by Dr. Amanda Staudt, author of the report; New England , which has endured abnormally heavy rain in recent months; Northwest Indiana , which is at an increased risk of flooding due to global warming; and Virginia , which has experienced starkly contrasting dry and wet weather periods in the last year.
“Global warming is partly to blame for these heavy rainfall events,” said Dr. Staudt. “Warmer air simply can hold more moisture, so heavier precipitation is expected in the years to come.”
America’s over-reliance on levees and other strategies for taming rivers; communities that are on the frontlines; and what must be done to confront the realities of global warming.The report focuses on how global warming has caused more heavy rainfall events;
The United States is seeing more heavy storms and major floods, and it seems global warming is partly to blame.
The National Wildlife Federation is set to release “Increased Flooding Risk: Global Warming’s Wake-Up Call for Riverfront Communities,” a report detailing how global warming is causing more heavy rainfall events even as America’s over-reliance on levees and other old strategies for taming rivers sidesteps flooding issues.
The report offers a new course of action for confronting the realities of global warming and shielding flood-prone communities from the consequences of unnaturally heavy rainfall.
Perspectives will be provided regarding the latest scientific research on global warming and flooding, the national flood insurance program, and recommendations for how to cope with projected changes and how to avoid the worst impacts of global warming.
According to a major anti-poverty organization, unchecked global warming will exacerbate a crisis already being called "the defining human tragedy of this century": hunger.
Oxfam International says that global warming will bring crop failure, erratic storms, droughts, and a shift in growing seasons, thus increasing the pressure on millions of already-suffering people worldwide to produce the food they need to survive.
The report, "What Happened to the Seasons?
" comes as leaders of the G8 nations prepare to meet in Italy this week to discuss food scarcity, climate change , and other issues.
Deutsche Bank recently unveiled a seven-story 'carbon clock' in Manhattan to keep a ton-by-ton tally of the amount of carbon dioxide being pumped into the atmosphere.
The counter , devised by MIT scientists, reflects the growing need for emission reform: the spinning numbers show that carbon is being added to the atmosphere at a rate of about 800 tons per second.
With lawmakers moving forward on a bold new piece of climate legislation in the House, a green job boom seems to be on the horizon.
“Restoring American’s great waters will benefit the country’s economy and environment—and will be vital in addressing the impacts of global warming,” said Larry Schweiger, president and CEO of the National Wildlife Federation, the host of the summit.
Given the importance of the ski industry to the High Country, some reporter somewhere must have taken notice of recent news coverage about the impact of global warming on the ski industry--and the effect that artificial snow making has on the environment.
How important is the ski industry to the economy of western NC?
Well, according to a study by Appalachian State University economics professors Steven W. Millsaps and Peter A. Groothuis, pretty darn important.
To wit, from their 2003 study:
Big impact.
We get that.
But what would happen if that snowfall the ski industry here relies on suddenly got a little more finicky?
Or slowed to a trickle due to global warming?
What would that be like?
Some folks are already finding out:
Alpine skiing and snowboarding may be under greater threat from climate change than scientists have previously thought, new research suggests.
Artificial snow may help Alpine ski resorts to fight the effects of climate change, but it also creates environmental problems of its own.
Is summer tourism the only thing that can save the struggling resorts?
But in his role as a scientist, he takes a very different view of the artificial white stuff.
Covering entire slopes with manmade powder consumes an enormous amount of energy and water.
And for Strasser, a geographer at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, that's a mountainous problem in a time of climate change .
"Everything under 1,000 meters (3,300 feet) is hit first," says hydrologist Carmen de Jong of the University of Savoy in France.
Then areas above 1,200 meters start getting problems, she explains.
Winter sport resorts don't have many options for coping with climate change.
"The entire infrastructure, for example the lifts, would have to be rebuilt higher up the mountain -- and that's extremely expensive," de Jong says.
While no counties are now in the exceptional drought status that they suffered last year, Buncombe, Avery, Haywood, Henderson, Madison, Mitchell, Transylvania, Polk, Rutherford and Watauga counties remain in extreme drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.
A report [ PDF ] released today by researchers at Tufts University, commissioned by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), presents two ways of estimating the costs of inaction on climate change, both leading to staggering bottom lines.
A comprehensive estimate, based on state-of-the-art computer modeling, finds that doing nothing on global warming will cost the United States economy more than 3.6 percent of GDP - or $3.8 trillion annually (in today’s dollars) - by 2100.
On the other hand, a detailed, bottom-up analysis finds that just four categories of global warming impacts -- hurricane damage, real estate losses, increased energy costs and water costs -- will add up to a price tag of 1.8 percent of U.S. GDP, or almost $1.9 trillion annually (in today’s dollars) by 2100.
But aren't the hurricane damages, almost 25% of the total impacts listed here by 2100, the most uncertain of the negative impacts of climate change?
Congress will soon face its moment of truth on climate-change legislation, prompting the Senate’s Committee on Energy and Natural Resources to convene a Scrabble board of government agencies Tuesday morning to clear up some lingering questions for once and for all.
Such as: How much will this thing cost the U.S. economy, and why are cost estimates all over the place?
The Energy Information Administration (EIA), an independent statistical and analytical agency in the U. S. Department of Energy, released it's Flash Estimate of "U.S. Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Energy Sources for the year 2007," on May 20, 2008, in HTML format .
...
The total emissions reduction, from 7,181.4 million metric tons carbon dioxide equivalent (MMTCO2e) in 2005 to 7,075.6 MMTCO2e in 2006, was largely a result of reductions in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.
...
U.S. carbon dioxide emissions in 2006 were ... below their 2005 level ... due to favorable weather conditions; higher energy prices; a decline in the carbon intensity of electric power generation that resulted from increased use of natural gas, the least carbon-intensive fossil fuel; and greater reliance on non-fossil energy sources.
The housing perhaps-not-entirely-a-crisis resembles, in one particular, the curious consensus about the global warming "crisis," concerning which, the assumption is: Although Earth's temperature has risen and fallen through many millennia, the temperature was exactly right when, in the 1960s, Al Gore became interested in the subject.
Are we to assume that last year, when housing prices were, say, 10 percent higher than they are now, they were exactly right?
If so, why is that so?
Because the market had set those prices, therefore they were where they belonged?
But if the market was the proper arbiter of value then, why is it not the proper arbiter now?
In announcing the decision to protect polar bears under the Endangered Species Act:
While the legal standards under the ESA compel me to list the polar bear as threatened, I want to make clear that this listing will not stop global climate change or prevent any sea ice from melting.
Any real solution requires action by all major economies for it to be effective.
That is why I am taking administrative and regulatory action to make certain the ESA isn't abused to make global warming policies.
Senator John McCain sought to distance himself from President Bush on Monday as he called for a mandatory limit on greenhouse gas emissions in the United States to combat climate change.
... The two Democrats seeking their party’s presidential nomination, Senators Barack Obama of Illinois and Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, criticized the McCain plan as too timid, because their plans would reduce emissions more quickly.
... In his speech, Mr. McCain advocated cutting emissions 60 percent below 1990 levels by the year 2050; Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama propose cutting them by 80 percent in the same time frame, while the Lieberman-Warner bills calls for a 70 percent reduction.
China has overtaken the USA to become the world's No.
1 industrial source of carbon dioxide, the most important global-warming pollutant, according to a scientific study to be published today.
...
Unless China sharply cuts its emissions, "the situation is pretty bleak," says Richard Carson of the University of California, co-author of a study in today's Journal of Environmental Economics and Management.
"There's a lot less time to do something than people previously thought.
"
“ASU economics professor John Whitehead has distanced himself and his department from the report,” Cordato added.
“Whitehead wrote on his Web site that he’s ‘very skeptical’ any positive benefits from climate change policies would cancel out the clear negative impacts.”
... the Environmental Economics blog ... is now the default homepage on my browser (but then again, I guess I am a wonk -- a word I learned on the E.E.

In just a few weeks, we’ve gone from “Drill, Baby!
Drill!” to “Spill, Baby!
Spill!” to “Burn, Baby!
Burn!” and finally to “Scrub, Baby!
Scrub!” Oil spills like the one in the Gulf are not unprecedented , so it should come as no surprise when environmental disasters like this happen at an offshore rig.
What’s surprising is that in over twenty years since the Exxon accident, we’re still no better equipped to clean up major oil spills.
Let’s consider some of the options by the numbers.
As the saying goes, “If you can’t beat ‘em, set ‘em on fire and hope they’ll completely combust before they get to you.” This seems to be the most high-tech solution people can come up with to fix the spill, and yet I can’t help but hear Beavis screaming “Fire!
Fire!” while giggling maniacally.
How much environmental damage does burning all the oil do?
It’s estimated that 210,000 gallons of oil are spilling out each day.
Crude oil has a density of about 800 kg per cubic meter and is about 85% carbon by weight.
From this info, we can find the total amount of carbon released:
If the oil is completely combusted, all this carbon will form the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide.
Carbon dioxide weighs about 3.7 times more than elemental carbon, meaning that burning the oil will release about 2.0×10^6 kg (~2,000 tons) of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each day.
This is like having everyone in New Orleans running a 1,000-Watt hair dryer nonstop.
In 1773, Ben Franklin found that a teaspoon of oil dropped on a calm pond could spread out over an acre.
Lord Rayleigh calculated the thickness of this oil film to be about 1.6 nm.
Presumably, the layer of oil that covers the seagulls would have a similar thickness.
Now consider a spherical seagull with a 1.0 ft diameter¹.
This rotund seagull will have a total surface area of about 0.3 m^2.
From this information, we can estimate the number of seagulls we could cover with oil each day:
Clearly, the best method for cleaning up an oil spill is to avoid having the spill in the first place.
Compared to oil spills, wind spills tend to cause a lot less environmental damage.
How much energy could we get each day by lining the Gulf Coast with wind turbines?
So there you have it.
For the cost of 1.4 trillion seagulls and enormous environmental damage, you get about 1/600th the energy that you would by installing an environmentally friendly wind farm.
> Oil spills like the one in the Gulf are not unprecedented, so it should come as no surprise when environmental disasters like this happen at an offshore rig.
How much damage does the market think the oil spill has done?
Econbrowser is pleased to host this guest contribution from UCSD Ph.D. candidate Ben Fissel , who shares a quick estimate of the economic damage from the Gulf oil spill.
How much damage does the market think the oil spill has done?
At this point it's really hard to tell how much the sinking of Deepwater Horizon and the ensuing oil spill will cost BP.
There are a number of factors still in play, such as "when will the spill be capped?
" or "how much of the oil will hit shore?
" If the leak continues to spew oil unabated for three months, the damage and corresponding cost to BP could be huge.
If the winds shift, minimizing the amount of oil that hits shore, then the costs to BP won't be that bad.
Until there is some resolution of these and other questions, there is a large amount of uncertainty regarding how this will affect BP's profitability.
What we can assess with much more confidence is the market's expectation of the costs.
Stock prices give us a yardstick for the markets perception of a company's long run profitability.
When an event, such as this oil spill, impacts a company it will also impact its long run profitability.
The divergence of the stock price from what we would have expected had the event never happened is a measure of the net present value of the cost incurred by the oil spill.
Event study analysis gives us a framework to answer just this question.
The t-statistic of the cumulative abnormal returns over the event window is -6.33 indicating that the event clearly had an impact that drove BP's share price outside its normal range of variation.
The adjusted closing price of BP on May 4, 2010 was $51.20 whereas had the oil spill not happened I've estimated the price would have been $58.11.
This amounts to a net loss of $6.91 per share.
BP has 3.13 billion shares outstanding amounting to a net loss in $21.62 billion.
This loss reflects the market's expectation of the net present value of the loss in profitability of BP as a result of the oil spill, otherwise interpreted as the cost to BP of the oil spill.
This cost may come from a number of sources besides simply cleanup.
For example, the loss in customers, punitive damages, or possible loss of BP's ability to profit from this or other potential offshore projects may be other ways the oil spill will hurt BP.
This high cost estimate is most consistent with the scenario where BP doesn't cap the major leakage of oil for a substantial amount of time.
Clearly, not only for the sake of the environment but also for the sake of BP's bottom line, they are going to want to cap this oil spill and clean it up quickly.
While applying the loss to total shares outstanding does show the paper loss it does not actually show "market's expectation of the net present value of the loss in profitability of BP as a result of the oil spill.
" Many of those shares never changed hands meaning that the holders exercised faith in BP and have the "expectation" that BP stock will be higher in the future.
The calculation is based on the notion that the price of the asset is equal to the discounted flow of returns to the investor holding the asset.
The costs and lost revenue resulting from the oil spill directly impact future profit and hence the investors return.
This is true for each share.
I remember one of the posters breezily saying that he lived in Florida right by a BP pipeline and had no concerns whatsoever.
Here's hoping that he and all those who are responsible for the dangerous complacency about the environmental damage caused by oil have it wash up on *their* shores, just for the obviously needed lesson.
Prof Hamilton: The net present value of the cost in that paper corresponds to the private cost to BP, not the social cost, such as the negative externalities of the environmental impact.
Perhaps, the title of the paper "How much damage does the market think the oil spill has done?
" should be changed to "How much damage does the market think the oil spill has done to BP?
" (frankly, I care much less about the latter).
New Orleans-based power giant Entergy is in hot water following revelations that its Vermont Yankee nuclear plant has leaked radioactive contamination to the environment -- and its trouble isn't limited to Vermont.
Some background: In January of this year, it was reported that groundwater monitoring wells at Entergy's Vermont Yankee plant in Vernon, Vt. were contaminated with tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen routinely created in nuclear power plants.
In early February, the plant reported that a new groundwater monitoring well at the plant showed levels of tritium at about 775,000 picocuries per liter -- more than 37 times the federal drinking water limit of 20,000 picocuries per liter.
Subsequent tests showed even more dramatic levels of contamination, with direct testing of groundwater on Feb. 6 detecting tritium at levels of 2.45 million picocuries per liter -- almost the same concentration found in reactor process water, which typically has about 2.9 million picocuries of tritium per liter.
The Vermont Department of Health has raised concerns that the contamination is making its way to the nearby Connecticut River.
The tritium contamination has been linked to corroded underground pipes at the 38-year-old plant, where a cooling tower also collapsed in 2007 due corrosion of its support structure.
Adding to the controversy over the tritium contamination is the fact that Entergy had long denied that Vermont Yankee had the kind of underground piping system linked to such leaks, which are so common in the aging U.S. commercial nuclear fleet that the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission has launched a special review of the problem.
With revelations ... that Vermont Yankee is leaking tritium -- a radioactive isotope -- into nearby groundwater, it became clear that those statements were wrong.
Entergy calls it a "miscommunication" and anti-nuclear activists call it a bald lie.
A speech by HRH The Prince of Wales to open the Nobel Laureates Symposium on Climate Change, St James's Palace, London
I really could not be more pleased or grateful that so many Nobel Laureates have been able to join world experts on climate change and influential policy-makers in this Symposium.
Nobel Laureates, of course, are chosen for having ‘conferred the greatest benefit on mankind’.
There could surely be no greater benefit to mankind at this moment in history than to lead the way towards a framework for addressing the inter-related economic, environmental, social, ethical and climate challenges that face our societies.
The fifteenth Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (thankfully abbreviated to COP 15) in Copenhagen in December will be an historic occasion.
World leaders will have the opportunity to take decisions that could lead us all to a safer and more sustainable future.
They will have to identify both what needs to be done, and how it can be achieved, even against a background of considerable economic difficulty.
I believe that a memorandum drawing together the wisdom and authority of this extraordinary group here could, and should, have a real influence on key decisions taken before, during and after Copenhagen.
After all it seems to me that in many ways we already have some of the answers to hand; we know about energy efficiency, renewable energy and how to reduce deforestation, to name but a few, but we seem strangely reluctant to apply them.
I fear that this hesitation will have catastrophic consequences.
The first is urgency.
I don’t know about your own experience, but it seems to me that whilst there is now only a mercifully small (if vociferous!
) number of people who do not accept the science of climate change and who should know better, there are still a great many who fail to recognize the real urgency of the situation.
Even in the last few weeks there has been further evidence from scientists at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and the University of Oxford that it will take much longer for the climate to recover from excessive warming than previously thought.
In so many ways we are already in the ‘Last Chance Saloon’.
The second dimension which I hope you might address is the bigger picture of human interactions with Nature.
This is obviously an immense subject, but whilst climate change is undoubtedly the greatest challenge of our age, it is far from being the only global ecological challenge we face.
It has been described as a “threat multiplier” and in large part the threats that it multiplies are those which arise from our wilful destruction of the ecosystems that provide the essential ecological services on which we all ultimately depend.
For what it is worth, I doubt if we can effectively tackle climate change without first ensuring that those ecosystem functions and services are protected.
As you again know far better than I, those services are all inter-related.
They depend upon a vast array of interactions between different forms of life, the way in which energy flows and the many ways in which Nature recycles waste.
We have been taking them for granted for far too long and, as a consequence, many are under intolerable strain.
In our human-centred world, with its emphasis on economics, and following decades of apparently unending material ‘progress’, it has become all too easy for us to believe that we can continue to take what we wish from natural systems on the assumption that somehow they will indefinitely replenish themselves.
Unfortunately, as we are discovering, in the real world it doesn’t quite work like that.
The dictum, so beloved of economists, of ‘ceterus paribus’, or ‘all things being equal’, is regrettably a thing of the past as, from now on, they aren’t and may not be again.
Climate Change has fractured that essential equilibrium.
A famous study, by Robert Constanza and others, published in 1998, set out to estimate the value of Nature to the human economy by working out roughly what it would cost us to replace all the things that ecosystems provide to us.
The value of rainfall, soil fertility, the work of pollinating insects, the coastal protection provided by coral reefs and mangroves, climatic stability and the medicines derived from wild species, among many others, were estimated to be worth about $33 trillion a year – that’s about twice as much as global GDP, estimated then at $18 trillion.
So, I have always felt it must be possible to devise a gentler, more integrated approach which, above all, values these services properly in the entire accounting and auditing process.
This is why I was so fascinated by The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity report by Pavan Sukhdev.
The first phase of this work has now been published, setting out a clear framework – based on science and economics – for valuing ecosystem services, and identifying policies to enable further progress in this area.
But it also contains insights and advice of a different sort, which policy-makers need to hear.
I think any economist who can write this, for instance, deserves a wide and attentive audience, and I quote -
An earlier and much larger study, the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, went so far as to say that we might very easily not meet the Millennium Development Goals on poverty alleviation if we continue to destroy and degrade natural habitats and ecosystems in the way that we are doing now.
This particular assessment was the most comprehensive stock-take of Nature ever undertaken and its findings should galvanize a transformation in how we approach development in the decades ahead.
But will it?
It revealed how roughly sixty per cent of the ecosystem services that support life on Earth – such as fresh water, wild fisheries, air and water regulation, regional climatic regulation and natural pest control – are being degraded or used unsustainably.
Despite this knowledge, the temptation to continue with “business as usual” is enormously powerful…
The review looked at twenty-four different ecosystem services and found that fifteen of them are suffering ongoing degradation.
It concluded that humans have changed ecosystems more rapidly and extensively in the last fifty years than in any other period.
More land was converted to cropland in the thirty years after 1950 than in the 150 years between 1700 and 1850.
More than half of all the synthetic nitrogen fertilizers, first made in 1913, ever used on the planet has been used since 1985.
As a result of our collective demands, some ten to thirty per cent of the mammal, bird and amphibian species are currently threatened with extinction.
The links between environmental, social and climate challenges are so strong that we need integrated solutions that address the underlying issues.
That must include looking for solutions that work ‘with the grain’ of Nature.
It is only too tempting to look for ‘techno-fix’ solutions, using all our power and ingenuity in the hope of coming up with something so startlingly clever and brilliant that all our problems will simply disappear.
This seems to apply with regard to climate change, in particular, where all sorts of ‘geo-engineering’ schemes have been suggested.
Given mankind’s rather poor track record of understanding the environmental implications of such major interventions, I fear that the cure may prove to be potentially even worse than the disease.
Integrated thinking, with sustainability firmly in mind, is also required in the third of the three dimensions I wanted to suggest to you – and that is the crucial importance of massively reducing the amount of tropical deforestation.
Deforestation contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, and both the associated loss of eco-system services and climate change will have a major impact on economic development and efforts to alleviate poverty.
Tackling any one of these facets in isolation is a recipe for disaster.
As you are only too aware, the problem is immense and complex.
About a fifth of carbon dioxide emissions arise from deforestation, especially the clearance of the tropical rainforests.
That is not all, however, for not only do rainforests store carbon – year on year they absorb about fifteen per cent of the emissions coming from fossil fuels.
So while they are about twenty per cent of the problem – and this is the point – they are in reality approximately thirty-five per cent of the solution.
The rainforests also produce much of the world’s rainfall.
From the Amazon basin forests alone some twenty billion tonnes of water are evaporated into the atmosphere every single day.
Deforestation obviously reduces this amount, so decreasing subsequent rainfall in the rainforests but also, it increasingly appears, changing precipitation patterns across the world and contributing to food shortages.
You will be aware, ladies and gentlemen, that much time is starting to be spent debating the linkages between food security, energy security and economic security.
Solving climate change is the precondition to ensuring security and without adequately addressing tropical deforestation we cannot have an answer to climate change.
It is that simple; saving the rainforests is not an option, it is an absolute necessity.
Most of the rainforests are, of course, located in poorer countries where the trees, the fauna and flora, and the land beneath them, have historically been a source of economic development.
This is why the clearance of these unique ecosystems, with their associated biodiversity so essential to human survival on this planet (the only one we have, after all), strikes me as axiomatic of the wider struggle we face in achieving a more sustainable view of progress; improving the wellbeing of people and ending poverty need not entail the large-scale degradation of ecosystems upon which we all so fundamentally rely.
This is why about eighteen months ago I set up my Rainforests Project in response to the deep concern of various experts at the situation.
I don’t know why they came to me, but they did, and so I felt constrained to see what I could do to help on a “nothing ventured, nothing gained” basis.
The aim, therefore, has been to consult as widely as possible and to seek out solutions to this apparently intractable problem by working with the private, public and N.G.O.
sectors to try and create a global consensus.
Happily, we are making progress, not least through helping to build international agreement as to how countries can work together to meet this shared global challenge.
Proposals are beginning to emerge as to how the roughly 25 billion dollars per year needed to make a significant impact might be mobilized.
Such a sum may seem large but, interestingly, is equivalent to 1% of the sum paid out annually on insurance premia around the world.
Far from being a charitable hand-out, I see the transfer of money to save the rainforests as equivalent to paying a utility bill for gas, water or electricity only that, in, this case, it is for the climatic and other services that are so essential to the whole world.
Securing the finances needed to combat the forces of deforestation will require innovative new partnerships and funding mechanisms.
Several proposals have been put forward.
One that emerged from my Rainforests Project involves the issuance of new government-backed rainforest bonds.
These would be offered to the investment community and could provide companies in, for example, the pensions and insurance sectors, with whom we have been working for the past two years with the Cambridge Programme for Sustainability Leadership, guaranteed returns while, at the same time, making available some of the significant resources needed to help slow down deforestation.
The money could be paid back using a whole range of different funding streams, including auction revenues from emissions trading schemes.
Now, the answer to deforestation does not lie in the forestry sector alone and that is why any funding needs to be targetted at least across the agricultural, energy and forest sectors to ensure the maximum impact on poverty, by providing education, health care and funding for sustainable farming and agro-forestry schemes, which includes the restoration of the vast areas, and they are vast, of already degraded land that surround the rainforests.
According to U.N.D.P.
there are some eighty million hectares of degraded land in Brazil alone.
And in Indonesia, where I went last year, it is in the region of 45 million.
So not only could it help to alleviate poverty and offer economic benefits, it may also heal some of the damage to the region's ecology.
We also have a role to play as, to a very large extent, rainforest countries are reacting perfectly rationally to the economic price signal that we send by our demand for soya, beef and palm oil.
We are all in this together and perhaps, particularly in the developed world, we need to demonstrate that we understand the current climate change crisis is very much of our own making, all be it unwittingly, and that the credibility of any global solution depends on us being seen to make concerted efforts to change our ways.
That is why it seems to me that the opportunity we have for saving the forests could be a powerful example of the kind of vision we should embrace for the future – in which economic development, improving people’s lives and saving the natural capital and ecosystem services on which we all depend go hand-in-hand, rather than being seen as choices.
And in this regard, I know there are many wonderfully innovative, appropriate and beneficial projects being carried out around the world by voluntary organizations, charities and N.G.O.’s that demonstrate such an integrated approach.
What it needs, if you will forgive me for saying so, is for these erstwhile “alternative” projects to become more mainstream, thereby creating a genuinely human, community-based form of globalization – “from the bottom up”, if you like, – rather than the current model which is increasingly unfit for purpose and too often contributes to the destruction of many people’s cultures and identity, as well as going against the very grain of their existence.
I fear that our grandchildren will not care very much about whether in these early decades of the Twenty-First Century we managed to sustain Twentieth Century-style economic growth.
What they will be far more concerned about, I suspect, is the state of the Earth’s climate; about whether there is sufficient food and water; about the security measures and economic resources needed to cope with millions of environmental refugees.
That, in turn, will require a different, more holistic way of looking at economic growth.
We will need to see the emergence of a genuinely sustainable economy.
An economy that not only takes care of both people and planet, but also breaks the conventional mould in terms of how we look at the world.
And we will need to develop a form of globalization that empowers local communities and local cultures, with all their accumulated wisdom, to maintain their own environments.
Enabling these things to occur seems to me to be not only our most urgent priority, but also our greatest opportunity.
Hayden Panettiere, Mischa Barton, Ellen Page—everyone’s going green these days, but saving the environment is a large task for anyone to take on, especially a teenager.
Yet the everyday green girls profiled here have a passion—to do just that.
They’ve stepped up, taken the initiative, and made their voices heard, and in doing so, they have helped to effect change—from creating a cosmetics line free of toxic chemicals to trying to conquer global warming to encouraging the use of wind power.
Filled with stories from real girls who made a difference, plus lots of celebrity green girls who are doing their part to help out, Girls Gone Green gives girls everywhere the inspiration to do something to help their world.
It doesn’t matter how small the change is—it only matters that you make the effort to bring about that change.

An Inconvenient Truth: The Planetary Emergency of Global Warming and What We Can Do About It
An Inconvenient Truth—Gore’s groundbreaking, battle cry of a follow-up to the bestselling Earth in the Balance—is being published to tie in with a documentary film of the same name.
Both the book and film were inspired by a series of multimedia presentations on global warming that Gore created and delivers to groups around the world.
With this book, Gore, who is one of our environmental heroes—and a leading expert—brings together leading-edge research from top scientists around the world; photographs, charts, and other illustrations; and personal anecdotes and observations to document the fast pace and wide scope of global warming.
He presents, with alarming clarity and conclusiveness—and with humor, too—that the fact of global warming is not in question and that its consequences for the world we live in will be disastrous if left unchecked.
This riveting new book—written in an accessible, entertaining style—will open the eyes of even the most skeptical.
First published in 1992, it helped place the environment on the national agenda; now, as environmental issues move front-and-center in the public consciousness, the time is right to reflect deeply on the fate of our planet and commit ourselves to its future.
While An Inconvenient Truth closely examines one menace to our environment global warming Earth in Balance takes a broader approach, focusing on the threats that everyday choices pose to our climate, water, soil, and diversity of plant and animal life.
A passionate, lifelong defender of the environment, Gore describes in brave and unforgettable terms how human actions and decisions can endanger or safeguard the vulnerable ecosystem that sustains us.
Our Choice: A Plan to Solve the Climate Crisis
Our Choice will pick up where An Inconvenient Truth left off, providing a blueprint for solving the global climate crisis and drawing on Mr. Gore’s 40 years of experience as a student, policymaker, author, ﬁlmmaker, entrepreneur, and activist.
A co-recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 for his environmental work, Mr. Gore illuminates the real solutions to the climate crisis and describes a comprehensive global strategy to implement them urgently.
Our Choice will be an inspiring call to action for those ready to ﬁght for solutions that really work—including some bold initiatives that were deemed impossible only a short time ago but are now gaining support around the world.
This essential guide will help you understand why global warming happens, how it affects the planet, and the simple steps you can take to get involved in protecting the environment.
Fight Global Warming Now: The Handbook for Taking Action in Your Community
Bestselling author Bill McKibben turns activist in the first hands-on guidebook to stopping climate change, the world’s greatest threat Hurricane Katrina.
A rapidly disappearing Arctic.
The warmest winter on the East Coast in recorded history.
The leading scientist at NASA warns that we have only ten years to reverse climate change; the British government’s report on global warming estimates that the financial impact will be greater than the Great Depression and both world wars—combined.
Bill McKibben, the author of the first major book on global warming, The End of Nature, warns that it’s no longer time to debate global warming, it’s time to fight it.
Drawing on the experience of Step It Up, a national day of rallies held on April 14, McKibben and the Step It Up team of organizers provide the facts of what must change to save the climate and show how to build the fight in your community, church, or college.
They describe how to launch online grassroots campaigns, generate persuasive political pressure, plan high-profile events that will draw media attention, and other effective actions.
This essential book offers the blueprint for a mighty new movement against the most urgent challenge facing us today.
Earth Pledge (a New York group that "identifies and promotes innovative techniques and technologies that restore the balance between human and natural systems") promotes the benefits and design possibilities of environmentally conceived roof gardens in this illustrated volume.
A pair of introductory chapters examines green roofs in the context of urban design and as a solution to such environmental challenges as the urban heat island effect, stormwater runoff pollution, resource use, disappearance of native species, and human health.
Forty case studies of design, accompanied by color photographs, demonstrate the variety of green roof projects that can be found around the world.
Finally, seven more case studies look at how urban planners have encouraged green roof infrastructure in Berlin, Tokyo, London, Portland, Chicago, Toronto, and New York.

Divided into three sections, Hope, Human and Wild profiles the efforts of three caring communities to preserve wilderness and reverse environmental devastation.
They include the reforestation of McKibben’s home territory, New York’s Adirondack Mountains; solving traffic and pollution problems in the densely populated Curitiba, Brazil; and how the citizens of Kerala, India have demonstrated that quality of life doesn’t depend on overconsumption of resources.
This edition features a new introduction that revisits these places and explores how they’ve changed over the years.
Stop Global Warming: The Solution is You!
For many Americans, 2006 will be remembered as the year the issue of global warming reached critical mass.
But with all the news of rising temperatures and dwindling ice caps, it's difficult to get beyond the gloom and doom to real corrective measures.
StopGlobalWarming.org founder Laurie David wants to turn negative headlines into positive action.
Her Stop Global Warming!
provides a concise scientific brief about global warming, then moves on to specific actions and strategies.
Powerful, impassioned essays on living and being in the world, from the bestselling author of The End of Nature and Deep Economy For a Generation, Bill McKibben has been among America’s most impassioned and beloved writers on our relationship to our world and our environment.
His groundbreaking book on climate change, The End of Nature, is considered “as important as Rachel Carson’s classic Silent Spring”* and Deep Economy, his “deeply thoughtful and mind-expanding”** exploration of globalization, helped awaken and fuel a movement to restore local economies.
This impassioned plea for radical and life-renewing change is today still considered a groundbreaking work in environmental studies.
McKibben's argument that the survival of the globe is dependent on a fundamental, philosophical shift in the way we relate to nature is more relevant than ever.
McKibben writes of our earth's environmental cataclysm, addressing such core issues as the greenhouse effect, acid rain, and the depletion of the ozone layer.
His new introduction addresses some of the latest environmental issues that have risen during the 1990s.
The book also includes an invaluable new appendix of facts and figures that surveys the progress of the environmental movement.
You Can Save the Earth focuses on real-life, simple solutions to many of our global problems, and emphasizes steps that can be taken on an individual basis or on a local level to promote environmental awareness and conservation.
A report [ PDF ] released today by researchers at Tufts University, commissioned by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), presents two ways of estimating the costs of inaction on climate change, both leading to staggering bottom lines.
A comprehensive estimate, based on state-of-the-art computer modeling, finds that doing nothing on global warming will cost the United States economy more than 3.6 percent of GDP - or $3.8 trillion annually (in today’s dollars) - by 2100.
On the other hand, a detailed, bottom-up analysis finds that just four categories of global warming impacts -- hurricane damage, real estate losses, increased energy costs and water costs -- will add up to a price tag of 1.8 percent of U.S. GDP, or almost $1.9 trillion annually (in today’s dollars) by 2100.
But aren't the hurricane damages, almost 25% of the total impacts listed here by 2100, the most uncertain of the negative impacts of climate change?
Some consideration should be made that there is equal evidence that global warming will have no effect on hurricane frequency or intensity and equal evidence that global warming will lower hurricane frequency and intensity.
Also see this interesting graph from Junk Science about hurricane frequency from 1850 to prestent.
It's b) that I'm especially interested in.
My concern is that maybe, the last page of Ayres might be more realistic, in which US GDP depends at least somewhat on energy & efficiency, and could actually stop growing under some assumptions.
I'd love to get convinced out of this, because if it's true, the climate damage in the NRDC report is a much bigger fraction of US GDP.
I'd love to get convinced out of this, because if it's true, the climate damage in the NRDC report is a much bigger fraction of US GDP.
John, I just glanced at the NRDC press release, so I could be wrong about this particular impact assessment.
However, other ones I've seen calculate global warming damages in terms of percentages of GDP, and so the absolute size of GDP (in those studies) wouldn't affect the percentage estimate of damages.
This is why, for example, it matters whether you calculate foreign GDPs using market exchange rates versus purchasing power parity.
Because if you say, "Global warming will destroy 3% of China's GDP in the year x," then it matters how you convert China's GDP into US dollars.
But aren't the hurricane damages, almost 25% of the total impacts listed here by 2100, the most uncertain of the negative impacts of climate change?
That was my understanding as well.
I don't have the book in my office at the moment, but in The Deniers the author quotes one of the world's leading authorities on hurricanes, and in his opinion there's no convincing evidence that global warming causes more intense hurricanes.
(At least, that was his opinion a couple of years ago, when someone held a press conference saying the opposite and he was aghast.
)
And if I'm not mistaken, Lindzen (whom people either love or hate) argues that just on the surface, it makes no sense to say that global warming would lead to more intense storms.
What has happened is that colder areas warm more than hot areas, and so global warming in the 20th century has tended to reduce temperature differentials.
So how, Lindzen asks, is this supposed to generate more intense storms?
This is very different from computing costs as percentage of GDP, and then adding up.
For example, to pick an example where local governments are already concerned , the San Francisco Bay Area has a massive amount of infrastructure built at/near sea level, and much of the San Joaquin-Sacramento River Delta area [major agriculture, water supplies for many people] is already below sea level, in a seismically-active region.

The housing perhaps-not-entirely-a-crisis resembles, in one particular, the curious consensus about the global warming "crisis," concerning which, the assumption is: Although Earth's temperature has risen and fallen through many millennia, the temperature was exactly right when, in the 1960s, Al Gore became interested in the subject.
Are we to assume that last year, when housing prices were, say, 10 percent higher than they are now, they were exactly right?
If so, why is that so?
Because the market had set those prices, therefore they were where they belonged?
But if the market was the proper arbiter of value then, why is it not the proper arbiter now?
As luck would have it, Will's wisdom was manifested upon us simultaneously with an accounting of the measurable effects upon the biosphere owing to global warming to present, published in Nature this week!
You can read about it on "Climate Feedback," one of Nature's blogs.
However I think that might be a bit unfair.
For one thing, I think a lot of those who are very concerned about climate change could quite consistently say, "No it's not, look at all the damage that has already been done.
Ideally we would not only stop adding CO2, but we'd remove some of what we've already pumped into the atmosphere.
"
Tim: I'm struggling with the point of your question.
Homo sap has pretty much occupied the whole world now and is using a huge fraction of natural resources (water for growing food, atmosphere for dumping our waste, land for the gamut of our activities, etc).
It is a very reasonable assumption that we (humanity as a whole) will be able to extract less of what we need (food, fish, fiber) as temperatures rise to: melt the ice, redirect storm track and rain fall, increase extremes (violent storms, droughts, heat waves).
Now, I do not doubt that people like G. F. Will and the board at Exxon-Mobile will continue to live well, but the rest?
One other point that I might raise is who, what is this "nature" that you talk of?
Is "nature" business as usual or ?
Sorry to catch this post so late, but hopefully someone is still following it.
The answer here actually seems quite simple: our current human world was built on the assumption of a relatively fixed climate, with the average temperature staying within a few degrees of where it was back when George Will was first getting interested in politics.
Now, we have all of this infrastructure resting on that environmental assumption - coastal cities, farming regions, water supplies, transportation routes and so on.
Unfortunately, anthropogenic temperature increases are going to wreak havoc with all of that.

blog). That is a very nice service to the profession.
Now, however, that progress may be coming undone.
The accumulation of greenhouse gasses threatens to simultaneously, and in unpredictable and potentially dramatic ways, alter nearly every variable with an input into the grand equation that is our food production system.
Because the timing and magnitude of any one of these changes is hard to forecast, and especially because each individual variable is involved in innumerable and complex interactions, it is nearly impossible to predict, on a large scale, just how our agriculture, livestock, and fisheries will respond to the new climate conditions we have created for ourselves.
However, by inspecting the following individual effects, a clearer
Higher concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide allow plants to grow faster and larger.
From a food production standpoint, this is generally good news.
Yields should increase, less fertilizer may be needed, and faster growing crops can open new, previously marginal, lands to agriculture.
However, not all the effects of carbon dioxide fertilization will prove beneficial.
For instance, the magnitude of the CO2 fertilization effect is different for different types of plant species.
Among those that will benefit the most are many weed species, triggering concerns from farmers about competition in their fields and from environmentalists about greater use of herbicides.
Plants growing under heightened CO2 conditions can exhibit abnormal characteristics with regard to the way they absorb and process nutrients.
Also, CO2 fertilization can sometimes cause plants to speed through the growth phase in which they generate their harvestable grains, fruits or vegetable matter.
As a result, fields filled with more outright biomass may, at the same time, produce diminished and less nutritious harvests.
Global warming is certain to produce changes in the way water cycles through our oceans, into the atmosphere and over the land.
As rising heat drives accelerated evaporation, land and crops growing on them will potentially dry
out faster.
However, at the same time, more moisture will be drawn from the oceans, causing overall precipitation to increase.
Rarely will changes in these countervailing forces simply offset each other to preserve the status quo.
Much more frequently, specific localities and the food resources supported there will face new trends in water availability.
Areas that currently derive water from melting glaciers and snow-pack are likely to see some dramatic changes as well.
Himalayan glaciers, for instance, which now provide the majority of nonmonsoon water flow for some of Asia’s most important agricultural regions, are in danger of shrinking or even disappearing completely as a result of global warming.
In other areas, where an annual snow-pack serves as an important water resource, rising temperatures will alter the yearly precipitation timing and mix.
For instance, in the American
West, diminished snow pack and earlier, faster melts are likely to leave many areas regularly facing late summer droughts and an increased incidence of forest fires.
As global warming increases the baseline temperature at most locations on our planet, those organisms or populations that are free to move in order to remain in their ideal temperature range, will.
At the global level, this will produce mixed effects.
Some food producers, especially those at higher latitudes and altitudes, may welcome the opportunity to grow, raise, and harvest plants and animals in areas formerly too cool for that activity.
Those in temperate climate zones will be forced to adopt new practices better suited to a more tropical environement.
Still others, especially those in the newly superheated tropics, will face an unprecedented climate zone, for which no food producing species have had time to evolve.
On the whole, this phenomenon of range shifting can pose a real danger to fisheries, livestock, and agriculture.
To begin with, temperature-induced range changes may push populations into new areas for which they are otherwise poorly adapted.
It may render obsolete local cultures, economies, and infrastructure that had been uniquely shaped around specific food resources Global biodiversity will dwindle as some high altitude and polar climates simply cease to exist.
Most menacing of all is the fact that these climate zone shifts are not monolithic, orderly processes that will affect all members of an ecosystem simultaneously.
Some species will shift more readily and quickly, while others may experience almost no range shift.
This uneven movement of ranges will decouple intricately choreographed intra-species relationships that have developed through thousands, if not millions, of years of co-evolution.
The range, migration habits, and life cycles between pollinators and plants, pests and their prey, and wild food-stocks and
In general, agricultural producers will face less stress from extreme cold events and freezes but higher stress from more frequent and more intense heat waves.
As heat energy accumulates in our atmosphere and oceans it may produce more frequent and powerful storms (including, but not limited to, hurricanes) along
with the tornadoes, hail, lightning, high winds, and flooding that they can bring.
Each can damage crops, kill or stress livestock, and disrupt or destroy both natural resources and necessary infrastructure.
These organisms can harm, poison, eat, or otherwise reduce the yield of the species we use as food.
All tend to thrive and spread more rapaciously in warmer and more humid climates.
Furthermore, as fewer and fewer
Global warming is causing ocean levels to rise and is therefore rendering agricultural areas, such as low-lying, but usually very fertile river deltas, and brackish estuaries, which often serve as critical nurseries for commercial fish species, increasingly susceptible to saltwater intrusion and inundation.
Atmospheric carbon dioxide has always naturally dissolved into our oceans.
Now, however, the rate at which this is happening is increasing and, as a result, the ocean is becoming more acidic.
Under these conditions it is more difficult for sea creatures to develop and maintain their calcium based shells and exoskeletons.
As a result, populations of certain species used directly as food sources ( such as mollusks and clams) and others that form the foundations of important marine structures and food chains (like corals and some plankton species) will experience stress and could eventually even collapse.
It is important that we develop capacities to better understand global climate trends and extrapolate from them more localized, near-term weather forecasts that can
then be used in order to prepare for the coming changes.
The accomplishment of this task will require policies and investments that allow for better integration of, and access to, data sets related to climate change and weather.
Multidisciplinary response programs should
While this technology holds great promise, it is not without its drawbacks.
Chief among them is the concern that genetically modified organisms willinterbreed with and therefore “pollute” or reduce the diversity in a species’s gene pool.
Doing so would limit the variety of traits exhibited by a species and therefore also limit the pool from which desirable traits can be identified and propagated.
Special attention must also be given to preserving a wide and diverse gene pool against the threats to biodiversity posed by habitat loss and a
In almost every way, the expected distribution of positive and negative climate change effects has the appearance of being unfair.
As we have read, climate change, at least in the short and medium time frame, may produce positive as well as negative effects.
However, these effects are not equally distributed.
The preponderance of those beneficial effects will occur in higher latitudes, mostly in well-developed Northern Hemisphere countries -- the same ones, incidentally, that have historically played the biggest role in emitting the greenhouse gasses that are now causing climate change.
By contrast, equatorial regions, populated
challenges, but also are responsible for only a small percentage of historic greenhouse gas emissions, are the most likely to bear the burden of the negative effects of climate change.
and interlinked scientific community, adequate access to capital, and suitable infrastructure for all.
These improvements are not only positive in their own right, but also required in any region that hopes to successfully cope with climate change.
Polar regions include the Arctic in the Northern Hemisphere and Antarctica in the Southern Hemisphere.
The Arctic encompasses a large, mostly frozen ocean surrounded by land, is home to almost four million people ( ACIA, 2004 ), and includes some or all of the territories of eight nations, including the United States.
By contrast, Antarctica is an ice-covered continent surrounded by ocean and is generally uninhabited.
The Arctic is expected to experience the greatest rates of warming compared with other world regions ( IPCC, 2007a ).
In part, this is because ice has greater reflectivity (also known as albedo) than the ocean or land.
Melting of highly reflective snow and ice reveals darker land and ocean surfaces, increasing absorption of the sun's heat and further warming the planet, especially in those regions.
There is evidence that climate change is already having observable impacts in the Arctic and in Antarctica.
Many of these observed changes are consistent with the expected effects of climate change under a range of climate scenarios.
Figure 1: Observed sea ice changes.
This animation shows sea ice coverage shrinking from 1979 to 2005, by roughly half.

Widespread melting of glaciers and sea ice and rising permafrost temperatures present additional evidence of strong Arctic warming (see Figure 1).
The above trends are expected to continue during this century, resulting from ongoing increases in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (though greenhouse gases do not primarily originate from the Arctic).
Ocean acidification will adversely affect marine calcifiers by making it more difficult for these organisms to form protective shells
Reduction in sea ice is very likely to have devastating consequences for polar bears, ice-dependent seals, and local people for whom these animals are a primary food source.
Arctic impacts will have implications for biodiversity around the world because migratory species depend on breeding and feeding grounds in the Arctic.
Reduced sea ice is likely to increase marine access to the region’s resources, expanding opportunities for shipping and possibly for offshore oil extraction (although operations could be hampered initially by increasing movement of sea ice in some areas).
Increased areas of tree growth in the Arctic could serve to take up carbon dioxide (CO2, the principal greenhouse gas emitted by human activities) and supply more wood products and related employment, providing local and global benefits.
However, tree growth would mean absorption of additional sunlight (as the land surface would become darker and less reflective) and add to regional warming.
Climate change is taking place within the context of many other ongoing changes in the Arctic, including observed increases in chemical contaminants entering the Arctic from other regions, overfishing, land use changes that result in habitat destruction and fragmentation, rapid growth in the human population, and cultural, governance and economic changes.
The conclusions of the ACIA report are further supported by evidence from remote sensing technologies.
Satellites and U.S. and British Navy submarines have provided data on retreating Arctic sea ice and decreasing Arctic ice thickness.
Satellite data show that the extent of Arctic sea ice has decreased by about three percent per decade.
Figure 2 below shows trends in Arctic sea ice extent since the 1860s.
Figure 2: Long-term trends in Northern Hemisphere sea ice extent for March and September, Nordic sea ice extent for April, and Russian Arctic sea ice extent anomaly (compared with the mean for the entire period) for August.
Source: IPCC, 2007a
Upward-looking sonar data from U.S. Navy submarines between 1987 and 1997 show it is very likely that average ice thickness in the Arctic has decreased by up to 1 meter ( IPCC, 2007a ).
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC 2007a and 2007b ) supports and extends the ACIA’s conclusions with additional evidence.
The IPCC notes that “the resilience shown historically by Arctic Indigenous Peoples is now being severely tested,” with impacts on food availability and personal safety that are changing hunting and traveling practices.
Community infrastructures will be harmed by the warming and thawing of permafrost.
A less severe climate may bring benefits as well, such as reduced heating costs, new agricultural and forestry opportunities, and more navigable northern sea routes, but such benefits will depend on local conditions.
Like the Arctic in the Northern Hemisphere, Antarctica in the Southern Hemisphere has been experiencing effects attributable to changes in regional climate.
Future changes resulting from global climate change are also expected to be significant in this region of the world.
Over the past half-century, there has been a marked warming trend in the Antarctic Peninsula.
Much of the rest of Antarctica has cooled during the last 30 years, due to ozone depletion and other factors, but this trend is likely to reverse.
Surface waters of the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica have warmed and become less saline, and precipitation in this region has increased ( IPCC, 2007a ).
Antarctica has experienced significant retreat and collapse of ice shelves, the result of regional warming.
The loss of these ice shelves has few direct impacts on sea level and global climate.
Because the ice shelves were floating, their melting does not directly add to sea level rise.
They usually are replaced by sea-ice cover, so overall albedo (reflectivity) changes very little ( IPCC, 2007a ).
Satellite observations show no significant change in Antarctic sea-ice extent over the 1973-2005 period.
Analysis of whaling records and modeling studies provide some evidence for longer-term declines in sea ice extent in some regions, but there are not enough data to provide firm conclusions ( IPCC, 2007a ).
As climate change continues, most of the land-based Antarctic ice sheet is actually likely to thicken if projected warming increases snowfall.
There is a small risk, however, that the West Antarctic ice sheet will retreat in coming centuries.
This is because the West Antarctic ice sheet is moored in an oceanic basin, where slippery mud covers the basin floor.
This unique setting makes the ice sheet potentially unstable ( IPCC, 2007a ).

Climate change refers to any significant change in measures of climate (such as temperature, precipitation or wind) lasting for an extended period (decades or longer).
For full definitions of "climate change" and "global warming," see the Basic Information page.
As through much of its history, the Earth's climate is changing.
Right now it is getting warmer.
Most of the warming in recent decades is very likely 1 the result of human activities ( IPCC, 2007 ).
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) State of the Climate Report and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Surface Temperature Analysis indicate the average temperature of the Earth’s surface has increased by about 1.2 to 1.4ºF since 1900.
Other aspects of the climate are also changing such as precipitation patterns and storminess.
Energy from the Sun drives the Earth's weather and climate.
The Earth absorbs energy from the Sun, and also radiates energy back into space.
However, much of this energy going back to space is absorbed by “greenhouse” gases in the atmosphere (see Figure 1 of Greenhouse Effect).
Because the atmosphere then radiates most of this energy back to the Earth’s surface, our planet is warmer than it would be if the atmosphere did not contain these gases.
Without this natural " greenhouse effect ," temperatures would be about 60ºF lower than they are now, and life as we know it today would not be possible.
During the past century humans have substantially added to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels such as coal, natural gas, oil and gasoline to power our cars, factories, utilities and appliances.
The added gases — primarily carbon dioxide and methane — are enhancing the natural greenhouse effect, and likely contributing to an increase in global average temperature and related climate changes.

Other terms used to communicate confidence include “extremely likely” (greater than 95% chance the result is true); "likely" (greater than 66% chance the result is true) and “extremely unlikely” (less than 5%).
The term “virtually certain" conveys that there is a greater than 99% chance that a result is true.
These judgmental estimates originate from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC, 2007 ).
The Clean Energy-Environment State Partnership Program is a voluntary state-federal partnership that encourages states to develop and implement cost-effective clean energy and environmental strategies.
These strategies help further both environmental and clean energy goals while achieving public health and economic benefits.
Under the Partnership Program, states work across their relevant agencies to develop and implement a comprehensive strategy for using existing and new energy policies and programs to promote energy efficiency, clean distributed generation, renewable energy and other clean energy sources that can provide air quality and other benefits.
Climate Leaders is an EPA industry-government partnership that works with companies to develop comprehensive climate change strategies.
Partner companies commit to reducing their impact on the global environment by setting aggressive greenhouse gas reduction goals.
Through program participation, companies create a credible record of their accomplishments and receive EPA recognition as corporate environmental leaders.
Climate Leaders Partners range from Fortune 100 corporations to small businesses and represent a variety of industries and sectors, from manufacturers and utilities to financial institutions and retailers, with operations in all 50 states.
The CHP Partnership is a voluntary program to reduce the environmental impact of power generation by promoting the use of CHP.
CHP is an efficient, clean and reliable approach to generating power and thermal energy from a single fuel source.
The Partnership works closely with energy users, the CHP industry, state and local governments and other stakeholders to support the development of new projects and promote their energy, environmental and economic benefits.
EPA Office of Transportation and Air Quality Voluntary Programs
Transportation and Air Quality voluntary programs aim to reduce pollution and improve air quality by means of forming partnerships with small and large businesses, citizen groups, industry, manufacturers, trade associations and state and local governments.
For example, in February 2004 EPA announced the SmartWay Transport Partnership .
The Partnership is a collaborative voluntary program between EPA and the freight industry that will increase the energy efficiency and energy security of our country while significantly reducing air pollution and greenhouse gases.
Additional transportation and air quality voluntary programs at EPA include: the Green Vehicle Guide, Voluntary Diesel Retrofit Program, Clean School Bus USA, Best Workplaces for Commuters and It All Adds Up to Cleaner Air.
EPA has a set of voluntary industry partnerships that are substantially reducing U.S. emissions of high global warming potential (high GWP) gases.
These synthetic gases - including perfluorocarbons (PFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) - are manufactured for commercial use or generated as waste byproducts of industrial operations.
Some of these gases have valuable uses as substitutes for ozone depleting substances.
However, some species of these gases, while released in small quantities, are extremely potent greenhouse gases with very long atmospheric lifetimes.
The high GWP partnership programs involve several industries, including HCFC-22 producers, primary aluminum smelters, semiconductor manufacturers, electric power companies and magnesium smelters and die-casters.
These industries are reducing greenhouse gas emissions by developing and implementing cost-effective improvements to their industrial processes.
To date, these voluntary programs have achieved significant emission reductions and industry partners are expected to maintain emissions below 1990 levels beyond the year 2010.
WasteWise is a voluntary EPA program through which organizations eliminate costly municipal solid waste and select industrial wastes, benefiting their bottom line and reducing the amount of waste deposited in landfills.
WasteWise is a flexible program that allows partners to design their own waste reduction programs tailored to their needs.
Waste reduction can save organizations money through reduced purchasing and waste disposal costs.
WasteWise provides free technical assistance to help organizations develop, implement and measure their waste reduction activities.
In February 2010, President Obama announced a Presidential Memorandum creating an Interagency Task Force on Carbon Capture and Storage to develop a comprehensive and coordinated federal strategy to speed the development and deployment of clean coal technologies.
The Task Force will develop a proposed plan to overcome the barriers to the widespread, cost-effective deployment of CCS within 10 years, with a goal of bringing 5 to 10 commercial demonstration projects online by 2016.
The Co-Chairs of the Task Force include senior officials from the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
Other federal agencies involved include the USDA, Commerce, Interior, Labor, State, Transportation and Treasury, as well as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
In February 2003, several major industrial sectors and the membership of the Business Roundtable committed to work with four U.S. agencies (the Department of Energy, EPA, Department of Transportation and Department of Agriculture) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the next decade.
Participating industry sectors include oil and gas production, transportation and refining; electricity generation; coal and mineral production and mining; manufacturing (automobiles, cement, iron and steel, magnesium, aluminum, chemicals and semiconductors); railroads; and forestry products.

In June 2003, the Secretary of Agriculture announced that the Department of Agriculture (USDA) will provide targeted incentives to encourage wider use of land management practices that remove carbon from the atmosphere or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.
Through forest and agriculture conservation programs, such as the Environmental Quality Incentives Program and Conservation Reserve Program, USDA is encouraging the increased use of biomass energy, crop and grazing land conservation actions, practices to reduce emissions from agriculture and sustainable forest management.
For more information, please visit the USDA Press Release on Targeted Incentives for Greenhouse Gas Sequestration .
The factsheet Energy Provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA or Recovery Act) provides information on the tax incentives for both individuals and businesses.
The incentives are designed to spur the use of cleaner, renewable energy and more energy-efficient technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The tax incentives include: an increase in the energy tax credit for homeowners who make energy efficient improvements to their existing homes; credits to purchase for qualified residential alternative energy equipment, such as solar hot water heaters, geothermal heat pumps and wind turbines; and plug-in electric drive vehicles.
The new law also includes increases to new clean renewable energy bonds and qualified energy conservation bonds.
These are just a few of the energy provisions listed.
The EPA web site contains more information on the Recovery Act , especially Clean Diesel .
The term climate change is often used interchangeably with the term global warming, but according to the National Academy of Sciences, "the phrase 'climate change' is growing in preferred use to 'global warming' because it helps convey that there are [other] changes in addition to rising temperatures.
"
natural processes within the climate system (e.g.
changes in ocean circulation);
human activities that change the atmosphere's composition (e.g.
through burning fossil fuels) and the land surface (e.g.
deforestation, reforestation, urbanization, desertification, etc.
)
Global warming is an average increase in the temperature of the atmosphere near the Earth's surface and in the troposphere , which can contribute to changes in global climate patterns.
Global warming can occur from a variety of causes, both natural and human induced.
In common usage, "global warming" often refers to the warming that can occur as a result of increased emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities.
The Earth's climate has changed many times during the planet's history, with events ranging from ice ages to long periods of warmth.
Historically, natural factors such as volcanic eruptions, changes in the Earth's orbit, and the amount of energy released from the Sun have affected the Earth's climate.
Beginning late in the 18th century, human activities associated with the Industrial Revolution have also changed the composition of the atmosphere and therefore very likely are influencing the Earth's climate.
The EPA climate change website has four main sections on climate change issues and another section on "What You Can Do" to reduce your contribution.
A " Frequent Questions " section is available, and EPA has provided a frequent questions database where users can search for more specific questions and answers on climate change.
An eight-page brochure entitled Frequently Asked Questions About Global Warming and Climate Change: Back to Basics (PDF) (8 pp, 1.6MB, About PDF ) provides illustrated answers to frequent questions.
For over the past 200 years, the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, and deforestation have caused the concentrations of heat-trapping "greenhouse gases" to increase significantly in our atmosphere.
These gases prevent heat from escaping to space, somewhat like the glass panels of a greenhouse.
Greenhouse gases are necessary to life as we know it, because they keep the planet's surface warmer than it otherwise would be.
But, as the concentrations of these gases continue to increase in the atmosphere, the Earth's temperature is climbing above past levels.
According to NOAA and NASA data, the Earth's average surface temperature has increased by about 1.2 to 1.4ºF in the last 100 years.
The eight warmest years on record (since 1850) have all occurred since 1998, with the warmest year being 2005.
Most of the warming in recent decades is very likely the result of human activities.
Other aspects of the climate are also changing such as rainfall patterns, snow and ice cover, and sea level.
If greenhouse gases continue to increase, climate models predict that the average temperature at the Earth's surface could increase from 3.2 to 7.2ºF above 1990 levels by the end of this century.
Scientists are certain that human activities are changing the composition of the atmosphere, and that increasing the concentration of greenhouse gases will change the planet's climate.
But they are not sure by how much it will change, at what rate it will change, or what the exact effects will be.
See the Science and Health and Environmental Effects sections of this site for more detail, or review the answers to some frequent science questions .
The Federal government is using voluntary and incentive-based programs to reduce emissions and has established programs to promote climate technology and science.
This strategy incorporates know-how from many federal agencies and harnesses the power of the private sector.
EPA plays a significant role in helping the Federal government reduce greenhouse gas emissions and greenhouse gas intensity.
EPA has many current and near-term initiatives that encourage voluntary reductions from a variety of stakeholders.
Initiatives, such as ENERGY STAR, Climate Leaders, and our Methane Voluntary Programs, encourage emission reductions from large corporations, consumers, industrial and commercial buildings, and many major industrial sectors.
For details on these and other initiatives as well as other aspects of U.S. policy, visit the U.S. Climate Policy section of the site.
In the U.S., our energy-related activities account for over 85 percent of our human-generated greenhouse gas emissions, mostly in the form of carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels.
More than half the energy-related emissions come from large stationary sources such as power plants, while about a third comes from transportation.
Industrial processes (such as the production of cement, steel, and aluminum), agriculture, forestry, other land use, and waste management are also important sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States.
Climate change affects people, plants, and animals.
Scientists are working to better understand future climate change and how the effects will vary by region and over time.
Scientists have observed that some changes are already occurring.
Observed effects include sea level rise, shrinking glaciers, changes in the range and distribution of plants and animals, trees blooming earlier, lengthening of growing seasons, ice on rivers and lakes freezing later and breaking up earlier, and thawing of permafrost.
Another key issue being studied is how societies and the Earth's environment will adapt to or cope with climate change.
In the United States, scientists believe that most areas will to continue to warm, although some will likely warm more than others.
It remains very difficult to predict which parts of the country will become wetter or drier, but scientists generally expect increased precipitation and evaporation, and drier soil in the middle parts of the country.
Northern regions such as Alaska are expected to experience the most warming.
In fact, Alaska has been experiencing significant changes in climate in recent years that may be at least partly related to human caused global climate change.
Human health can be affected directly and indirectly by climate change in part through extreme periods of heat and cold, storms, and climate-sensitive diseases such as malaria, and smog episodes.
For more information on these and other environmental effects, please visit the Health and Environmental Effects section of this site, or review the answers to some frequent effects questions .
Greenhouse gases are emitted as a result of the energy we use by driving and using electricity and through other activities that support our quality of life like growing food and raising livestock.
Greenhouse gas emissions can be minimized through simple measures like changing light bulbs in your home and properly inflating your tires to improve your car's fuel economy.
The What You Can Do section of the climate change site identifies over 25 action steps that individuals can take to decrease greenhouse gas emissions, increase the nation's energy independence and also save money.
Gases that trap heat in the atmosphere are often called greenhouse gases.
This section of the EPA Climate Change Site provides information and data on emissions of greenhouse gases to Earth’s atmosphere, and also the removal of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.
For more information on the science of climate change, please visit EPA's climate change science home page .
Some greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide occur naturally and are emitted to the atmosphere through natural processes and human activities.
Other greenhouse gases (e.g., fluorinated gases) are created and emitted solely through human activities.
The principal greenhouse gases that enter the atmosphere because of human activities are:
Carbon Dioxide (CO2) : Carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere through the burning of fossil fuels (oil, natural gas, and coal), solid waste, trees and wood products, and also as a result of other chemical reactions (e.g., manufacture of cement).
Carbon dioxide is also removed from the atmosphere (or “sequestered”) when it is absorbed by plants as part of the biological carbon cycle.
Fluorinated Gases : Hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride are synthetic, powerful greenhouse gases that are emitted from a variety of industrial processes.
Fluorinated gases are sometimes used as substitutes for ozone-depleting substances (i.e., CFCs, HCFCs, and halons).
These gases are typically emitted in smaller quantities, but because they are potent greenhouse gases, they are sometimes referred to as High Global Warming Potential gases (“High GWP gases”).
A greenhouse gas inventory is an accounting of the amount of greenhouse gases emitted to or removed from the atmosphere over a specific period of time (e.g., one year).
A greenhouse gas inventory also provides information on the activities that cause emissions and removals, as well as background on the methods used to make the calculations.
Policy makers use greenhouse gas inventories to track emission trends, develop strategies and policies and assess progress.
Scientists use greenhouse gas inventories as inputs to atmospheric and economic models.
To track the national trend in emissions and removals since 1990, EPA develops the official U.S. greenhouse gas inventory each year.
The national greenhouse gas inventory is submitted to the United Nations in accordance with the Framework Convention on Climate Change
The Fourth U.S. Climate Action Report concluded, in assessing current trends, thatcarbon dioxide emissions increased by 20 percent from 1990-2004, while methane and nitrous oxide emissions decreased by 10 percent and 2 percent, respectively.
The declines in methane emissions are due to a variety of technological, policy, and agricultural changes, such as increased capture of methane from landfills for energy, reduced emissions from natural gas systems, and declining cattle populations.
At least some of the decline in nitrous oxide emissions is due to improved emissions control technologies in cars, trucks, and other mobile sources.
( Fourth U.S.Climate Action Report, 2007 )
EPA has developed several Climate Leaders Offset Project Methodologies that use a standardized approach to determine project eligibility, address additionality, select and set the baseline, identify monitoring options, and quantify reductions.
This approach seeks to ensure that the GHG emission reductions from offset projects meet four key accounting principles—they must be real, additional, permanent, and verifiable.
In 2009, the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) produced a research report that focuses on the current and future impacts of climate change on the United States.
The report concludes, among other findings, that climate changes in the United States are occurring now and are projected to grow in the future.
These changes will likely place stress on the nation’s water supply and crop productivity, as well as increase risks to human health.
Longer summers and higher temperatures are causing drier conditions, even in the absence of strong trends in precipitation.
Insect outbreaks and wildfires are increasing with warming.
Significant sea-level rise and storm surge will adversely affect coastal cities and ecosystems around the nation; low-lying and subsiding areas are most vulnerable.
Higher water temperatures and ocean acidification due to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide will present major additional stresses to coral reefs, resulting in significant die-offs and limited recovery.
Projected increases in temperature, evaporation, and drought frequency add to concerns about the region’s declining water resources.
Climate change is likely to affect native plant and animal species by altering key habitats such as the wetland ecosystems known as prairie potholes or playa lakes.
Ongoing shifts in the region’s population from rural areas to urban centers will interact with a changing climate, resulting in a variety of consequences.
Island communities, infrastructure, and ecosystems are vulnerable to coastal inundation due to sea-level rise and coastal storms.
Climate changes affecting coastal and marine ecosystems will have major implications for tourism and fisheries.
During the summer, public health and quality of life, especially in cities, will be negatively affected by increasing heat waves, reduced air quality, and increasing insect and waterborne diseases.
In the winter, warming will have mixed impacts.
Significant reductions in Great Lakes water levels, which are projected under higher emissions scenarios, lead to impacts on shipping, infrastructure, beaches, and ecosystems.
The likely increase in precipitation in winter and spring, more heavy downpours, and greater evaporation in summer would lead to more periods of both floods and water deficits.
While the longer growing season provides the potential for increased crop yields, increases in heat waves, floods, droughts, insects, and weeds will present increasing challenges to managing crops, livestock, and forests.
Native species are very likely to face increasing threats from rapidly changing climate conditions, pests, diseases, and invasive species moving in from warmer regions.
Extreme heat and declining air quality are likely to pose increasing problems for human health, especially in urban areas.
Agricultural production, including dairy, fruit, and maple syrup, are likely to be adversely affected as favorable climates shift.
Severe flooding due to sea-level rise and heavy downpours is likely to occur more frequently.
Sea-level rise along vulnerable coastlines will result in increased erosion and the loss of land.
Increased insect outbreaks, wildfires, and changing species composition in forests will pose challenges for ecosystems and the forest products industry.
Sea-level rise and the likely increase in hurricane intensity and associated storm surge will be among the most serious consequences of climate change.
Ecological thresholds are likely to be crossed throughout the region, causing major disruptions to ecosystems and to the benefits they provide to people.
Increasing temperature, drought, wildfire, and invasive species will accelerate transformation of the landscape.
Increased frequency and altered timing of flooding will increase risks to people, ecosystems, and infrastructure.
The commercial industry can go a long way to help the United States bring down its emissions.
This section of EPA's Climate Change site provides examples of the contributions businesses have made towards reducing U.S. emissions; how to educate their industry, consumers, and employees about global warming; and what further steps can be taken to further "lead by example.
"
Businesses can take a lead role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution by implementing actions that save money, improve productivity, protect the environment and increase the nation's energy security.
Leading companies that develop a comprehensive greenhouse gas management strategy and pursue energy efficiency and pollution prevention stand to gain a competitive edge over firms that fail to make these changes.
An increasing number of private firms now see significant opportunities in addressing climate change.
Thousands of companies are profiting from energy efficiency improvements in their facilities and operations.
Thousands more are positioning themselves to be ready for new markets in energy-efficient products and renewable energy technologies.
Leading businesses are taking steps to understand and manage their greenhouse gas emissions by preparing annual greenhouse gas inventories and setting long-term targets to reduce emissions.
EPA's Climate Leaders program provides technical assistance and recognition to U.S. companies that have joined this program.
Business representatives can educate themselves, their customers and their suppliers on the possible effects of future climate change.
Additional and active information sharing will expand the base of ideas, opportunities and solutions for everyone.
Improving energy efficiency not only reduces greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere, it is good for a corporation’s bottom line, as many U.S. businesses face rising energy costs.
Developing and implementing an effective corporate energy management program allows companies to manage energy with the same expertise used to manage other aspects of their business.
ENERGY STAR offers tools and resources to help organizations improve their energy performance.
ENERGY STAR's flagship tool, Portfolio Manager , helps companies establish the current energy use of their buildings, and determine reasonable energy savings goals.
ENERGY STAR also has resources for Small Businesses .
Your organization’s purchased electricity use can be a significant source of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.
Buying green power, a subset of renewable energy, can help reduce your organization’s environmental impact while also providing a number of other valuable benefits.
EPA's Green Power Partnership is a voluntary program that supports the organizational procurement of green power by offering expert advice, technical support, tools and resources.
Leading businesses and corporations are evaluated on many aspects of their performance, including product quality, ethics or standing in the community.
These leaders can provide a powerful example promoting greenhouse gas reduction strategies through corporate incentives such as financial assistance for employees who use public transportation, car-pooling and even telecommuting.
Other "green" practices such as recycling and purchasing recycled materials also contribute to emissions reductions.
Corporate policies involving employees and day-to-day operations can have a positive impact on the climate in and outside the office.
Greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere will increase during the next century unless greenhouse gas emissions decrease substantially from present levels.
Increased greenhouse gas concentrations are very likely to raise the Earth's average temperature, influence precipitation and some storm patterns as well as raise sea levels ( IPCC, 2007 ).
The magnitude of these changes, however, is uncertain.
The amount and speed of future climate change will ultimately depend on:
How strongly features of the climate (e.g.
temperature, precipitation and sea level) respond to changes in greenhouse gas and aerosol concentrations.
How much the climate varies as a result of natural influences (e.g.
from volcanic activity and changes in the sun’s intensity) and its internal variability (referring to random changes in the circulation of the atmosphere and oceans).
Example of future changes in precipitation projected by a general circulation model.
Virtually all published estimates of how the climate could change in the future are produced by computer models of the Earth’s climate system.
These models are known as general circulation models (GCMs).
According to the IPCC (2007) :
“[C]onfidence in models comes from their physical basis, and their skill in representing observed climate and past climate changes.
Models have proven to be extremely important tools for simulating and understanding climate, and there is considerable confidence that they are able to provide credible quantitative estimates of future climate change, particularly at larger scales.
Models continue to have significant limitations, such as in their representation of clouds, which lead to uncertainties in the magnitude and timing, as well as regional details, of predicted climate change.
Nevertheless, over several decades of model development, they have consistently provided a robust and unambiguous picture of significant climate warming in response to increasing greenhouse gases.”
It is important to recognize that projections of climate change in specific areas are not forecasts comparable to tomorrow’s weather forecast.
Rather, they are hypothetical examples of how the climate might change and usually contain a range of possibilities as opposed to one specific high likelihood outcome.
The following pages provide a summary of the projected changes in the atmosphere and climate over the next century based on the current state of knowledge:
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC, 2007 ) concluded that there may be significant regional transitions associated with shifts in forest location and composition in the U.S. due to climate change.
Climate change is likely to alter the geographic distribution of North American forests, including regionally important tree species, such as New England sugar maples and boreal forests in Alaska.
The effects of climate change on forests in the U.S. and other parts of the world will depend not only on climatic factors but also on stresses from pollution (e.g., acid rain); future trends in forest management practices, including fire control and demand for timber; and land-use change.
It is difficult to separate the influence of climate change from these other pressures.
Climate change effects on forests are likely to include changes in forest health and productivity and changes in the geographic range of certain tree species.
These effects can in turn alter timber production, outdoor recreational activities, water quality, wildlife and rates of carbon storage.
In general, forests are sensitive to climatic variability and change.
Climatic factors that influence forest health-temperature, rainfall, atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases and extreme weather and fire events—are changing and are expected to continue changing due to human activities.
The following climate factors are likely to play an important role in determining future forest conditions:
Climatic variability and the frequency and severity of extreme events
Indirect effects on pollution levels such as tropospheric ozone
Changes in temperature and precipitation are expected to change forest location, composition, and productivity.
Climate change is likely to drive the migration of tree species, resulting in changes in the geographic distribution of forest types and new combinations of species within forests.
In North America, many tree species may shift northward or to higher elevations.
( IPCC, 2007 )
) experiments suggest that tree growth rates may increase with increasing levels of atmospheric CO2, but these effects are expected to saturate over time as tree communities adjust to increased CO2 levels.
Climate change effects that influence tree growth will also alter rates of carbon storage (or sequestration) in trees and soils.
Increased carbon sequestration would remove more CO2 from the atmosphere (a negative feedback that lessens climate change), whereas carbon losses through forest disturbances would result in more CO2 entering the atmosphere (a positive feedback that strengthens climate change).
The IPCC ( 2007 ) concludes that “net carbon uptake by terrestrial ecosystems is likely to peak before mid-century and then weaken or even reverse, thus amplifying climate change.”
Changes in forest disturbance regimes, such as fire or disease, could also affect the future of U.S. forests and the market for forest products, such as timber.
Increased temperatures could increase fire risk in areas that become drier due to climate change.
These changes could compound existing fire risks ( IPCC, 2007 ).
Climate change could also promote the rapid increase of diseases and pests that attack tree species.
Such disturbances may be detrimental to forests themselves, but may have a lesser impact at the market level due to salvage operations that harvest timber from dying forests ( Shugart, et al., 2003 ).
Climate change is expected to increase the growth of forests modestly (by 10-20 percent) over the next century.
However, extreme and/or long-term climate change scenarios also create the potential for widespread forest decline.
Disturbances such as wildfires and insect outbreaks are increasing and likely to intensify in a warmer climate with drier soils and longer growing seasons.
The forest fire season is likely to lengthen, and the area subject to high fire danger is likely to increase significantly.

Why do we need another climate change blog?
While most blogs seem to concentrate on the science, this blog will focus on what we can do about it, and indeed what people are already doing about it.
That means I will be concerned with politics, economics, and green technology issues, as well as what you and I as individuals can do right now.
(With the recent change in government in Australia, that country became the 107th country to ratify the treaty, which came into effect in 2005.
There is a very useful Wikipedia entry on the efforts of various countries that ratified the Kyoto Protocol at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol .
)
Yesterday I attended this conference sponsored by The British Consulate General of Houston, The Climate Group, and Shell Oil Company.
I was there for almost 12 hours – ok, the last hour or so was a rather well catered reception – and picked up enough information to fill the blog for weeks.
This will take some time to organize, however, so this is just an introduction.
Yesterday’s event was relatively small, allowing plenty of interaction with the speakers, who included the British Consul, Paul Lynch, and Rick Lazio of JPMorgan Chase and a four-term congressman who ran against Clinton for the senate in 2000.
The keynote speech was given by John Hofmeister, President of Shell Oil Company, and was curiously off-topic.
His concern seems to be reliance on foreign oil rather than climate change, and his solutions have to do with more domestic conventional and unconventional oil and gas development.
This was not received well by any delegate I spoke to, one saying he thought Hofmeister had come to the wrong conference.
There was however a more encouraging presentation from Bill Spence, Vice President of Shell International Renewables.
Overall, the conference was very interesting and very optimistic about our ability to deal with climate change.
Much more to follow.
The statement was made Monday by Daniel Price, President Bush's deputy national security adviser for international economic affairs, at a press conference in Paris.
“An effective framework requires the participation of all major economies, developed and developing alike,” said Mr Price.
“Europe and the US could turn out the lights today, and come 2030 or 2050 we would not have addressed the problem of climate change.”
The US comments stem largely from a process initiated by President Bush last year, rather than in support of the ongoing UN process.
The latter is based upon the IPCC (the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), which last met in Bali last year, and the Kyoto protocol and its replacement due in 2012.
I imagine the US is going his own route to save face after refusing to ratify Kyoto, so I think this will change with the new administration, whoever wins.
In the eleven months Bush has remaining, it is unlikely that much will come from this apparent change in direction.
But at least it might get the dialog with Europe and others on a more constructive basis.
Dan Areily’s new book “Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions” seems to be getting a lot of press lately, having been reviewed in newspapers and Dan having been interviewed on NPR.
It is the subject of a review, written by Elizabeth Kolbert, in this week’s New Yorker.
Ms. Kolbert is the author of “Field Notes from a Catastrophe,” an anecdotal book about climate change (which I recommend by the way), but she does not link the two issues in the review.
When one thinks about the leaders in efforts to combat climate change, the US does not immediately come to mind.
More likely Europe, Japan, or even Costa Rica.
But that could be a misleading impression, based solely upon our federal government and in particular its failure to ratify Kyoto.
This will of course change soon; all the remaining presidential candidates – even Huckabee, who does not believe in evolution -- are supportive of efforts to combat climate change.
As reported by Reuters and AP, last week saw a UN summit where institutional investors pledged to invest $10bn over the next two years in technologies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
The plan "reflects the many investment opportunities that exist today to put a dent in global warming pollution, build profits and benefit the global economy," said Mindy Lubber, the president of Ceres, a coalition of investors and environmental leaders, and director of the Investor Network on Climate Risk.
Lubber called it the largest meeting of financial leaders ever to focus on climate change and said it would illustrate how the marketplace is starting to transform.
Never ceases to amaze me, but whenever I blog something I read something new within hours which changes my view.
Yesterday I said to look for hydrogen and electric for final solution on powering cars.
Then, over lunch, I finally got around to reading Tuesday’s papers, and the NYT Science Times section reports a proposal out of Los Alamos national lab to produce synthetic gasoline from the CO2 in the atmosphere.
Of course this addresses the fuel problem rather elegantly, but it does not address the energy problem.
The energy to do this still needs to come from somewhere, probably a power station.
In this it is no different from electric or hydrogen cars.
The big advantage however is that no change is required to our cars or to the gas stations we rely upon.
Seems like a win-win to me.
There are a number of ethical questions surrounding climate change, not least those to do with the fact that many of the people expected to be most affected contribute little or nothing to greenhouse gas emissions because they live in poor countries or are not even born yet.
But this post concerns a particular question posed by a comment to my February 6th post, namely: does wealth entitle one to create more greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions?
(Actually the comment said CO2, but I am generalizing to GHG.
) This got me thinking, which is always dangerous and in this case is probably going to be contentious.
The rights that are given, as implied by an entitlement, tend to be the rights to certain kinds of wellbeing, typically goods and services.
One might think everyone is entitled to free health care or clean drinking water, for example.
Attitudes vary around the world: most western countries regard free health care as a right.
The US does not, but it does regard free education as a right.
China is meant to be a communist country but provides neither health care nor education free.
Which brings me to the contrast between these kinds of rights and the rights guaranteed by the constitution.
A more controversial example of the latter would be the second amendment right to bear arms.
This has been interpreted as meaning that every citizen has the right to own a gun, but not even the NRA thinks it means the government should provide them free.
Likewise, merely proclaiming the right to free health care would not in itself make it happen; it would just mean free health care could not be made illegal.
The point is that the right to a particular good or service has to be granted by someone, and so implies an obligation or duty on that person to provide it.
If the government thinks everyone should have clean drinking water, they have the duty to legislate so as to somehow provide it.
Quality wine depends upon a lot of factors but not least the climate, indeed the best wines depend upon the microclimate on particular hillsides.
So it is not surprising that wine growers are concerned about climate change.
They held a conference in Barcelona last week, and I will get to that later, before ending with a note on a report about wine’s carbon footprint.
But first a couple of anecdotes:
The drought in Australia has been so bad that Australian wine makers do not have enough grapes to satisfy demand.
For example, Lindemans is sourcing wine from Chile and South Africa.
And now to the conference in Barcelona, where Al Gore is giving the closing address just about now as I prepare this on Saturday 16th.
Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports that the Second International Congress on Wine and Climate Change has attracted more than 350 experts from 36 countries.
(But apparently for some reason not many from Spain and none at all from Rioja; Catalonian/Basque rivalry maybe?
)
The conference began on Friday when Bernard Seguin, head of climate studies at France's INRA agricultural research institute, told delegates that the consequences of global warming are already being felt, adding “Harvests are already coming 10 days earlier than before in almost all wine-growing regions.
"
"Wine and wine-producing will change in a way that will depend on how we confront global warming,” said Seguin.
"If the temperature rises two or three degrees (centigrade), we could manage to see Bordeaux remain as Bordeaux, Rioja as Rioja, Burgundy as Burgundy.
But if it goes up five or six degrees, we must face up to huge problems, and the changes will be hard.
"
The French "Grand Crus" could be further threatened by the "New World" wines of Australia, California, Chile, Argentina, South Africa and New Zealand, who would have the best climatic conditions.
"The countries in the southern hemisphere are next to a greater mass of water, and it is sea currents which maintain the temperature at its level," said Campos.
This is all very speculative in my opinion, because we do not really know how the global rise in temperature will affect individual climates around the world.
All we can say for sure is that the wine map of the world will change.
Some areas may get better, some worse, while others may adapt their techniques and the varieties they grow.
We may see Cabernet and Merlot growing in Burgundy instead of Pinot, though of course this would require changing French wine law.
A while back I posted about my personal experiences with compact florescent lamps, as a result of which a reader emailed me to warn me of their dangers.
All fluorescents contain Mercury, the most toxic non-radioactive metal known to man.
It is a neurotoxin and especially dangerous for young children.
There is no effective way to clean up after an indoor breakage.
Furthermore, there is no effective recycling program.
Apparently California may require big bold labels stating CFLs are toxic.
Still like your sprawling ranch, or maybe can’t get out because of negative equity?
In coming weeks I will talk about what you can do to make wherever you live more efficient, starting next Saturday with a couple of gadgets that have helped me reduce my electricity consumption by 25% over the past year or so.
Plus an update on my sole LED lamp, which is now consigned to the scrap heap.
Once again, late breaking news trounces what I had prepared for today.
According to the Financial Times yesterday, McKinsey was set to release a report about the cost of addressing climate change, and the man conclusion is that about half of the required reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions could actually be achieved at a profit.
I have not been able to find this report yet on the web, but it seems to be a follow-up to the report they issued last November, prior to the Bali conference.
(See http://mckinsey.com/clientservice/ccsi/greenhousegas.asp for a summary and the ability to download the full report, an executive summary, video or slideshow presentation.
)
The good news is that McKinsey believes that about half the reductions in greenhouse gas GHG required to meet the IPCC goal of stabilizing GHG atmospheric concentration at 550 ppm not only can be achieved by energy savings using existing technology, but that it can be done at a profit (with an average return of 17%).
That would suggest to me that the other half would probably be achievable and profitable with the imposition of a relatively low carbon tax or the equivalent, especially when measures other than energy efficiency are included.
The bad news is that we are apparently not doing it.
That is to say, we are not acting in our own economic interest.
Adam Smith’s invisible hand is not working.
I wonder why?
One explanation is that this conclusion must be quite sensitive to the price of fossil fuels, and these have only recently reached the dizzying heights they are today.
Other reasons, especially among individuals and small companies, probably include ignorance, apathy, and an inability to make the necessary capital investment.
I have also found personally that companies often look for unrealistic rates of return, often expecting a payback period of 2 years.
I do not understand why this is; where can they invest and get a 50% return?
(For insights into how big business regards climate change issues, see another McKinsey report “How Companies Think about Climate Change,” which indicates that climate change issues are considered mostly with regard to the effect on a company's brands and reputation.

In what could be a U.S. first, California’s Bay Area Air Quality Management District is proposing to charge an annual fee to businesses based on emissions, the Mercury News reports .
All 10,000 “stationary sources” of air pollution that the air district regulates would be subject to the fee, 4.2 cents per metric ton of carbon dioxide, including businesses and government agencies.. The Shell oil refinery in Martinez would pay the largest fee, $186,475 a year for its 4.4 million annual metric tons of emissions.
The air district’s board could take a final vote by May.
The fee seems ridiculously small.
By contrast, FT reported yesterday that in evalulating investment decision US companies were planning on future legislation imposing a charge of betweeen $13 and $40 a metric ton.
That's more like it, and within the $10 to $50 range suggested in my post of February 8.
The report also noted that this congress had introduced 125 pieces of legislation addressing climate change.
Meanwhile, at the Cambridge Energy Reasearch Associate's conference here in Houston this week, Jim Mulva (CEO of ConocoPhillips) in a keynote address warned that the US risks the loss of geopolitical influence and "incalculable damage" to its efforts to fight terrorism and encourage trade due to its opposition to worldwide action on climate change.
I would have said that had already happened.
"If 2007 was the year when climate change rose to the top of the global agenda, 2008 is the time we must take concerted action," according to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, as reported by Associated Press.
Ban was speaking yesterday at the beginning of a two-day U.N. General Assembly debate to generate support for a new treaty by 2009 to fight global warming.
Michael Bloomberg, the keynote speaker and New York's climate-activist mayor, called on the United States to set "real and binding" targets to reduce the greenhouse gases blamed for warming the planet, in contrast to the current U.S. strategy that largely relies on voluntary approaches and spending for research and technology.
"I believe that the American people are prepared for our responsibility to lead by example," he said.
NPR reported today that Costa Rica’s aim to become the first carbon neutral country might be at risk due to the effects of climate change itself.
The country produces nearly 80% of its electricity from Hydroelectric plants (and another 18% from wind and geothermal sources) and even a tiny shift in rainfall patterns could leave the country without enough water to meet its growing demand for electricity.
Of course, nobody knows exactly what the specific local effects of climate change will be, but scientists think it is likely to have a significant effect on rainfall.
A short post today about recent mild winters in England.
Far be it from me to relate this directly to climate change, but some people seem more swayed by anecdotal 'evidence' than the science.
Now, well actually last week, Reuters reports similar concern over tortoises coming out of hibernation too early.
Owners are advised to put them in the refrigerator, making sure you open it once a day to get some air in.
See http://uk.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUKL0682389820080206 for full story.
Anthropogenic global warming skeptics are fond of pointing out that a lot of greenhouse gas emissions come from animals (in the form of methane) and suggest that this “natural” effect is not anthropogenic.
But a lot of the animals involved are livestock for human consumption.
An interesting article in the New York Times on January 27th points out that Americans alone eat nearly 10 billion animals a year.
Worldwide we ate about 284 million tons in 2007, up about 300% from 1961, and this is expected to increase double by 2050.
Then there is the problem of deforestation in places like Brazil to make room for cattle.
30% of the earth’s ice-free land is involved in livestock production.
But yesterday there was news of two new studies published online in Science magazine which take all this into account and concludes that the overall effect of corn ethanol production is actually counterproductive, i.e.
it adds about twice as much GHG to the atmosphere than using gasoline.
The food taken out of the supply system for ethanol production needs to get replaced, and the way it gets replaced is largely by deforestation.
Before we get into that, we need to talk about units.
GHG emissions are normally measured in CO2 equivalents, but some people quote the price per tonne (a.k.a.
metric ton) of carbon and some per tonne of carbon dioxide.
1 tonne of CO2 contains about 0.27 tonnes of carbon.
Also, estimates may be in different currencies, so I have converted all to US$ per tonne of CO2.
(“US$/tCO2”) I have used approximate exchange rates: 2 US$ to the pound sterling, 1.5 US$ to the euro, and 1.25 NZ$ to the US$.
The best-known cap-and-trade system is the European Union’s Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) which started in 2005 on a trial basis and became fully operational at the beginning of 2008 when the Kyoto commitment period started.
It covers industries like power generation, iron and steel, glass and cement which between them accounted for about 40% of the CO2 emissions of the EU’s 25 member states at the time.
The EU is required by the Kyoto Protocol to cut its emissions by 8% from 1990 levels by 2012.
Estimates of the actual cost of climate change are not surprisingly all over the lot.
A 2004 meta-study by Richard Tol analyzed 103 estimates from 28 published studies, yielding estimates from slightly negative (because some people benefit from climate change) to US$450/tCO2.
The median value was US$4/tCO2 and Tol concludes that the cost – and therefore any tax -- is unlikely to exceed US$13.5tCO2.
(All these values converted from US$/tC.
)
The Stern Review, commissioned by the UK government and issued in 2006, is perhaps the most comprehensive attempt to estimate the cost of unabated climate change.
It came up with a higher value, largely because of the use of a lower social discount rate and equity weighting as discussed last week.
It estimated the cost of doing nothing to be about US$85/tCO2, while the cost of reducing emissions was only about US$25/tCO2.
(For the key findings, see http://politics.guardian.co.uk/economics/story/0,,1935208,00.html .
) In 2007, The UK government’s environmental agency, DEFRA, adopted a social cost of US$50/tCO2 to be used in all cost-benefit analyses of public projects.
A gallon of gasoline generates about 20 pounds of carbon dioxide.
A tonne is about 2200 pounds, so that is less than one hundredth of a tonne.
The tax would therefore amount to only about 10 to 50 cents per gallon.
With gasoline at $3, that would be an increase of between 3% and 17%.
Reuters reported the other day that Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley have adopted “The Carbon Principles,” climate change guidelines for advisors and lenders to power companies in the U.S. The banks say the move is in anticipation of the government capping GHG emissions in the coming years and that the biggest motivation for it was financial.
The new standards are the result of nine months of negotiations among the banks, environmental groups, and large utilities.
The principles were developed in consultation with power companies American Electric Power, CMS Energy, DTE Energy, NRG Energy, PSEG, Sempra and Southern Company.
Environmental Defense and the Natural Resources Defense Council were also involved.
The standards do not preclude bank financing for building traditional coal-burning power plants, but they do set up a more rigorous evaluation process.
“A rational set of carbon principles to help guide energy investment strategy is vital to our nation’s energy and economic future,” said Michael G. Morris, Chairman, president and CEO of American Electric Power, “Recognizing that energy efficiency, renewables, cleaner fossil technologies and other diverse solutions all have significant roles in addressing climate challenges while maintaining economic and energy security establishes a framework for making the best decisions regarding our nation’s energy future.”
Conventional and advanced generation: In addition to cost effective energy efficiency, renewables and low carbon distributed generation, investments in conventional or advanced generating facilities will be needed to supply reliable electric power to the US market.
This may include power from natural gas, coal and nuclear technologies.
Due to evolving climate policy, investing in CO2-emitting fossil fuel generation entails uncertain financial, regulatory and certain environmental liability risks.
It is the purpose of the Enhanced Diligence process to assess and reflect these risks in the financing considerations for certain fossil fuel generation.
We will encourage regulatory and legislative changes that facilitate carbon capture and storage (CCS) to further reduce CO2 emissions from the electric sector.
I have just posted today's installment of what I plan to make a regular Wednesday car post, but I need to say something about the Super Tuesday result.
We can now be sure that the next president will be serious about climate change.
I always thought that McCain was the only Republican with a shot at winning the general election.
If he does so, his conservative credentials may actually make it easier for him to deliver than it would be for a Democrat, rather like Nixon going to China.
Maybe John Adams will write an opera about it one day!
Wednesday is going to be car day on the blog, and it’s time for a confession.
I am a car guy, which does not sit well with concern for climate change but that’s the way it is.
About 6 times a year I get into a vintage MGB race car and race other enthusiasts around a road course, burning up maybe 15 gallons of high octane fuel.
What’s more, my daily driver is a Mazda RX7 which I bought new 16 years ago and which gets about 17mpg.
If Dustin Hoffman’s film the Graduate was set today, the one word Mr. McGuire says to Ben would be “nanotechnology” rather than “plastics.” Nanotechnology has potential applications in fields as varied as cancer treatment and new materials for aircraft manufacture, as well as a number of interesting possibilities for combating climate change.
This is a quick review of some of these possibilities, following a nanotechnology conference I attended a week or so ago.
I will try to come back to some of them in more detail in later postings.
Nanotechnology is the science of very small particles, from 1 to 10 nanometers, a nanometer being an American billionth (10 to the power -9) of a meter.
These have interesting properties because this is small enough for quantum mechanical effects to emerge and also because the ratio of surface area to volume gets greater as the size of the particles gets smaller.
Both these aspects of nanotechnology present exciting possibilities in the fight against climate change.
Like some political debate, conventional incandescent light bulbs produce more heat than light.
In fact, only about 2% of the energy they use is emitted as light, which is why lighting is seen as “low hanging fruit” for energy conservation and why the US and other governments have legislated to phase these bulbs out.
(Actually, the legislation does not ban incandescent bulbs explicitly, but mandates a minimum efficiency of about 20 lumens per watt.
Current incandescents typically produce less than 15, while compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) easily beat the proposed standard at up to 70 lumens per watt.
) There are other alternatives, and in a later posting I hope to discuss the physics behind them, but today I am going to report my own experiences using CFLs and hope to get feedback.
(In fact, I plan to concentrate my Saturday postings on the practical aspects of what individuals can do to reduce climate change.
)
Most of the bulbs in the house come from Bright Effects, which I think belongs to Lowes.
One is a regular 15W bulb (LBP16AM2) which is fine.
Most are large 18W floodlights (LBP18R402) in can fixtures, and have also operated flawlessly so far (getting on for a year).
However, I bought four smaller 15W floods (LPB15R30M2) which were mounted in more confining fixtures and which failed within 3 to 6 months.
Lowes refused to replace them or refund the money, saying that they do not refund on light bubs.
I think they need to rethink this policy for CFLs.
All in all I think it is well worth making the switch to CFL, at least if you live in a hot climate; I live in Houston where we use A/C most of the year so producing less heat gives a double benefit and in my case it has contributed to a 25% drop in my electricity bills.
(There is no real advantage at times when you are heating the space anyway, especially if heating with electricity.
) The biggest problem seems to be failure of the ballast when confined in a can fixture, but some cans seem to provide more space than others.
I should perhaps add the obvious fact that this is all highly unscientific and anecdotal.
I welcome comments from others on their experiences with CFLs.
But how to determine the appropriate price?
There are two basic ways of looking at it: either we can try to calculate the cost of the damage done by the emissions; or else we can decide that we need to set a firm limit on GHG concentration in the atmosphere and then try to set prices in such a way that this is achieved.
I will elaborate on each of these, but note that to have any effect the price charged needs to be more than the cost of reducing emissions, at least in some applications.
This cost will vary according to circumstances both within and between industries, and the price mechanism will encourage the reduction of emissions in those places where it can be done most economically, while concentrating the remaining emissions in those industries where it is hardest to change.
(For example, it is easier to build clean new power stations and to retrofit old ones.
)
Firstly, the adverse effects of climate change seem to bear more heavily on the poorest countries.
Sub-Saharan Africa is likely to see worse droughts, while much of Bangladesh and all the Maldives may be under water.
Meanwhile Canada expects to benefit from an open Northwest passage, Russia will see better agricultural conditions, and prestigious Champagne houses are already considering planting in England.
Counting the cost in dollars using current exchange rates does not adequately reflect the suffering of third world countries.
Is the loss of a peasant’s house worth less to him than the loss of a tycoon’s mansion?
Secondly, if we do nothing the adverse effects of climate change will build up for ever.
Using normal discount rates to discount the far future effectively disenfranchises our grandchildren.
We may prefer to spend $1 now rather than $1.05 next year, but can we extrapolate this time preference to conclude that we have the right to spend a $1 now and deprive our grandchildren of $50 eighty years hence?
(1.05 to the power 80 is about 50.

Climate change and outdoor recreation: Part 2
In Part 1 I reviewed the scant U.S. literature (another two papers have been sent to me since then, thanks!
) and in Part 2 I'm looking at the effects of temperature and precipitation on recreation participation in three sectors: boating, freshwater fishing and hunting.
I'm analyzing the factors that affect participation in each of these activities including family income (income), race (white=1), sex (male=1), age (age), education (educ), household size (hhnum), children under 6 (under6), urban resident (metro), average state temperature in January (jantemp) and July (jultemp), January precipitation (janpcp) and July precipitation (julpcp).
Temperature and precipitation data is obtained from NOAA*.
The idea, not mine (see part 1 ), is to obtain an estimate of the effect of climate on participation across the U.S. and use this relationship to forecast changes in behavior as climate changes.
The estimate of the effect of climate on participation across the U.S. is obtained using the linear probability model (logistic regression obtains the same results but the simulations are more difficult with a nonlinear model; hey, this is a stupid blog ... give me a break) plus " business intelligence software " and a desktop computer.
At first glance, regression results ( Download Table ) indicate that climate has uncertain effects on recreation participation in boating, freshwater fishing and hunting:
For boating, increases in July temperature will decrease participation.
January temperature has no effect.
Increases in precipitation will increase participation.
For freshwater fishing, temperature has no effect on participation.
Increases in January precipitation will decrease participation while increases in July precipitation will increase participation.
For hunting, increases in temperature will have no effect on participation.
Increases in January precipitation will decrease participation while increases in July precipitation will increase participation.
Since climate change is expected to increase temperature and precipitation in the U.S. the net effect of climate change on recreation participation is not clear.
To determine the overall impacts I simulated the effects of the change in temperature and precipitation on the overall recreation participation levels with U.S. average temperature [ pdf ] and precipitation [ pdf ] forecasts (developed by Ben Poulter of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Change Research ... Thanks Ben!
).
Participation rates in 2098 with climate change (holding income constant) are:
In contrast to previous studies, I'm finding that climate change decreases boating and hunting participation with no effect on freshwater fishing.
If I was really serious about this I'd need to dig further but it does bring into question the aggregate data national estimates from a few years ago ( Part 1 ).
Just for fun, how about if we simulate income increases on top of climate change?
Suppose that incomes double from 2000 to 2098 (a 0.72% real growth rate [this is conservative]).
Participation rates in 2098 with climate change and a doubling of income are:
The change in participation rates from 2000 to 2098 with climate change and a doubling of income are:
I'd appreciate any comments on this analysis.
Looking ahead, part 3 will consider the effects of temperature and precipitation on the intensity of participation (days, not just yes or no) for skiing, camping, saltwater fishing, beach going, and wildlife watching.
The data is in text format.
Documentation is in readme file: state.README.
The temperature and precipitation data are drd964x.tmpst.txt and drd964x.pcpst.txt.

Climate change and outdoor recreation: Part 1
I've been working on a paper looking at the impact of climate change-induced sea level rise on shore fishing in North Carolina (the working paper will be out in a month or two, I think).
The impacts are negative but this holds other climate change variables, temperature and precipitation, constant.
I've been looking into these impacts so my co-authors and I don't look totally foolish.
In part 1 of a(n), at least, 3 part series, here is the literature review (part 2 will have some empirical results, part 3 will have some welfare impacts).
I've found 3 US-based studies on climate change and outdoor recreation.
Each of these finds positive impacts of climate change on the outdoor recreational sector of the US economy.
Past research on the impact of climate change on outdoor recreational activities in the United States is sparse.
Early studies find that precipitation and temperature impacts beach recreation activities (McConnell, 1977, Silberman and Klock, 1988).
More recently, Englin and Moeltner (2004) find that temperature and precipitation affects the number of skiing and snowboarding days in expected ways.
Two studies have related the effects of temperature and precipitation on outdoor recreation activities and used these results to model the impacts on WTP of climate change.
This research finds that the impacts of climate change on outdoor recreation will be positive.
Mendelsohn and Markowsi (1999) consider the effects of changes in temperature and rainfall on boating, camping, fishing, hunting, skiing and wildlife viewing using statewide aggregate demand functions.
Considering a range of climate scenarios, the authors find that increased temperature and precipitation increases the aggregate WTP of hunting, freshwater fishing and boating and decreases the aggregate WTP of camping, skiing and wildlife viewing.
The net impacts of climate change on aggregate WTP are positive.
Loomis and Crespi (1999) take an approach similar to Mendelsohn and Markowsi (1999) but use different sources and more disaggregate data.
They consider the effects of temperature and precipitation on beach recreation, reservoir recreation, stream recreation, downhill and cross-country skiing, waterfowl hunting, bird viewing and forest recreation.
Overall, they find that climate change will have positive impacts on the aggregate WTP of outdoor recreation activities.
In particular, they consider the impacts of sea level rise on beach recreation and waterfowl hunting.
For beach recreation they use the positive relationship between beach length and the number of beach days per month to assess the loss of beaches.
The joint effects of increased temperature, increased precipitation and beach loss leads to a positive economic impact.
For waterfowl hunting they use the relationship between wetland acres and waterfowl hunting participation and find a negative economic impact with sea level rise.
In contrast to the previous studies, Richardson and Loomis (2004) employ a stated preference approach to estimate the impacts of climate change on WTP for recreation at Rocky Mountain National Park.
Stated preference surveys ask outdoor recreation participants for their willingness to pay for climate change or for their hypothetical changes in visitation behavior with changes in climate.
Richardson and Loomis’ hypothetical scenario explicitly considers the direct effects of climate, temperature and precipitation, and the indirect effects of temperature and precipitation on other environmental factors such as vegetation composition and wildlife populations.
Using visitor data, they find that climate would have positive impacts on visitation at the Rocky Mountain National Park.

The US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) has reported annual trends of air quality and acid rain data.
Both sets of data show that air quality improvements are occurring despite increases in vehicle distance travelled and energy consumption.
The report Latest Findings on National Air Quality: 2002 Status and Trends, shows that the six main pollutants: - carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, sulphur dioxide and particulate matter, have been cut by 48% since 1970.
The EPA expect air quality to improve even more over coming years due to the introduction of Clear Skies Act, which calls for a 70% reduction in sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and mercury.
However, critics claim that cleaner air could be achieved by enforcing the current clean air act, holding polluters responsible for the damage they do, and investing in environmental technology and renewable energy sources.
A report by the UK Commission for Integrated Transport (CIFT) has called for major increases to air operators and their customers, to make the aviation industry more sustainable and responsible and to operate the principles of 'the polluter pays'.
The CIFT allege that airlines are responsible for far more pollution than they are held accountable for.
Chairman of the CIFT, Professor David Begg, states that "Airports have a huge impact on the communities they serve as well as on the environment at large and we need to make sure that, in a world of growing demand, environmental impact is kept to a manageable minimum.
What we are proposing is nothing short of a radical reform to make operators and passengers confront the environmental consequences of their actions.
"
The CIFT report highlights the rapid growth of air passengers in the UK over the past 20 years, from 50 million to 162 million, which has largely been a result of falling airfares.
At present, Aviation Passenger Duty raises around half of the £1.4 billion costs of climate change emissions which the aviation industry are responsible for in the UK.
Reductions in the levels of sulphur and nitrogen in European forests have led to a recovery in damaged trees.
Scientists, however, have stressed the need for further emissions cuts to address remaining air pollution problems.
The latest report from the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe on European forest conditions highlights the benefits of reduced emissions, but reports that a fifth of the trees studied were damaged.
A high percentage of trees still have damaged crowns.
Scientists took samples from 7,000 observation points across 36 European countries.
Southern Europe was affected by high concentrations of ozone; ozone injury was found to be visible on the leaves of beech trees and some ground vegetation species that had not previously been known to be ozone sensitive.
Emission reductions from countries like the Soviet Union are likely to be the result of lower production levels.
Scientists therefore emphasize that cleaner production technologies should be encouraged.
STROKE RISK MAY BE LINKED TO AIR POLLUTION
Researchers in Taiwan have found that at times of high air pollution, hospital admissions increased.
The increase in admissions seems to correlate well with high levels of nitrogen dioxide and particulate pollution.
In hot weather, when temperatures were greater than 20°C the problem seemed to be worse according to the scientists.
Previous research studies have shown a link between air pollution and death rates from respiratory and heart disease but there has been no clear link with air pollution and strokes.
The research in Taiwan involved data from more than 23,000 hospital admissions from 1997 to 2000 in Kaohsiung, Taiwan's second city, an area of heavy industry.
Air pollution levels on the dates of admissions were compared with air pollution levels one week before and one week after admissions to hospital.
A rise in levels of both pollutants was linked to a significant increase in the number of people admitted to hospital with either of the most common type of stroke - one caused by a burst blood vessel in the brain, the other by a clot blocking blood flow to the brain.
The research suggests that the higher the pollutant level, the greater the risk of both types of stroke.
It is thought amongst experts that air pollution makes the blood stickier, making it tougher for the heart to pump it round the body.
This is thought to increase the risk of blood clotting and damage to the blood vessels.
According to a study commissioned by the Association of British Insurers (ABI), building insurance premiums could soar in Britain and particularly in London and the South-East in the coming years unless more is done to defend homes from storm damage.
Climate change is expected to push wind speeds in the South of England up by as much as 10% and dramatically increase the frequency of major storms.
An average of 200,000 UK homes a year suffer wind damage, more than those affected by flooding.
Property insurance claims were £2.1bn after the storms of 1990 and the average bill from weather-related damage has risen to £825m a year in the past decade.
The ABI report reveals that London and its surrounding area are most at risk in the future due to the high percentage of older properties and the fact that depression tracts are due to shift south from the North Atlantic.
Storms this time last year, which brought gusts of 70 mph to the capital, caused insured losses of more than £150m.
Globally since 1987, storms have caused $8.1bn (£4.8bn) more insured losses a year than flooding.
The idea that there is no need to worry about human-induced global warming because the world's climate in medieval time was at least as warm as today's is flawed, according to a recent analysis reported in the journal Science.
"Climate in Medieval Time," by Raymond S. Bradley of the University of Massachusetts - Amherst, Malcolm K. Hughes of the University of Arizona Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research, and Henry F. Diaz of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Office of Atmospheric Research suggests that there is not enough evidence to conclude that the Medieval Warm Period was global, or that regional warm spells between 500 and 1500 A.D. occurred simultaneously.
To reconstruct climate, scientists use natural archives, including tree rings, ice cores and laminated sediments.
These natural records of temperature, precipitation and other environmental history have been carefully calibrated with instrumental observations, giving scientists quantitative information on past conditions at particular locations.
Unfortunately, most of these records come from the temperate zones in the Northern Hemisphere.
Few come from the tropics, and only a handful come from the Southern Hemisphere.
A common argument for the existence of a global Medieval Warm Period is that the amount of solar radiation hitting Earth's atmosphere was as high in medieval time as in the 20th century.
The corollary, therefore, is that the 20th century global warming has been largely driven by the sun, not by higher concentrations of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
However, increases in solar radiation do not warm Earth's surface at all locations.
Rather, ozone absorbs ultraviolet radiation, warming the stratosphere and altering atmospheric circulation patterns.
The influence on tropospheric and surface temperature is complex and there is no obvious relationship between solar irradiance and global average surface temperature.
Frequent volcanic eruptions from 1100 to 1260 A.D. may have added to the regional variation.
Volcanic eruptions may have resulted in mild winters in northern and western Europe during High Medieval time.
A NASA study published in the American Meteorological Society's Journal of Climate warns that the rate of warming in the Arctic is speeding up and may affect the whole planet in complex ways which are not yet understood.
According to the research, the rate of warming in the Arctic over the last 20 years is eight times greater than the rate over the entire last 100 years.
Temperatures are increasing at an average of 1.22°C per decade over most of the Arctic, although some areas, including Greenland, are actually cooling.
Summer ice cover in the Arctic has also been declining at a rate of 9% per decade and is close to the record low set last year.
Hospital admissions rose rapidly.
Most of those that died were already sufferers of cardiovascular or respiratory diseases.
The combined effects of the fog and smoke particles from coal burning aggravated the conditions of those prone to such illnesses, causing more than 4000 to die during the 4 day smog.
As a result of the famous smog, new laws were introduced which led to a dramatic cut in levels of smoke and sulphur dioxide levels in subsequent years.
However, air pollution in London remains a problem mainly due to the large volumes of traffic within the city.
The government targets for nitrogen dioxide and fine particles are expected to be exceeded along major road networks, around Heathrow and in central London.
The National Society for Clean Air & Environmental Protection marked the anniversary of the London Smog with the publication of The Clean Air Revolution: 1952-2052.
European Union Transport Ministers have made an agreement to try and improve their co-ordination of air space in the interests of safety, reducing delays and cutting air pollution.
Creating a more unified airspace would help streamline safety procedures, and save fuel by allowing aircraft to fly in straight lines rather than zig-zagging around areas managed by different authorities.
Professor Roy Harrison, a leading expert on air pollution and member of two government air pollution committees, has suggested that one in ten deaths from lung cancer in the UK may be linked to particulate pollution (PM2.5).
Harrison bases his claim on US research which strongly links fine particulate air pollution from vehicles and industry with cancer.
Lung cancer has normally been associated with smoking.
Some scientists feel that the focus on smoking has led to the health effect to the population by air pollution being overlooked.
The plans to review and update individual pollutants for the Air Quality Strategy are to be scrapped.
Rupert Furness from DEFRA pointed out that the complexity of the particles objective had become such that only air pollution experts could understand it.
The annual bonfire celebrations throughout the UK failed to cause high levels of particle pollution this year.
The highest recorded PM10 reading was in North London at 135mg/m3, whereas last year the highest PM10 measurement was 750mg/m3, in Bexley.
The weather conditions around November 5th 2002 were generally wet and windy, allowing pollutants to be dispersed readily.
Only a few sites around the UK entered the moderate air pollution category and Brent was the only site to be in the high and very high category.
According to researchers at the Woods Hole Institute in Massachusetts, US, the six largest Eurasian rivers are feeding elevated quantities of freshwater into the Arctic Ocean now than they were several decades ago.
Their finding seems to support the long-held prediction that freshwater runoff into the Arctic would increase as a result of global warming.
Between 1936 and 1999 a 7% increase in runoff has been observed.
In addition to increased rates of precipitation, changes in ice and permafrost melt or changes in the seasonality of precipitation and runoff, may have influenced this trend.
If this current rate of freshwater influx into the Artic Ocean continues to rise, it could have a large-scale impact on ocean circulation patterns in the North Atlantic.
By reducing the density of the usually cold saline water in this part of the world, the influx could slow down or shut off the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) formation, the driving factor behind a global ocean circulation, which brings large amounts of warm water to the North Atlantic region via the Gulf Stream.
Paradoxically, this could result in a cooling of northern Europe by several degrees, particularly in winter.
Certainly evidence from the past confirms that rapid changes in ocean circulation in the North Atlantic can have far-reaching impacts on the global climate in only a matter of decades.
Last month, Canada officially signed the Kyoto Protocol, the international agreement seeking to reduce greenhouse gas.
Under the terms of the Protocol, Canada is committed to lowering greenhouse-gas emissions by 6% below 1990 rates by 2012, a cut of 20 to 30% from current levels.
While environmental groups praise Canada's action, industry groups and some politicians fear Kyoto will cost billions of dollars and thousands of jobs.
Nevertheless, a study conducted for the government suggests that Canada's economy will grow by about 16% by 2010 with Kyoto implementation, compared to 18% under a business-as-usual scenario.
There could also be benefits from cleaner energy investment, such as lower pollution-related health costs, it says.
New Zealand has also ratified the Protocol, despite accounting for only 0.2% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions.
In an effort to achieve its Kyoto Protocol targets New Zealand Government has proposed introducing a new carbon emissions tax, building upon a waste strategy launched earlier in 2002.
To date more than 95 countries have ratified the Kyoto Protocol, including the entire European Union and Japan.
The Environment in your Pocket includes more than 50 key data series covering: the global atmosphere, air quality, inland water quality and use, coastal and marine waters, radioactivity, noise, waste and recycling, land use and land cover, and wildlife.
Included among the key series are all the environmental headline indicators of sustainable development.
Also included are some key results from the survey of public attitudes to quality of life and to the environment, conducted 2001.
UK emissions of all the main air pollutants have fallen since 1980;
An estimated £4.2 billion was spent by UK industry to reduce environmental pollution in 2000.
The Environment Minister, Michael Meacher has announced a number of tougher targets to update the Air Quality Strategy.
The pollutants which are to be included are particulates (PM10), carbon monoxide and benzene with the addition of a new standard for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).
In addition, the PM10 annual objective, is to be halved to 20 µg/m3, whilst London is to achieve 23 µg/m3.
The reason that London has slightly less stringent targets is that London currently has much higher levels of pollution compared with the rest of the UK.
The Government feels that the challenge to meet these new targets will be equally as great for London as elsewhere in the UK.
The new targets for particulates follow advice from the Committee on Medical Effects of Air Pollution (COMEAP), who reported in May 2001 on the long term health effects of particles.
Particles are associated with a range of short-term health effects, including effects on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, asthma and death.
COMEAP suggest that long-term exposure to particles increases premature death, particularly from heart disease.
COMEAP estimates that the long-term effect of exposure to particulates has a much greater (around ten times) effect on life expectancy than short-term exposure.
In particular, the Committee suggest that reducing long-term exposure to particulates to those susceptible to air pollution such as children and the elderly could increase life expectancy by several months.
The Bush administration in the US has announced that air pollution emissions legislation will be relaxed for old power stations when they are to be repaired or expanded.
The GAO compared emissions from old and new power plants in 2000.
The older power stations produced around twice as much sulphur dioxide and 25% more nitrogen oxides than the newer plants which are required to meet higher environmental standards.
The members of the new Air Quality Experts Group have been announced.
The AQEG is to be chaired by Professor Mike Pilling of Leeds University and is made up of 18 scientists with a range of skills and expertise in the field of air pollution.
The Air Quality Expert Group will advise Government on levels and sources of pollution, analyse trends of pollution concentrations and assess the impact of proposed reduction strategies.
A third runway at Heathrow may however cause many thousands of homes to be demolished because of increased air pollution levels.
Notes contained within the consultation documents make reference to homes being pulled down where pollution exceeds EU limits.
If a third runway were to be built at Heathrow, many thousands of people could be exposed to levels of air pollution above EU limits unless aviation technology advances at a much faster rate to reduce emissions from aircraft.
The areas facing the greatest pollution include Sipson, Harlington, Hayes and West Drayton.
Westminster Council appealed, suggesting that making a charge to drive through central London would increase air pollution in surrounding areas.
Many councils around the UK will now be watching to see how the congestion-charging scheme works before trying it out for themselves.
HEALTH EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE UK
Warmer winters could mean 20,000 fewer deaths and cut hospital admissions by two million days as global climate change heats up Britain, a report by leading scientists from the Department of Health disclosed last month.
The Department of Health report, which builds upon last year's Health Effects of Climate Change in the UK (April 2001), looks at whether the NHS will be able to cope with the rapidly changing weather patterns experienced by the UK.
It forecasts several thousand extra deaths each summer from the effects of air pollutants by 2050.
Last year's report, the Health Effects of Climate Change in the UK is available through the Department of Health website:
Last month, a dense blanket of pollution, dubbed the "Asian Brown Cloud" that develops each summer, returned to cover much of South Asia, with scientists warning it could pose a global threat.
The cloud, estimated to be two miles thick, is believed to be responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths a year from respiratory disease.
By reducing sunlight levels by 10 to 15%, the smog has also altered the region's climate, cooling the ground while heating the atmosphere.
Lying over the entire Indian subcontinent, from Sri Lanka to Afghanistan, the pollution has led to some erratic weather, sparking flooding in Bangladesh, Nepal and northeastern India, but drought in Pakistan and northwestern India.
It is also causing acid rain.
Scientists have calculated that the cloud is largely the result of man-made pollution, in particular emissions from inefficient cookers, where fuels such as cow dung and kerosene are used to cook food in many parts of Asia.
During August, more than 70 people were killed by floods in China as heavy rains cause havoc across many parts of Asia, with floods destroying huge areas of eastern India, Nepal and Bangladesh.
The onset of a new El Niño episode has been blamed as the likely culprit.
El Niño refers to an above-average warming of ocean water in the eastern Pacific that occurs every 4 to 5 years and distorts wind and rainfall patterns, leading to floods and droughts.
The last El Niño in 1997-98 is believed to be responsible for the loss of around 24,000 lives.
Australia meanwhile is experiencing a prolonged winter drought.
Farmers in the eastern state of New South Wales have now gone months without substantial rain, slashing the yields of wheat crops and forcing livestock to be slaughtered.
It seems that Europe has not escaped the effects of the erratic weather either.
Devastating floods due to record rainfall also hit parts of the Czech Republic and Austria last month.
Scientists have speculated that El Niño may influence the course of the Northern Hemisphere Jet Stream, which this summer has tracked across Europe, further south than usual bringing depressions and bad weather.
AEA Technology has conducted a study into the effects of cleaner fuels and engine technologies and the resultant changes in pollution concentrations.
The study looked at likely concentrations of pollutants from the early 1990s onwards, as if no engine or fuel changes had occurred.
These levels were then compared to actual data for 1999 and then modelled to 2010.
The study has shown that catalytic converters (introduced from 1993) have had the biggest impact on emissions, making up 46% of all reductions when modelled to 2010.
Cleaner diesel has also had a significant impact, accounting for 18% of all reductions.
In London however, the catalytic converter has not had a big impact of air pollution concentrations.
The reason for this is that many city car journeys are relatively short and this causes the catalytic converter to be less effective.
The use of cleaner fuels over the last decade has had a bigger contribution to reducing NO
concentrations in London than the effect of catalytic converters.
It should also be noted that whilst concentrations of pollutants have been decreasing, the effect of the introduction of technologies such as catalytic converters and the use of cleaner fuels has been offset somewhat by increasing numbers of vehicles.
The 2002 Budget delivered by Gordon Brown included some measures which may help reduce air pollution.
Some greener fuels such as Biodiesel will be 20p per litre cheaper because of a cut in fuel duty, compared to ordinary diesel.
Other green fuels such as zero sulphur petrol and methanol and alternative fuels such as hydrogen and natural gas also benefit.
The least polluting cars, small vans and motorcycles will benefit from cuts in road tax.
However, motoring organisations feel that the small difference in road tax will not be enough of an incentive to encourage drivers to purchase a low emission vehicle.
Promoting greener power, the Chancellor announced that firms producing electricity in combined, heat and power stations or from coal mine methane will be exempt from the climate change levy.
Other alternative energy sources such as wind and wave power were however not included.
Emission data for 2000 shows a reduction for all main air pollutants compared to emission data for 1999.
Emission quantities for some of the UK pollutants are shown below, comparing emissions in 1980 and 2000.
The pollutant which has not shown such a dramatic reduction is the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide.
The Kyoto Protocol target for the UK is a 20% reduction on 1990 carbon dioxide emissions by 2010.
The inspector noted that windows could not be opened without exposure to high levels of noise and pollution.
The Department for Food & Rural Affairs and the Welsh Assembly have selected Wrexham as a new air pollution monitoring site, to be added to the existing UK's Automatic Urban & Rural Network of around 140 sites.
Data on air pollution levels in Wrexham along with all other urban and rural sites can be found at:
A new study in California carried out amongst 846 asthmatic children in eight urban areas over a summer period, compared air pollution levels with reports of asthma symptoms.
The study showed that rises in breathing problems during mornings were associated with rises in air pollution levels.
During the study period the air pollution levels were below US air quality standards, leading the researchers to suggest that current levels of urban air pollution can worsen asthma in children.
Some experts however believe that the rise in child asthma is more likely to be due to other factors such as living in centrally heated, double glazed homes, than air pollution.
In March, two large pieces of ice broke away from the Antarctic continent, raising fears that global warming may be contributing to the accelerated break-up and melting of ice sheets at the edge of the Southern Hemisphere polar landmass.
On the Antarctic Peninsula, the Larsen B ice shelf has collapsed, reducing it to perhaps its smallest size in 12,000 years.
The corresponding iceberg that broke away was as large as Cornwall.
During the same period, a massive iceberg broke away from the Thwaites Glacier on the other side of the continent.
Local warming in the region of the Antarctic Peninsula has been very pronounced during the last 50 years, at a rate over 5 times greater than for the Earth as a whole.
Whilst such rapid temperature increases in the polar latitudes may be a signal of man-made interference with the global climate, scientists are as yet still unclear whether this local warming has extended across the whole of Antarctica, and whether any natural influence on climate have contributed to the warming.
Scientists are warning however, that this is probably not the end of the iceshelf disintegration, with the Larsen C ice shelf (to the south of Larsen B) close to it's instability threshold, and the much larger Ross Ice Shelf only a few degrees Celsius away from further disintegration.
In some polar regions, for example in parts of Alaska, where there has been a substantial melting of permafrost, the temperature of the continental rocks has increased by as much as five degrees Celsius.
The research also confirms that the oceans and atmosphere have experienced a similar warming trend over the period studied.
The Earth will warm by up to 1.3°C over the next 30 years, according to a new forecast of climate change prepared by British scientists.
The climate projection, by Peter Stott of the Meteorological Office and Jamie Kettleborough of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Didcot, Oxfordshire, suggests that the global mean temperature in the 10 years to 2030 could be between 0.3°C and 1.3°C higher than is was between 1990 and 2000.
While the figures do not look large, the total warming effect seen since 1900 was just 0.6°C, and the predicted rise would have profound consequences for agriculture and sea levels around the world.
The new figures are consistent with a 100-year Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change forecast, which predicts a rise of between 1.4°C and 5.8°C by 2100.
By comparison, the rise in average global temperature since the last ice age 18,000 years ago was 5°C.
The British research into the shorter timescale projection of future climate changes is supported by the findings of a separate research team, led by Thomas Stocker of the University of Berne in Switzerland, which suggests a probable warming of between 0.5°C and 1.1°C over the same period.

According to a leaked report compiled by the Australian Greenhouse Office, Australia will fail dramatically to limit greenhouse gas emissions to an increase of 8% allowed under the terms of the Kyoto Protocol.

Council employees of Bath and North East Somerset are being paid 40p per mile to cycle on business, which is more than the average of 35p per mile paid to go by car.
The incentive has been introduced to try and encourage less polluting modes of travel.
Take-up since introduction has been slow, but the wet winter weather has been blamed for this.
Employees have indicated that dry weather will sway them to get on their bikes!
A new report has been published by the National Expert Group on Transboundary Air Pollution (NEGTAP).
The report describes the current status of the problems of acid deposition, eutrophication and ground-level ozone pollution in the UK and includes emissions and deposition of pollutants and their effects on soils, waters and vegetation.
The report highlights that acid rain in the UK has more than halved since 1985.
This is due to efforts in the 1980s and 1990s to reduce emissions from power stations and vehicles.
Sulphur dioxide emissions have been cut by around 80% from their peak values and nitrogen oxides by 40% from their peak values.
However, methane emissions have changed little over the past 15 years.
However, there is little sign of recovery for acid sensitive UK soils.
It may take decades before such ecosystems recover even despite reduced emissions of air pollutants.
The reduction in sulphur dioxide has seen the increase of some lichen species.
Emissions of sulphur dioxide have been falling faster than emissions of nitrogen oxides.
These are both expected to continue to decline but by 2010, nitrogen deposition is still likely to be a problem in the UK.
Ground-level ozone has declined by 30% between 1986 and 1999 but the thresholds for effects on health and vegetation are still regularly exceeded.
The effects of ground-level ozone on vegetation are still likely to be a problem by 2010.
The report by NEGTAP can be viewed at www.nbu.ac.uk/negtap/finalreport.htm
Boeing is hoping to follow the car industry's lead by using fuel cells to provide power for everything from air conditioning to in-flight movies.
There are no plans for Boeing to replace jet engines with fuel cells but replacing the auxiliary engines with fuel cells will reduce noise and air pollution emissions.
David Jamieson, the Transport Minister has announced plans for a scheme to promote petrol free vehicles.
In a draft strategy entitled 'Powering Future Vehicles', he stated that "Large reductions in the emissions from transport are essential if we are to deliver cleaner air and combat global warming.
'Powering Future Vehicles' sets out how Government proposes to do this, while at the same time generally improving cars and benefiting UK industry.
"
The report suggests that within the next ten years, 8-12% of vehicles sold may be low-emission vehicles such as hybrid or fuel cell vehicles which will help reduce pollution emissions from the transport sector.
The publication of the latest National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (NAEI) reveals that levels of pollutants emitted in the UK are continuing to fall.
Since 1990, reductions in emissions of certain pollutants are as follows:
Emissions of pollutants have fallen due to a number of factors over the past decade.
These include the introduction of catalytic converters to cars, industrial pollution control technologies like flue gas desulphurisation, a switch from coal to gas in some power stations, introduction of lead free petrol and cleaner fuels and the reduction of many practises such as agricultural burning and coal mining.
The Environment Minister, Michael Meacher stated that the trend of falling emissions was good news but warned against complacency, particularly with regard to greenhouse gas emissions, particles and methane which have been reduced much less than other pollutants.
AIR POLLUTION CAN BE HARMFUL TO BABIES AND UNBORN INFANTS
New research from around the world is indicating that babies and unborn infants are being harmed by atmospheric pollution.
New research is suggesting that air pollution can reach the womb.
Several studies in the United States, Brazil, Mexico, Europe, South Korea and Taiwan have linked smog to low birth weight, premature births, stillbirths and infant deaths.
Some of the research has been carried out in Los Angeles, a city well know for smog, but which now has many air pollution control systems.
In a study of thousands of pregnant women in Los Angeles, comparisons were made between those who lived in relatively clean air and those that lived in relatively dirty air.
Most of the study area met the current standards for carbon monoxide and ozone pollution.
However, the study revealed that mothers living in the areas where there were higher levels of ozone and carbon monoxide were three times more likely to have babies with cleft lips and palates and heart valve defects.
The study also highlighted that the greatest risk occurs during the second month of pregnancy when the foetus is developing facial structure and organs.
Pollutants inhaled by the mother can reach the womb through the umbilical cord.
At the 8th Conference of Parties (COP8) to the Framework Convention on Climate Change in Marrakesh, Morocco, November 2001, ministers from 171 governments finally reached agreement on the operational rules for the Kyoto Protocol.
The Kyoto Protocol (1997) commits signatory nations to real greenhouse gas emission reductions by the period 2008-2012.
Globally, nations are required to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by 5.2% below 1990 levels.
At COP8, Parties secured agreement on a range of issues, including how to measure greenhouse gas emissions and reductions, how to include carbon sinks like forests into emission reduction targets, and how emissions trading between nations can be implemented.
The Protocol will become legally binding once at least 55 parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change (1992) have ratified it, including industrialised countries that account for 55% of the world's total greenhouse gas emissions.
To date 40 countries have ratified the Protocol, including one industrialised nation, Romania.
Global climate change has often been seen as a process stretching over hundred or thousands of years.
Research from the National (US) Academy of Science warns that gradual global warming coupled with other human impacts on the environment could trigger a sudden climatic change.
Looking at geological and ice core evidence, scientists believe that such rapid climate shifts have occurred frequently in the past, moving temperatures drastically in the space of just a few decades, and even within a single human generation.
Ice cores drilled from glaciers and other ice sheets have revealed temperatures fluctuating rapidly with unsettling frequency over the past 100 millennia.
The most drastic temperature changes could have been as much as 10°C over the space of just a few years, exceeding any recorded in human history.
The most immediate dangers posed by abrupt climate change are devastating droughts and floods, which could seriously affect both water supply and agriculture, particularly in the developing world.
Longer-term impacts could include changes in the Gulf Stream, the current of warm Atlantic water which now keeps much of Northern Europe temperate.
A slowing or reversal of this ocean current, arising from a rapid influx of colder meltwater from the north, would quickly impact European weather.
The European Commission have approved plans for British companies to trade pollution.
This will allow firms to buy and sell the right to pollute.
However, the EU warned that the British plans may have to change when the European emissions trading scheme starts in 2005.
The greenhouse gas trading system is due to be launched in April next year and is intended to encourage industries to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
The British scheme is voluntary.
The government will provide £30 million which firms can bid for a share of, in order to buy the right to emit more than their allowance of carbon dioxide emissions.
By then, experts predict, energy generated by wind turbines placed out in coastal waters would represent one-third of all European wind power.
At a time when security of energy supply and action to tackle climate change are high on the agenda, it is not surprising that there is such interest in offshore wind energy.
AIR POLLUTION FROM FOOT AND MOUTH ANIMAL PYRES
Levels of dioxins from incomplete burning of animal flesh are known to be potential sources of dioxin pollution.
The animal pyres have largely been fuelled by railway sleepers, impregnated with creosote and tar.
These are also potential sources of dioxin pollution.
There have been dense smoke plumes from these fires, which have been in remote areas, away from urban monitoring equipment.
Most UK rural monitoring is limited to ozone and hence particle pollution episodes have not been highlighted.
The UK DETR has revealed that during the first six weeks of the UK foot and mouth crisis, burning animal carcasses has led to 63g of dioxin emissions being released into the atmosphere, 18% of UK annual average emissions.
A task force team of international scientists has begun to target air pollution in Mexico City, one of the world's smoggiest cities.
The team is led by Nobel research prize-winner Dr Mario Molina who has previously conducted research into CFCs and the destruction of the ozone layer.
Mexico City has a major particulate problem.
The city is situated in a basin, surrounded by high mountains and this, combined with a predominantly dry and sunny climate and a large number of vehicles and polluting industries gives Mexico it's reputation for poor air quality.
Dr Molina has made a six-month plan with 71 recommendations as the first part of Proaire, a new governmental 10-year air quality programme.
Key initiatives include reducing the amount of sulphur in gasoline, controlling diesel emissions and improving the monitoring of vehicle emissions.
The measures will mean a dramatic overhaul of the city's transport system.
Plans to control air pollution include constructing long distance natural gas pipelines and storage tanks, converting small coal burning boilers and prohibiting any kind of burning in the open.
Solar energy and geothermal energy technologies are also to be used to replace the need for burning coal.
The Environmental Action Fund awards for 2001/02 have been announced by DETR.
aric is pleased to receive an award for operating its integrated Atmosphere, Climate and Environment Information Programme.
NSCA have also received funding for the development of an educational pack on noise pollution.
The Expert Panel on Air Quality Standards has reviewed the measurement of particles for the UK.
Measurement of particles at UK monitoring stations are those particles less than 10 mm aerodynamic diameter, known as PM10.
There has been controversy as to whether this is a suitable measurement or whether smaller particles, which may have more implications for health, should be measured, such as PM2.5.
EPAQS have presented their findings in a new report Airborne Particles which concludes that, on present evidence, the PM10 measurement is the most appropriate basis for an Air Quality Standard in the UK, although the panel recommend that this should be kept under active review.
END OF THE ROAD FOR KYOTO PROTOCOL?
George W. Bush, the President of the Unties States of America, last month decided to pull his country out of the Kyoto Protocol, the international agreement to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, which threaten global warming.
The Kyoto Protocol required the US to reduce its 1990-level greenhouse gas emissions by 7% by the period 2008-2012.
Bush's decision, whilst criticised around the world by other Parties to the Protocol, has been welcomed back home by many business groups, including the coal and oil industries.
The Global Climate Coalition (GCC), which represents a number of corporate interests in the climate debate, also praised the new position, not so much for pulling out of the Kyoto Protocol but because the Bush administration, like the GCC, supports market-based solutions and new technologies to address climate change.
Despite this, a CNN-Time poll conducted at the end of March reveals that as many as three-quarters of the US public believe that global warming is a serious problem, whilst two-thirds think that the president should develop greenhouse gas emission reduction strategies.
The problem facing the Kyoto Protocol now is whether it can survive without the Americans on board.
The Protocol will become legally binding once 55 Parties (nations) have ratified it, including industrialised nations that account for at least 55% of carbon dioxide emissions.
Since the US alone accounts for 34% of all industrialised nations' carbon dioxide emissions, a workable policy without the US may now seem unlikely.
Despite this, other countries, particularly within the European Union, have stressed that the Kyoto Protocol can survive without the US.
In addition, the environmental group Greenpeace issued a statement in which it said the United States was "isolated in the world in its rejection of the Protocol.
"
The next round of international talks on climate change will take place in Bonn in July later this year.
The 15 European Union (EU) countries recorded a 4% reduction between 1990 and 1999 in combined emissions of the six greenhouse gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol on climate change.
This contrasts with an 11% increase in emissions over the same period in the United States - which accounts for over a third of the industrialised world's man-made emissions.
The cut takes the EU - responsible for a quarter of industrialised countries' man-made emissions of the six gases - half way towards achieving the Kyoto target.
The inventory also shows that the EU remains on track to meet its commitment to stabilise emissions of carbon dioxide, the most important greenhouse gas, at the 1990 level by the year 2000.
However, the situation could rapidly change, the EEA has warned.
Preliminary estimates indicate that in 2000 both UK and German carbon dioxide emissions increased and on present trends, more than half of the other Member States may substantially exceed their agreed share of the EU's total allowed emissions under the Kyoto Protocol.
By analysing variations in the spectrum of outgoing infrared radiation collected by orbiting spacecraft in the early 1970s and during 1996-1997, the researchers were able to detect changes in the effect of greenhouse gases on temperature.
The apparent change in the amount of energy emitted by the Earth is consistent with increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations over the same time period.
The electricity will be used for home lighting, irrigation and the distribution of drinking water.
Community centres such as schools and health clinics will also benefit.
The quality of urban air during 2000 was the best yet on record, according to figures released by the UK Environment Minister, Michael Meacher.
17 days during 2000 were categorised as moderate or high pollution compared to 30 in 1999 and 23 in 1998.
Rural air quality was also better during 2000 than for the previous two years.
The quality of the air is summarised by creating an air quality headline indicator, based on the number of days certain pollutants exceed the National Air Quality Standards.
These pollutants are particulates (PM10), ozone, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide.
Ozone is usually the pollutant which causes the most exceedences of Air Quality Standards in both urban and rural areas.
There are 15 headline indicators which include economic indicators such as employment, social indicators such as health, education and crime and environmental indicators including air quality, climate change and water quality.
A new website has been created to identify the local authorities that have declared air quality management areas (AQMAs).
To date, 19 authorities have declared AQMAs.
On the website these are shown on a map of the UK, highlighting a concentration of authorities centred on the London area.
www.aeat.co.uk/netcen/airqual/welcome.html in the Air Quality Management Areas.
The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) has called on Ken Livingston, London Mayor, to introduce hydrogen buses across London to reduce deaths from traffic pollution which now exceed the number of deaths by road accidents (see Atmospheric Issues, January 2001).
A report by TRL suggests that air quality improvements have been achieved since the new bus lane was implemented on the M4 motorway along with a 50-mph speed limit a year ago.
The report suggests that carbon dioxide emissions have been reduced by around 16% during off peak hours and that the noise level has been reduced by 1 decibel.
The UK Transport Minister Keith Hill has recently announced that 44 tonne lorries will be allowed on British roads from 1 February 2001.
This should reduce the number of lorry journeys made on our roads along with vehicle pollution.
The Transport Minister also qualified this decision by stating that the new lorries will be heavier but not larger and will have less polluting Euro II standard engines.
The new lorries will be no noisier and will have to meet the same stopping distance requirements as lighter vehicles.
The 44 tonne lorries will also cause less wear to roads and bridges than the 40 tonne, five axle lorries permitted now because they have an extra axle and a lower maximum axle weight.
In January 2001, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a draft report of the Third Assessment Report of Working Group I that builds upon past assessments and incorporates new results from the past five years of research on climate change.
In the report the IPCC confirms that Earth's average surface temperature could rise by almost 6ºC by 2100 - a rise unprecedented in the past 10,000 years.
At the same time sea levels could rise by almost a metre.
Whilst the IPCC recognise that natural factors alone can influence the global climate, the warming over the past 100 years is very unlikely to be due to internal variability alone, but to predominantly man-made greenhouse gas pollution.
According to the report, the 1990s was the warmest decade for 1,000 years.
Temperatures rose by an average of 0.6ºC during the last century, with an increase in floods and droughts.
Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have risen by 31% since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, largely as a result of burning fossil fuels.
In February 2001 the UK Department of Health published the first official report into the possible health effects of climate change.
The report identifies environmental factors that could affect the health of the population and will assist the Government's long term planning on issues of climate change and health in the UK.
The report was produced by the Expert Group on Climate Change and Health, including experts from the meteorological and climate changes fields, as well as from physiology, public health, epidemiology and microbiology.
The Health Effects of Climate Change report is being published as a scientific review for comment.
While accepting the difficulties of predicting the impact of climate change on the health of the UK population, the report concludes that climate change will have a significant effect on health in the UK.
However, not all the effects will be negative.
The report suggests that the National Health Service should cope well with the impact of climate change, given adequate planning and resources, and concludes that early action may mitigate many of the possible consequential health effects of change.
Insect-borne diseases may present local problems, but the increase in their overall impact is likely to be small;
The risk from disasters caused by severe winter gales and coastal flooding is likely to increase;
In general, the effects of air pollutants on health are likely to decline but the effects of ozone during the summer are likely to increase: several thousand extra deaths and a similar number of hospital admissions may occur each year;
Measures taken to reduce the rate of climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions could produce secondary beneficial effects on health.
KYOTO CLIMATE TARGETS BEYOND REACH OF THE UK?
Although the Government has committed itself to reducing emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, to 20% below their 1990 levels by 2010, the UK is likely to miss its internationally agreed targets for reducing the greenhouse gases which cause global warming, according to a report published by Cambridge Econometrics, the independent energy analysts.
Instead, carbon dioxide emissions will increase over the next decade and in 2010 will be only 6.5% lower than in 1990.
The report singles out road users and households as the main culprits.
Thanks to the so-called dash for gas during the 1990s, emissions from power stations are falling and in 2010 are expected to be 23% lower than in 1990, while more efficient use of energy will allow industry to cut emissions by more than 15%.
But households and car owners will have to become more energy efficient as well if the UK is to meet the targets it agreed at the Kyoto climate change talks in 1997.
UN scientists believe that the world's average temperature will rise by 6ºC by 2100 (see "Latest IPCC Climate Projections"), even after implementation of the Kyoto Protocol targets, which many countries have yet to sign up to.
According to the IPCC Climate Change Report released in January 2001 (see latest IPCC Climate Projections), climate change could have dramatic consequences for the Arctic this century.
Scientists have not ruled out the possibility that the entire Arctic could become ice-free.
If the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide reaches twice its pre-industrial levels, the report says, then the summer sea ice in the Arctic could shrink by up to 60%.
This could happen by as early as 2050, nearer to us now than the end of the Second World War.
The extent of the Arctic sea ice has declined by almost a third in the past 130 years, and the report says it is possible that the Arctic could lose all its ice.
Considerable ice sheet melting is also expected to occur on Greenland.
Additionally, there is concern about the permafrost, the layer of permanently frozen soil which serves as the solid foundation for buildings and other structures throughout the Arctic.
Melting permafrost in Siberia has already weakened buildings in several cities.
Furthermore, the Arctic permafrost stores a lot of carbon dioxide and methane, which if released through melting, will cause a positive feedback adding to the warming process.

The Index ranks countries on a scale from 0 to 100 according to performance in 22 factors associated with environmental sustainability, including urban air quality, public health and environmental regulation.
Top of the list of 122 countries ranked by ESI are Finland, Norway and Canada.
A country's ranking offers an overall indicator of a nation's ability to sustain human life through food resources and a safe environment, and to deal with both national and international environmental challenges.
In August 2000 aric launched its new on-line Encyclopedia of the Atmospheric Environment.
The Encyclopedia has been written by aric's Atmosphere, Climate & Environment Information Programme, and is supported by the Department of the Environment, Transport & The Regions (DETR).
It is a one-stop source of information, for younger and older users alike, on a range of atmospheric issues, including air quality, acid rain, global warming and ozone depletion.
OFFICIAL ADVICE ON HEALTH EFFECTS OF AIR POLLUTION
The Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollution Control (COMEAP) has produced official guidance aimed at informing the public on the effects of air pollution.
The advice intends to dispel common myths about air pollution.
COMEAP states that long term exposure to air pollution is unlikely to be the cause of increasing numbers of asthma sufferers but that air pollution probably shortens life expectancy by as much as one year.
Air pollution is of less concern however than a number of other factors such as smoking, eating a poor diet and lack of exercise.
COMEAP also highlight that those with heart or lung disease can have their condition worsened by air pollution and that air pollution can aggravate asthma, but does not appear to be a causal factor.
Advice given by COMEAP states that people can improve the air in their homes by not smoking; maintaining heating appliances and ensuring adequate ventilation.
Other advice offered includes: minimising exposure when air pollution levels are high by avoiding vigorous exercise and busy roads; using vehicles less; not smoking and eating a healthy diet.
Westminster City Council in London has produced an air quality action plan, following its declaration of the whole borough as an Air Quality Management Area.
Plans to clean the air in Westminster include the creation of a low emission zone which will prevent certain diesel trucks from entering the zone.
Only diesel trucks and buses which meet Euro 3 standards would be allowed to travel through the area specified.
Westminster have declared the whole borough an AQMA although given the relaxation of the particles objective in the latest Air Quality Strategy, many parts of Westminster are not likely to exceed nitrogen dioxide or particulate standards.
However, Westminster City Council wishes to go beyond the guidelines on the basis of occupational exposure, for example those working outdoors, bus and taxi drivers or those working in offices along busy roads.
The consultation document on Westminster City Council's air quality action plan is available for £10 from Sylvia Joseph (Tel: 020 7461 5976).
An Indo-UK research programme on the impacts of climate change in India was launched on the 18 August 2000 in New Delhi, India.
India's Ministry of the Environment & Forests (MoEF) and the UK's Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR), have joined forces on a three-year study into the potential effects of global warming over the next 80 years.
Indian scientists will carry out studies to build a comprehensive picture of the possible future impacts of climate change in India.
The DETR will provide £650,000 to fund the initial studies and programme management.
Collaboration between Indian and UK researchers will be encouraged.
The project will also involve the UK's Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research.
The programme of research will include the development of climate change and socio-economic scenarios for India and assessment of impacts on water resources, agriculture, forests, industries, energy and transport, human health and coastal zones.
NASA is a little more than a year away from launching a satellite capable of making regular measurements of even the minutest changes in the thickness of the ice capping the Arctic, Antarctica and Greenland.
The Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite, or ICESat, will carry a single science instrument, called Geoscience Laser Altimeter System, or GLAS, to accomplish the task, regularly tracking any changes in depth over time.
It will rely on the speed of light and the spacecraft's location in space to carry out the monitoring.
GLAS will bounce a laser beam down onto the ice 40 times a second, timing how long it takes for the pulse to complete the roughly 744-mile (1,200-kilometre) roundtrip, and making regular measurements of the changes to the thickness of ice caps.
Scientists will use the data to track ice melt, which could lead to a rise in global sea levels.
A claim that the North Pole is ice-free for the first time in 50 million years was published in the 19th August edition of the New York Times.
On a trip to the Arctic, Dr. James McCarthy of the American Museum of Natural History and the director of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University witnessed the mile-wide ice-free cap.
However, Dr Peter Wadhams, director of the Scott Polar Institute in Cambridge, argued that "Claims that the North Pole is now ice-free for the first time in 50 million years is complete rubbish, absolute nonsense .
. .
What is happening is of concern but it is gradual, not sudden or stupendous.
"
Indeed, in a correction published in the 29th August edition, the New York Times said it had misstated the normal conditions of sea ice at the North Pole.
It said open water probably has occurred there before because the Arctic Ocean is about 10% ice-free during a typical summer.
The newspaper also said the lack of ice at the North Pole is not necessarily a result of global warming.
Scientists at Ohio University in Athens, Ohio, USA, have embarked on a project to absorb carbon dioxide emissions at point sources.
The researchers, backed by a US $1.07 million grant from the US Department of Energy (DOE), are studying how algae, through photosynthesis, can absorb some of the carbon dioxide produced after coal, a fossil fuel, is burned.
Carbon dioxide is passed through tubes of moving water, creating bicarbonates.
The water then flows through a bioreactor containing a series of screens on which algae grow.
"The algae basically drink the bicarbonates.
They get carbon through this system much quicker than trying to get it out of the air," says project researcher David Bayless.
Bayless estimates that an average plant using this technology could process 20% of its carbon dioxide emissions and produce 200,000 metric tons or more of algae per year, which is efficient and cost-effective.
The technology by itself however, will not solve the carbon dioxide problem for coal-burning power plants according to Bayless.
).
The gas is extremely rare, but concentrations in the atmosphere are increasing.
It is also thought to be extremely longed-lived, in the order of 1,000 years.
has a climate change potential of 0.57 watts per square meter, per parts per billion concentration in the atmosphere.
This is the largest climate change potential on a per molecule basis of any gas found in the atmosphere, some 18,000 times greater than the heat-trapping capability of the most common greenhouse gas carbon dioxide.
The source of the gas is unknown, but there is some speculation that it is associated with high-voltage equipment.
It is believed that the gas has been present in the atmosphere for only the past 40 years, suggesting strongly that it is man-made.
in the atmosphere are rising at about 6% per year.
However, the levels in the atmosphere are still relatively low and are unlikely to have a significant effect on global warming.
The 1998 and 1999 annual ground level ozone reports for the European Commission show no overall reduction in the exposure of the population or ecosystems to ozone.
The reports identified that levels of ozone measured at most of the 1400 monitoring sites remain well above the ceilings set by the European Council's Framework Directive on ozone (Directive 92/72/EC).
Several particulate (PM10) monitors recorded exceedences of the 50µg/m3 target throughout the UK during early March 2000.
The sources of these episodes have been identified as dust blown from the North African Saharan desert and from the Icelandic Hekla volcanic eruption.
PM2.5 monitors were expected to register these particles, but not the PM10 monitors which record coarser particles.
The Expert Panel of Air Quality Scientists (EPAQS) are currently considering whether to introduce PM2.5 for air quality standards, as in the United States.
Fine particles are known to be more problematic for human health than coarser particles because they can enter deep into the lungs.
The maximum hourly concentration was recorded at Plymouth (290µg/m3); Port Talbot also monitored several exceedences on March 3rd.
At many sites, this natural particulate episode accounts for 5 of the 35 exceedences allowed in the new Air Quality Strategy objectives for PM10 (see Atmospheric Issues March 2000), thus in some way justifying the relaxation of the target which previously allowed only 4 exceedences per year.
aric have received a further year of Environmental Action Fund support from DETR to continue work on the Atmosphere, Climate & Environment Information Programme.
Over the year 2000/01, aric expects to deal with in excess of 8000 information requests and will continue to focus on information provision particularly via the aric website.
aric is also pleased to report its acceptance of a Britannia Internet award for quality and accuracy of site content.
In March's Budget the Chancellor, Gordon Brown, announced several measures which should help to improve air quality.
These are summarised below:
Westminster City Council in London has decided to concentrate on cutting emissions from heavy trucks and buses rather than cars in an attempt to improve air quality.
Westminster proposes to cut emissions from heavy duty vehicles by setting up low emission zones.
These may ban trucks unless they have a permit to confirm their vehicle meets Euro 2 emission standards or better.
According to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the winter of 1999/2000 was the warmest in the United States since records began more than a century ago.
This was the third year in a row of increasingly record warm winters, with average surface temperature during December to February 0.3oC above the previous year's record.
Accompanying the record warmth has been a sustained period of drought for much of the continental US.
Below average rainfall is predicted to continue into 2000 due to the La Niña pattern in the equatorial Pacific, the reverse (cold) phase of El Niño.
In March the Department of the Environment, Transport & The Regions (DETR) published the 1998 emission estimates for greenhouse gases and other air pollutants, and a provisional 1999 estimate of total carbon dioxide emissions, for the UK.
The key points to note are:
Emissions of the 'basket' of six greenhouse gases, weighted by global warming potential, fell by 8.5% between 1990 and 1998.
To meet its commitment to the Kyoto Protocol, the UK has agreed to reduce emissions by 12.5% relative to the 1990 level over the period 2008-2012.
Emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, fell by 7% between 1990 and 1998.
The UK aims to move beyond its Kyoto target towards its goal of reducing emissions of carbon dioxide by 20% below 1990 levels by 2010.
1999 emissions of carbon dioxide are provisionally estimated at 155.5 million tonnes (weight of carbon), about 0.5% lower than in 1998 and 7.5% lower than in 1990.
This March, one of the largest icebergs ever recorded broke off of Antarctica's Ross Ice Shelf.
The immense block of ice - dubbed B15 - is 300 kilometres (186 miles) long and 37 kilometres (23 miles) wide, and is over a quarter of the size of Switzerland.
Icebergs like B15 occur when ice at the edge of an ice shelf finally succumbs to the forces of the sea, which include warmer temperatures, currents and tides.
According to the U.S. National Science Foundation's McMurdo Station in Antarctica the calving off of this tremendous iceberg is quite normal.
Researchers believe that icebergs like B15 break away from all Antarctic ice shelves every 50 to 100 years as part of their natural cycle of ice loss and regeneration.
According to iceberg observation records, the Ross Ice Shelf has been due for a major purge.
Researchers also note that this event is probably not a global warming issue at this time, but scientists will be keeping an eye on this area to see if anymore very large icebergs break free in the near future.
-equivalent concentration of a “basket” of gases by 2100 or at some later date when atmospheric stabilization is actually reached.
There are two common difficulties associated with the formulation and quantification of mitigation scenarios.
First, in certain cases there is not a clear-cut distinction between intervention and non-intervention scenarios, that is, scenarios with or without explicit climate policy.
This is discussed in detail in Box 2.1 .
The second important problem regarding mitigation scenarios has to do with the difference between top-down and bottom-up models.
Whereas the latter focus on engineering trends and technology costs, the former view resource development from a macroeconomic price-mediated perspective.
Although, as discussed in the SAR (IPCC, 1995), the differences between these approaches are continiously narrowing as each incorporates elements of the other, there is still quite a difference in their formulation of emission reduction strategies.
This suggests the importance of including multiple methodological approaches in scenario analysis.
Recent discussions among IPCC experts and reactions from reviewers of this report and the SRES report revealed the need to clarify differences between various types of GHG emission scenarios, in particular, between climate policy scenarios (CP scenarios) and scenarios without climate policies (NCP scenarios) but with low emissions.
CP scenarios (also known as climate intervention or climate mitigation scenarios) are defined in this report as those that: (1) include explicit policies and/or measures, the primary
goal of which is to reduce GHG emissions (e.g., carbon tax) and/or (2) mention no climate policies and/or measures, but assume temporal changes in GHG emission sources or drivers required to achieve particular climate targets (e.g., GHG emission levels, GHG concentration levels, temperature increase or sea level rise limits).
CP scenarios are often, but not always, constructed with reference to a corresponding reference or baseline scenario that is similar to the CP scenario in every respect except the inclusion of climate mitigation measures and/or policies.
In fact, climate policy analysis often starts with the construction of such a reference scenario, to which is added climate policy to create the CP scenario.
Another type of CP scenario is not originally built around such “no-policy” baselines.
Developers of such scenarios envision future “worlds” that are internally consistent with desirable climate targets (e.g., a global temperature increase of no more than 1°C by 2100), and then work “backwards” to develop feasible emission trajectories and emission driver combinations leading to these targets.
Such scenarios, also referred to as “safe landing” or “tolerable windows” scenarios, imply the necessary development and implementation of climate policies, intended to achieve these targets in the most efficient way.
The general definition of CP scenarios provided here enables one to effectively discriminate between CP scenarios and other scenarios with low emissions (e.g., IS92c, SRES-B1).
Unlike the former, NCP scenarios have low emissions but do not assume any explicit emission abatement measures or policies, nor are they designed specifically to achieve certain climate targets.
NCP scenarios by themselves may explore a wide variety of alternative development paths, including “green” or “dematerialization” futures.
Confusion can arise when the inclusion of “non-climate-related” policies in a NCP scenario has the effect of significantly reducing GHG emissions.
For example, energy efficiency or land use policies that reduce GHG emissions may be adopted for reasons that are not related to climate policies and may therefore be included in a NCP scenario.
Such a NCP scenario may have GHG emissions that are lower than some CP scenarios.
The root cause of this potential confusion is that, in practice, many policies can both reduce GHG emissions and achieve other goals.
Whether such policies are assumed to be adopted for climate or non-climate policy related reasons in any given scenario is determined by the scenario developer based on the underlying scenario narrative.
While this is a problem in terms of making a clear distinction between CP and NCP scenarios, it is at the same time an opportunity.
Because many decisions are not made for reasons of climate change alone, measures implemented for reasons other than climate change can have a large impact on GHG emissions, opening up many new possibilities for mitigation.
Chapters 7, 8, and 9 discuss ancillary benefits of climate mitigation and the co-benefits of policies integrating climate mitigation objectives with other goals.
The climate issue is embedded in the larger question of how combined social, economic, and environmental subsystems interact and shape one another over many decades.
There are multiple links.
Economic development depends on maintenance of ecosystem resilience; poverty can be both a result and a cause of environmental degradation; material-intensive lifestyles conflict with environmental and equity values; and extreme socio-economic inequality within societies and between nations undermines the social cohesion required for effective policy responses.
It is clear that climate policy, and the impacts of climate change, will have significant implications for sustainable development at both the global and sub-global levels.
In addition, policy and behavioural responses to sustainable development issues may affect both our ability to develop and successfully implement climate policies, and our ability to respond effectively to climate change.
In this way, climate policy response will affect the ability of countries to achieve sustainable development goals, while the pursuit of those goals will in turn affect the opportunities for, and success of, climate policy responses.
In this report and its Working Group II companion report, climate change impacts, mitigation, and adaptation strategies are discussed in the broader context of DES (see Munasinghe, 1999).
The issues raised by a consideration of DES are of particular relevance to the scenarios discussed in this chapter.
Because they are necessarily based upon assumptions about the socio-economic conditions that give rise to emissions profiles, mitigation and stabilization scenarios implicitly or explicitly contain information about DES.
In principle, each stabilization or mitigation scenario describes a particular future world, with particular economic, social, and environmental characteristics.
Given the strong interactions between development, environment, and equity as aspects of a unified socio-ecological system and the interplay between climate policies and DES policies, emissions scenarios are viewed in this report as an aspect of broad sustainable development scenarios.
The allocation of emissions in a scenario is coupled closely to an important policy question in climate negotiations: the fair distribution of future emission rights among nations, or “burden sharing”.
For example, an egalitarian formulation of the rights of developing countries to future “climate space” is often expressed in terms of equal per capita emissions allocations.
Alternative assumptions on burden sharing have important implications for equity, sustainable development, and the economics of emissions abatement.
However, it is noteworthy that this critical conditioning variable is usually not explicitly treated in mitigation scenarios in the literature (see section 2.3 ).
Indeed, documentation of scenarios generally does not address the implications of the scenarios for equity and burden sharing.
In rare cases, mitigation scenarios have been developed which explicitly impose the simultaneous co-constraints of climate and equity goals (e.g., Raskin et al., 1998).
In this and other ways scenario analysis could become an important way of linking DES issues to climate policy considerations.
However, as discussed in more detail in section 2.4 , many quantitative mitigation and stabilization scenarios have not been designed with this purpose in mind.
As a result, it is not always easy to draw out the DES implications of particular stabilization and mitigation scenarios.
Although this chapter focuses on mitigation and stabilization scenarios, it is important to note that DES issues are also implicit in the base case or reference scenarios that underlie mitigation and stabilization scenarios.
Since the difference between reference case scenarios and stabilization and mitigation scenarios is simply the addition of deliberate climate policy, it can be the case that the DES differences among different reference case scenarios are greater than between any one such scenario and its stabilization or mitigation version.
This is of particular relevance in the discussion below in section 2.5.2 of scenarios based on the baselines produced in the IPCC’s SRES (Nakicenovic et al., 2000).
The process of the post-SRES analysis was started by a public invitation to modellers.
A “Call for Scenarios” was sent to more than one hundred researchers in March 1999 by the Co-ordinating Lead Authors of this chapter and the SRES to facilitate an assessment of the potential implications of mitigation scenarios based on the SRES cases, which report was developed in support of the Third Assessment Report.
Modellers from around the world were invited to prepare quantified stabilization scenarios for two or more concentrations of atmospheric CO
concentration trajectories.
In addition, the generator was used by them to estimate the eventual level of atmospheric CO
The availability and dissemination of relevant knowledge on emissions and climate change;
The A1 world is well equipped to formulate and implement mitigation strategies in view of its high-tech, high-growth orientation and its willingness to co-operate at a global scale, provided the major actors acknowledge the need for mitigation.
There will be good monitoring and reporting on emissions and climate change, and possible signs of climate change will be detected early and become part of the international agenda.
Market-oriented policies and measures will be the preferred response.
Least-cost options will be searched for and implemented through international negotiation and mechanisms with the support of governments and multinational companies.
New emission reduction technologies from developed countries will enable developing countries to respond more rapidly and effectively if barriers to technology transfer can be overcome.
In this high-growth world, the economic costs associated with the response to climate change are likely to be bearable.
In the A1B scenario, where mitigation strategies may hit the limits of renewable energy supply, and in the A1FI scenario, carbon removal and storage as well as higher end-use energy efficiency will become major emission reduction options.
In the A1T scenario, technology developments are such that mitigation policies and measures only require limited additional efforts.
Developing and implementing climate change mitigation measures and policies in the A2 world can be quite complicated.
This is a result of several features embedded in the scenario storyline: rapid population growth, relatively slow GDP per capita growth, slow technological progress, and a regional and partially “isolationist” approach in national and international politics.
Because of all these serious challenges, the abatement of GHG emissions in the A2 world becomes plausible only in the situation when the negative effects of climate change become imminent and the associated losses “outweigh” the costs of mitigation.
The same features that make the A2 world “non-receptive” to worldwide mitigation policies may exacerbate the climate change effects and prompt nations to act.
Measures such as a rapid shift towards high-tech renewable energy or deep-sea carbon storage will be highly improbable in the A2 world as a consequence of technology limitations.
Instead, such relatively low-tech measures as limiting energy consumption, and capturing and using methane from natural gas systems, coal mining, and landfills better fit the A2 world’s economic and technological profile.
The lack of global co-operation may cause rather large regional variations in the feasibility and cost of mitigation policies and measures.
The B1 world is also well equipped to formulate and implement mitigation strategies, in view of its high economic growth and willingness to co-operate at a global scale.
In comparison with the A1 world, however, it will be confronted with higher marginal abatement costs, although total costs are much lower than in A1B or A1FI.
This is because baseline carbon emissions are lower in the B1 world compared to the A1 world, a consequence of the emphasis on sustainable development in B1.
There will be intense monitoring and reporting of emissions and climate change.
The precautionary principle informs international agenda setting and policy formulation, with governments taking responsibility for climate change-related preventive and adaptive action.
Tightening international standards generates incentives for further innovation towards energy-efficiency and low- and zero-carbon options.
Educational campaigns are another important instrument.
Developed regions support the less developed regions in a variety of ways, including transfer of energy-efficiency and renewable-energy related technologies.
Carbon taxes are introduced; an elaborate phase-in mechanism for less developed regions is negotiated and implemented.
A part of the carbon tax revenue is used to compensate some fossil-fuel exporters and for a fund to compensate those affected by climate change.
In the B2 scenario actions to reduce GHG emissions are taken mainly at a local or regional scale in response to climate change impacts.
Environmentally aware citizens of the B2 world will increasingly attribute damages to human-induced climate change.
High-income countries, which are generally less vulnerable to climate change impacts, will increasingly see the need for climate policy action as a consequence of cost-benefit analyses.
With increasing costs of damage, counter-measures challenge existing energy sector policies and institutional frameworks.
Generally high educational levels promote both development and environmental protection.
Resource availability, economic development, and technical change are uneven over regions.
In relative terms, R&D expenditures are expected to stay constant, but they will be more targeted towards cleaner and less carbon-intensive energy technologies.
Existing bilateral trade links will foster bilateral technology transfer from OECD countries to some developing countries.
This is because rapidly increasing energy and, in particular, electricity demand in developing countries present business opportunities no longer available in OECD countries.
Therefore, there exist a number of incentives for bilateral environmental policy co-operation between R&D intensive countries in the North and developing countries of the South.
Energy trade links, first for oil and later for natural gas and methanol, will play an important seed role for new environmental bilateral co-operation, leading to a regionally heterogeneous approach to GHG reduction.

What can scientific, technical, and socio-economic analyses contribute to the determination of what constitutes dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system as referred to in Article 2 of the Framework Convention on Climate Change?
"The ultimate objective of this Convention and any related legal instruments that the Conference of the Parties may adopt is to achieve, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Convention, stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.
Such a level should be achieved within a time-frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner.
"
Natural, technical, and social sciences can provide essential information and evidence needed for decisions on what constitutes "dangerous anthropogenic interference" with the climate system.
At the same time, such decisions are value judgments determined through socio-political processes, taking into account considerations such as development, equity, and sustainability, as well as uncertainties and risk.
Scientific evidence helps to reduce uncertainty and increase knowledge, and can serve as an input for considering precautionary measures.
The basis for determining what constitutes "dangerous anthropogenic interference" will vary among regions, depending both on the local nature and consequences of climate change impacts, and also on the adaptive capacity available to cope with climate change.
It also depends upon mitigative capacity, since the magnitude and the rate of change are both important.
The consequent types of adaptation responses that will be selected depend on the effectiveness of various adaptation or mitigation responses in reducing vulnerabilities and improving the sustainability of life-support systems.
There is no universally applicable best set of policies; rather, it is important to consider both the robustness of different policy measures against a range of possible future worlds, and the degree to which such climate-specific policies can be integrated with broader sustainable development policies.
The Third Assessment Report (TAR) provides an assessment of new scientific information and evidence as an input for policy makers in their determination of what constitutes "dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system" with regard to: (1) the magnitudes and rates of changes in the climate system, (2) the ecological and socio-economic impacts of climate change, and (3) the potential for achieving a broad range of levels of concentrations through mitigation and information about how adaptation can reduce vulnerability.
With regard to the magnitudes and rates of changes in the climate system, the TAR provides scenario-based projections of future concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, global and regional patterns of changes and rates of change in temperature, precipitation, and sea level, and changes in extreme climate events.
It also examines possibilities for abrupt and irreversible changes in ocean circulation and the major ice sheets.
The TAR reviews the biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change.
The TAR articulates five reasons for concern, regarding:
Of great significance here is an assessment of the likelihood of the critical thresholds at which natural and human systems exhibit large-scale, abrupt, or irreversible changes in their response to a changing climate.
Since no single indicator (e. g., a monetary unit) captures the range of relevant risks presented by climate change, a variety of analytical approaches and criteria are required to assess impacts and facilitate decisions about risk management.
STOCKHOLM (AFP) – The drought in Russia and floods in Pakistan are part of a global trend of unpredictable weather patterns and rainfall that threaten food security, experts gathered in Stockholm said.
"We are getting to a point where we are getting more water, more rainy days, but it's more variable, so it leads to droughts and it leads to floods," Sunita Narain, the head of the Centre for Science and Environment in India, told AFP on the sidelines of the World Water Week conference.
"That is leading to huge amounts of stress on agriculture and livelihoods," she said, adding that "climate change is making rainfall even more variable.
"
Her comments came as eight million people in Pakistan remain dependent on handouts for their survival after monsoons caused devastating floods throughout the country.
Russia is also still struggling with the aftermath of its hottest summer on record, during which drought and fires destroyed a quarter of the country's crops and prompted the government to slap a highly controversial ban on grain exports to protect domestic supplies.
"Millions of farmers in communities dependent on rain-fed agriculture are at risk from decreasing and erratic availability of water," head of the Sri Lanka-based International Water Management Institute (IWMI) Colin Chartres said in a statement.
Some 66 percent of total crops in Asia are not irrigated, while in Africa a full 94 percent is rain-fed, according to the institute, which estimates that around 500 million people in Africa and India would benefit from improved agricultural water management.
"Climate change will lead to different weather patterns, and that is what we are already seeing in many places like Pakistan and Russia.
It doesn't rain the way it used to," he told AFP.
While accepting that the world has recently experienced extreme weather shifts, Jan Lundqvist, who chairs the Stockholm International Water Institute's Scientific Programme Committee, is wary on blaming global warming.
Pointing out that there have been periods of extreme weather patterns before, he said: "These kinds of fluctuations are part of human history, but climate change is probably making them more extreme.
"
As the atmosphere changes, the patterns of winds and particularly the Jet Stream also change.
What we are seeing are massive changes in the Jet Stream.
In the end, it doesn't matter if it's caused by 'man-caused global warming', 'natural climatic fluctuations', or god playing dice with the environment.
It's a very big problem and it's going to get worse because we have altered the natural balance of the world so much.
When essential water become scarce or doesn't come at all, or when it comes all at once so that it runs off destroying the productive land as it goes; when previously fertile group becomes swamps or baked deserts....it sets the scenario for violent conflict as people try to survive just another day.
No country or people are going to be immune to the results.
The term climate change was actually coined by Frank Luntz, a Republican strategist.
Today, he admits that man made global warming is a serious issue that needs to be addressed.
- Why are creationist organizations such as the Discovery Group also involved with the denialist campaign against global warming?
The growers will have to reapply fertilizer after every smaller flood, which they can not possibly afford.
Additionally, limestone to correct acidity caused by too much washout will be necessary at additional cost.
Many more will starve, as we will be addressing our own weather problems here.
This policy of ignorance will have a bad ending
Whether or not we want to say Global Warming is the culprit, the bottom line is the water wars are starting.
With less and less food security we are going to see many more wars and violence.
Perhaps its time to revisit the removal of some of the dams that are stopping the flow of water down stream.
The IMF and WTO should look at funding the removal of at least ten major dams.
The alternative costs to world security and human suffering will be much higher than the cost of dam removal.
Just a thought.

A planet's climate is decided by its mass, its distance from the sun and the composition of its atmosphere.
Mars is too small to keep a thick atmosphere.
Its atmosphere consists mainly of carbon dioxide, but the atmosphere is very thin.
The atmosphere of the Earth is a hundred times thicker.
Over the last 400,000 years the Earth's climate has been unstable, with very significant temperature changes, going from a warm climate to an ice age in as rapidly as a few decades.
These rapid changes suggest that climate may be quite sensitive to internal or external climate forcings and feedbacks.
concentrations in the atmosphere have been measured at an altitude of about 4,000 meters on the peak of Mauna Loa mountain in Hawaii since 1958.
In 1988, UNEP and WMO jointly established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as concern over climate change became a political issue.
The purpose of the IPCC was to assess the state of knowledge on the various aspects of climate change including science, environmental and socio-economic impacts and response strategies.
The potential impacts of climate change on the environment and socio-economic systems can be understood in terms of sensitivity, adaptability and vulnerability of the system.

But before you do print, think about the environment!
Climate change is a complex issue, but it can be summarized rather simply: the consensus of science is that global warming is a threat (1); the consensus of economics is that a carbon tax would be a cost-effective remedy (2).
A carbon tax is a charge for emitting carbon dioxide (CO2), the main heat-trapping culprit.
For the last several years Ecological Internet has proposed a small U.S. government federal charge initially of $5 per ton of carbon emitted as CO2, which for gasoline is about 1 cent per gallon.
Since Lincoln's portrait appears on both the penny and the $5 bill, the plan goes under his name - the "Lincoln Plan".
A fundamental question in addressing climate change is whether cap-and-trade or a carbon tax would be more cost-effective.
For a discussion of this matter, please see the following articles: Limiting Carbon Dioxide Emissions: Prices Versus Caps and After Kyoto: Alternative Mechanisms to Control Global Warming .
Over 100% of the carbon tax revenue coming from the public would be returned to the public as dividends.
95% of the corporate revenue stream would be used to cut corporate income taxes; and nearly 5% would fund forest protection, energy efficiency, and clean energy supplies.
The plan would thus tax pollution rather than employment and savings.
Further boosting the plan's attractiveness would be its considerable side benefits.
Saving forests, particularly tropical forests (3), would help safeguard the majority of Earth's species; efficiency gains could save us a lot of money (4) while reducing dependence upon overseas sources of energy; and moving to cleaner energy supplies would reduce harmful pollutants of many kinds.
Indeed, these ancillary benefits are so large that the plan would be worth trying even apart from its core benefit of climate protection.
Sensible climate protection should, indeed, be profitable.
As Amory Lovins writes , "If properly done, climate protection would actually reduce costs, not raise them.
Using energy more efficiently offers an economic bonanza...because saving fossil fuel is a lot cheaper than buying it.
"
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has long said that a carbon tax would be the most cost-effective policy instrument for controlling climate change.
And now, advances in technology, e.g.
here [ http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2009/natural-gas.html ], may allow a CO2 price which rises just $1/ton each quarter for three years, and each year after that.

), in more detail.
Carbon dioxide is a colourless, odourless gas.
Its present day atmospheric concentration is approximately 367 ppmv (parts per million by volume).
It is the principal anthropogenic contributor to the greenhouse effect, and there has been a major increase in the amount of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere over the past 200 years.
The suspected main cause for the increase in atmospheric concentrations of this gas has been man-made emissions since the Industrial Revolution from processes such as fossil fuel combustion.
What are the sources of carbon dioxide?
This section looks at the sources of carbon dioxide, with particular emphasis on the anthropogenic or man-made sources, which are of particular relevance to global warming.
Carbon dioxide is produced naturally through the process of respiration, the decay of plant and animal matter, and natural forest fires.
However, there are many anthropogenic sources of carbon dioxide.
For example fossil fuel combustion, land use changes and cement manufacture are all major anthropogenic sources of CO
Fossil fuel combustion: fossil fuels contain large quantities of carbon.
When they are burnt, this carbon is released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, leading to an increase in its atmospheric concentration.
The amount of CO
Land use changes: changes in the use of land, as a result of deforestation, have had a major impact on the amount of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere.
Trees and plants absorb carbon dioxide during the process of photosynthesis, and the carbon is stored in the tissue and wood fibre of the tree.
The large scale clearing of many of the world's forested areas, such as the Amazonian rainforest and the rainforests of Malaysia, for agricultural and industrial purposes, has reduced the amount of CO
that is being absorbed by vegetation, allowing more carbon dioxide to be retained in the atmosphere.
In addition, the burning or gradual decay of the timber products releases CO
).
During the manufacturing process large quantities of carbon dioxide are released from the limestone into the atmosphere.
What are the sinks of carbon dioxide?
A sink is a method by which a gas is removed from the atmosphere.
This section outlines the principal sinks for carbon dioxide, i.e.
its absorption by the oceans and terrestrial biota (for example forests).
The oceans contain about 95% of the carbon actively circulating within the biosphere.
Carbon dioxide is dissolved within the ocean and it also reacts with the chemical constituents in the water.
Scientists believe that a large proportion of the carbon dioxide that has been released into the atmosphere will eventually be held within the oceans.
However, the cycling of carbon within the ocean is a slow process that can take between 100-1000 years, so the absorption of CO
by the oceans is not keeping pace with the amount of carbon dioxide that is being emitted.
There is also scientific concern that if the predicted climate changes occur, this will affect the natural exchange of carbon between the ocean and the atmosphere and consequentially the uptake of carbon dioxide by the oceans.
(An increase in the temperature of the oceans because of global warming would decrease the solubility of CO
How much carbon dioxide is in the atmosphere?
The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has been steadily increasing since the 18th Century, most likely as a result of human activity.
Pupils may graph the rise in the amount of CO
The pre-industrial concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was 280 ppmv (parts per million by volume).
By 1999 this had increased to 367 ppmv, an increase of about 30% on the pre-industrial value.
Since 1957, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has been monitored at Mauna Loa in Hawaii in the eastern Pacific Ocean.
The station has recorded an increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide of 1.2 ppmv or 0.3% per year.
This rise can mainly be attributed to anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide, since the concentration would not change so quickly under normal circumstances.
How long does carbon dioxide remain in the atmosphere?
could remain in the atmosphere for up to two centuries before it is removed by various reactions, thereby increasing the importance of CO
The time taken for atmospheric gases to adjust to changes in sources or sinks is known as the atmospheric lifetime of a gas.
The atmospheric lifetime of carbon dioxide is in the order of 50-200 years.
As a consequence of this, CO
emitted into the atmosphere today could influence the atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide for up to two centuries to come.
The Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has predicted that if anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide continue at present day levels, the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide could have increased to 415-480 ppmv by 2050, rising to 460-560 ppmv by 2100.
What can be done to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere?
Scientific concern over the contribution to global warming of increasing CO
concentrations has led to an international response.
Of particular concern is the growth in energy derived from fossil fuels.
This section introduces the international agreements signed to help reduce carbon dioxide levels in future years.
In 1992 the IPCC estimated that in order to stabilise carbon dioxide emissions at present day levels a 60% reduction in global carbon dioxide emissions would be required.
Since the problem of global warming was first highlighted there have been attempts by international governments to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases and try and solve the potential problem of global warming.
The most important such attempt to limit our rapidly increasing carbon dioxide emissions is The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC)
The Framework Convention on Climate Change was signed at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, by over 150 Governments.
The Convention requires all countries that ratify the Treaty to produce a national programme, outlining measures that will limit the amount of greenhouse gases produced and improve methods for protecting the sinks for carbon dioxide such as the forests and vegetation.
The developed countries were committed to return their emissions of greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by the year 2000.
Developed countries also provided financial and technological assistance to allow the developing nations to produce their own programmes on emission reductions.
In 1997, the Kyoto Protocol called for developed nations to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by 5% by 2012.
This Protocol will become legally binding when enough countries have ratified it.
The UK Climate Change Programme is the UK Government's action plan for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
The UK Programme goes further than the FCCC and Kyoto Protocol, by calling for a 20% reduction in national carbon dioxide emissions by 2010 (from 1990 levels).
This reduction is being achieved through a number of measures, including increased energy awareness, VAT on fuel, energy efficiency and alternative energy sources.
Emissions of carbon dioxide in the UK are currently predicted to fall by 15% by 2010 with existing measures.

Within the notes for pupils is a table of atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide.
This data can be used to produce a graph similar to the figure shown below.
Which areas are most severely affected by deforestation?
Why do they release carbon dioxide when they are burnt?
Ozone is a form of oxygen.
Oxygen exists in three different forms in the atmosphere.
Ozone is also an effective greenhouse gas (see Lesson One).
Oxygen atoms (O) are the simplest form of oxygen.
The atoms exist as separate units; much of the oxygen in the highest part of the atmosphere exists in this form.
) are the most common form in which oxygen exists in the troposphere (lower atmosphere), and is the form of oxygen we breathe.
Without ozone, there would be no life on Earth.
Ozone protects us by forming a shield against harmful radiation from the Sun, known as ultraviolet (UV) radiation.
Ultraviolet forms a part of the electromagnetic spectrum between violet and X-rays; it is just outside the range of visible light, with a frequency higher than violet (Figure 1).
There are three categories of ultraviolet radiation: UV-A, UV-B and UV-C. Although we cannot see UV radiation, it does have an effect on our bodies.
UV-A is the least damaging form of UV radiation and reaches the Earth in the greatest quantities.
This is the UV light responsible for the tanning and ageing processes of the skin.
UV-B is potentially harmful, but most of it is absorbed by the ozone in the stratosphere.
Prolonged exposure to UV-B light can cause sunburn, and there are worries that damage to the ozone layer may lead to an increase in the incidence of skin cancer.
UV-C is the most damaging form of UV radiation.
Fortunately most UV-C is absorbed by the ozone and oxygen in the stratosphere.
Without the ozone layer the harmful UV rays would reach the Earth's surface and cause serious damage to living things.
There would be a dramatic increase in the cases of skin cancer and eye cataracts.
UV radiation can also make it harder for our bodies to fight off some diseases.
An increase in UV radiation would also affect parts of the food chain.
UV is very damaging to plankton in the oceans.
Plankton are an important source of food for many of the creatures that live in the sea such as fish and whales.
An increase in the amount of UV radiation reaching the Earth's surface is estimated to diminish plankton supplies.
If fish do not have enough plankton to eat they may die, and other species may become endangered.
This would, in turn, affect the whole food chain.
Ozone can be found in both the troposphere and the stratosphere.
Ozone formed in the troposphere is known as ground-level ozone.
It is an ingredient in smog and is also a damaging pollutant.
It is unusual that a substance which is totally undesirable as a constituent of the air we breathe should be so important high up in the atmosphere (in the stratosphere).
Ground level ozone is formed by the action of sunlight on carbon based chemicals known as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in combination with a group of pollutants called nitrogen oxides (NO
Ground level ozone is a pollutant that can cause health problems (such as breathing difficulties).
Ground level ozone can also damage materials such as rubber or plastic and vegetation.
Ground level ozone is an important component of photochemical smog, which is a problem mainly associated with large industrial cities, for example Los Angeles and Athens.
The concentration of ground level ozone has increased rapidly over the past few decades, due to an increase in the number of cars and other vehicles on the road.
Nitrogen oxides are a by-product of combustion from power stations and vehicle exhausts.
They are also produced from natural sources such as volcanic eruptions and lightning.
90% of ozone is contained within the stratosphere; it is more commonly known as the ozone layer.
Stratospheric ozone plays an important part in filtering out most of the ultraviolet radiation that reaches the Earth.
Ozone in the stratosphere is not a pollutant, and does not contribute to the greenhouse effect.
Ozone has very different effects, depending on where in the atmosphere it is.
The formation of stratospheric ozone is shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2: The formation of stratospheric ozone
Ozone depletion occurs when the natural balance between the processes of stratospheric ozone production and destruction is disturbed, resulting in more ozone being destroyed than is being produced.
The main cause of ozone depletion is thought to be a group of compounds containing chlorine and bromine.
These 'ozone depleters' act by removing one oxygen atom from the ozone molecule, so converting it into an oxygen molecule.
Each atom of chlorine or bromine can destroy many thousands of ozone molecules in this way.
Compounds which contain chlorine do not occur naturally in the upper atmosphere.
However over the past 100 years the amount of man-made compounds containing chlorine and bromine has increased, and this has led to a decrease in natural ozone levels.
There are a number of compounds that have led to an increase in the amount of chlorine and bromine in the atmosphere:
Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) do not exist naturally, but are man-made compounds containing chlorine, fluorine and carbon.
Production of CFCs began in the 1930s when they were first used in fridges.
After the Second World War however, the amount of CFCs being produced increased as they were also used in aerosols, air conditioning units and for various other purposes.
When CFCs were first developed they were thought of as safe, inert gases with numerous uses and believed to cause minimal environmental damage.
CFCs, when released from the surface of the Earth, rise slowly into the stratosphere.
Once there, they are bombarded by the incoming UV light from the Sun, releasing the chlorine atoms from the parent compound, which can then react with the ozone molecules (Figure 3).
Eventually the chlorine atom is removed from the atmosphere by other reactions.
Figure 3: The destruction of stratospheric ozone
Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs).
These chemicals are made up of hydrogen, chlorine, fluorine and carbon.
They were developed as an alternative to CFCs and are now used in place of them in many products.
HCFCs do deplete the ozone layer but they have a shorter atmospheric lifetime than CFCs so they don't cause as much damage.
However, HCFCs are powerful greenhouse gases.
Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are another replacement for CFCs.
They are made up of hydrogen, fluorine and carbon.
HFCs are thought to do very little damage to the ozone layer, but they are powerful greenhouse gases.
Halons are used in fire extinguishers.
They are similar to CFCs but instead of chlorine they contain bromine and they are powerful ozone depleters.
The ozone layer is being depleted faster in some areas of the world than others.
Near the equator, ozone levels have hardly changed.
Over the South Pole the concentration of stratospheric ozone drops by 60% every spring, compared to measurements made in the 1970s.
This happens due to the special meteorological conditions over Antarctica.
The 'hole' is therefore a thinning of the ozone layer, rather than its complete destruction (Figure 4).
Very few people live in Antarctica, but the hole is of particular concern to people living nearby, in places like South America or New Zealand.
Figure 4: The Antarctic Ozone Hole (DU = Dobson Units)
What is being done to stop ozone depletion?
The Montreal Protocol is an international agreement that was designed to control the amount of CFCs and other ozone-depleting chemicals being produced, and eventually stop production of such chemicals altogether.
It was first drawn up in 1987; since then over 120 countries have signed it.
The Protocol agreed that CFCs should be phased out by the year 1995, and that production of HCFCs and methyl bromide should be reduced and eventually eliminated (by 2029).
Emissions of CFCs and other ozone-depleting chemicals have now fallen dramatically as a result, but because of the long atmospheric lifetime of CFC molecules in the atmosphere, ozone depletion will continue to be a problem for many years.
What you can do to help protect the ozone layer?
There are also many steps you can take to protect the ozone layer:
Increased levels of UV-B reaching the Earth through a depleted ozone layer will put people more at risk from developing skin cancer and eye cataracts.
There are many things you can do to protect yourself, a few of these are listed below:
1.
Describe how the world might look without the ozone layer to protect it from the damaging rays of the Sun.
In 1905 Dr HA Des Voeux used the term smog to describe conditions of fuliginous or sooty / smoky fogs.
Smog occurs as a result of particular meteorological conditions in which smoke particles from the domestic and industrial burning of coal became trapped in fog.
Fog and smoke frequencies began to reduce in the UK urban areas during the early 1900s, compared with the latter half of the nineteenth century.
Air pollution was still a severe problem but the number of major smogs began to decrease.
Several changes helped contribute to this situation, including:
The graph shows the average smoke and sulphur dioxide levels for 12 London sites and the relationship with deaths recorded during the smog period in December 1952.
The peak in the number of death coincided with the peak in both smoke and sulphur dioxide pollution levels.
The Government could not ignore the Great London Smog and so the first Clean Air Act was eventually introduced in 1956, following the Beaver Committee Report.
This Act aimed to control domestic sources of smoke pollution by introducing smokeless zones.
In these areas, smokeless fuels had to be burnt.
The Clean Air Act focused on reducing smoke pollution but the measures taken actually helped to reduce sulphur dioxide levels at the same time.
Air pollution in cities dramatically reduced in the following ways.
The Clean Air Act of 1968 brought in the basic principle for the use of tall chimneys for industries burning coal, liquid or gaseous fuels.
At the time of this legislation it was recognised that smoke pollution could be controlled, but that sulphur dioxide removal was generally impracticable.
Hence, the higher the chimney, the better the dispersal of the air pollution.
Urban air quality improved following the Clean Air Acts.
In particular, the smoke, grit and dust that arose from industrial and domestic sources due to coal burning had been controlled through the introduction of smokeless zones and the controls imposed on industries to reduced their particulate emissions.
The transport related problems that we are experiencing now will be made worse by the projected increase in UK traffic.
The Department for Transport's (DfT) 10 Year Plan projects an increase in vehicle traffic of 17% from 2000 to 2010 (compared to 21% without the Plan).
Road traffic and hence vehicle pollution, tends to be greatest in urban areas.
The impacts of exhaust emissions include acid deposition and air pollution, human health effects, global climate change and noise pollution.
Since the 1950s, emissions from aircraft have been increasing, posing yet further problems for the environment, both local and global.
Today, the growth in air transport is faster than that witnessed for land-based vehicles.
) and lead.
Table 1 shows the UK emissions of these pollutants in 1999.
Individually, a vehicle engine is not a particularly important source of pollution.
Collectively however, they represent a major source of air pollutants in the UK.
O).
However, at low loads engines are inefficient and therefore the products of incomplete combustion dominate, for example CO and VOCs in petrol engines and carbon monoxide, VOCs and smoke in diesels.
As the temperature of combustion increases, the efficiency of conversion to CO
Buses are generally recognised as an environmentally friendly form of transport, particularly in relation to the number of car journeys needed to carry the equivalent number of passengers.
A bus uses less fuel per person carried and hence produces less pollution than the number of cars it replaces.
However, buses do contribute to air quality problems, particularly in cities.
Improvements in the emission performance of buses are likely to be needed in the future.
.
However, diesel engines emit larger volumes of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) than petrol engines and most importantly, far larger emissions of particulate matter and black smoke.
The black smoke component of particulate matter is almost wholly due to diesel emissions and is responsible for the soiling of buildings.
Fine particulate matter is also associated with visibility degradation and has been linked with a range of adverse health effects.
Air transport is one of the world's fastest growing energy use sectors.
Most international travel is by air and domestic air travel in developed countries is expanding.
Furthermore, whilst per capita demand for air transport is currently very low in poor populous countries, it has the potential to grow considerably.
Whilst historically noise has been the major environmental issue associated with airports and aircraft, local and global effects of aircraft emissions on air quality are beginning to dominate the environmental agenda.
Although technological advances are helping to reduce emissions, the continued growth in emissions is expected to rise in line with predicted growth in air traffic movements.
Emissions can arise from different modes of aircraft operation, namely idle, taxi, take-off, approach and landing.
The mode of operation puts differing demands on the aircraft engines resulting in fluctuating pollution emissions.
For example carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons, which arise from incomplete or poor combustion, are generally largest during taxi / idle operations.
(Many hydrocarbons are odorous; the typical airport smell of unburned and partially burned kerosene is testament to this.
) Emissions of NOx, however, are generated largely by the oxidation of atmospheric nitrogen in the combustion process.
As such their production is proportional to the combustion temperature, and emissions of NOx are therefore at their highest during the take-off phase when the engine is generally producing maximum power.
Emissions of carbon dioxide are directly related to the amount of fuel burned.
During the landing phase the combustion is delivering some 30% power; at such a setting NOx is still an important pollutant, whilst CO and hydrocarbon emissions become increasingly important as the combustion thrust output falls.
Since the early 1800s, pollution problems have largely resulted from industry and domestic heating, principally due to sulphur dioxide.
In recent years, however, the transport sector has become the most significant source of both primary pollutants, such as nitrogen dioxide, and secondary pollutants, like ozone.
This fact sheet investigates the major air pollutants in the United Kingdom, and their health effects.
Particulates may be seen as the more critical of all pollutants, and some estimates have suggested that particulates are responsible for up to 10,000 premature deaths in the UK each year.
The extent to which particulates are considered harmful depends largely on their composition.
Sea salt, for example, is believed to have a positive effect on health.
Man-made sources of particulates, however, are rarely harmless.
In towns and cities, these are extensively from diesel vehicle exhausts.
The effects of particulate emissions are considered detrimental due to their composition, containing mainly unburned fuel oil and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that are known to be carcinogenic among laboratory animals.
Particulates may originate from many other sources including cement manufacturing processes, incineration and power generation, meaning localised instances of particulate pollution are common.
The categorisation of particles through size has recently become important when assessing their effects on health.
Monitoring now exists for PM
Ozone differs from most pollutants in that it is created as a secondary pollutant by the action of sunlight on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and oxides of nitrogen, often over several days.
This results in ozone being widely dispersed as a pollutant, and can form in greater concentrations in rural areas.
As ozone concentrations are particularly dependant on sunlight, episodes are always likely to develop following sustained periods of warmth and calm weather.
Ozone is a toxic gas that can bring irreversible damage to the respiratory tract and lung tissue if delivered in high quantities.
Levels during air pollution episodes have peaked at around 250 ppb.
At these concentrations ozone is likely to impair lung function and cause irritation to the respiratory tract.
Asthmatics are known to adopt these symptoms more easily.
).
The latter is more damaging to health, due to the toxic nature of this gas.
NO is more readily emitted to the atmosphere as a primary pollutant, from traffic and power stations, and is often oxidised to nitrogen dioxide following dispersal.
Health effects of exposure to NO
Transport, tobacco smoke and gas appliances are the major sources of carbon monoxide.
Its link with haemoglobin, the oxygen carrying component of the blood stream, forms carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb) which can be life-threatening in high doses.
The effects of carbon monoxide pollution are more damaging to pregnant women and their foetus.
Research into smoking and pregnancy shows that concentrations within the blood stream of unborn infants is as high as 12%, causing retardation of the unborn child's growth and mental development.
A significant proportion of atmospheric lead comes from traffic emissions, due to the lead content in petrol.
This has been significantly reduced in recent years but lead is still a serious air pollutant especially to those living near to areas of dense traffic in cities where leaded fuel is still used.
Damage to the central nervous system, kidneys and brain can result when levels in the blood reach concentrations of 800 mg/litre.
Much of the concern regarding pollution from lead centres around its effects on child health.
Children exhibit vulnerability to the toxic effects of lead at much lower concentrations than for adults.
It has been shown that there is a strong link between high lead exposures and impaired intelligence.
The health effects of sulphur dioxide pollution were exposed graphically during the "Great Smog" of London in 1952.
This resulted in approximately 4000 premature deaths through heart disease and bronchitis.
Since then, however, emissions have been significantly reduced through legislative measures.
Research has shown that exposure for asthmatics is significantly more damaging than for normal subjects.
Concentrations above 125 ppb may result in a fall in lung function in asthmatics.
Tightness in the chest and coughing may also result at levels approaching 400 ppb.
At levels above 400 ppb the lung function of asthmatics may be impaired to the extent that medical help is required.
There have been several exceedences of levels in Northern Ireland due to the high use of solid fuel (coal) in homes for heating purposes.
Sulphur dioxide pollution is considered more harmful when particulate and other pollution concentrations are high.
This is known as the synergistic effect, or more commonly the "cocktail effect.
" Therefore the monitoring networks in the UK incorporate both smoke and sulphur dioxide.
Some VOCs are quite harmful, including the following: Benzene: may increase susceptibility to leukaemia, if exposure is maintained over a period of time.
Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH): forms of this compound can cause cancer.
There are several hundred different forms of PAH, and sources can be both natural and man-made.
Dioxins: sources of dioxins vary, although the manufacturing of organic compounds as well as the incineration of wastes and various other combustion processes involving chlorinated compounds may also produce dioxins.
Health effects are as much a problem due to ingestion, as inhalation, such is the problem of dioxins entering the food chain from soils.
1,3 Butadiene: there is an apparent correlation between butadiene exposure and a higher risk of cancer.
Sources are manufacturing of synthetic rubbers, petrol driven vehicles and cigarette smoke.
Many different compounds are contained in tobacco smoke, including carbon monoxide, ammonia, dioxins and PAH; the latter two are thought to be carcinogenic.
Other sources of indoor pollution include particulates from mineral fibres as well as household dust.
Dust in buildings is known to cause problems including fatigue and nausea.
One of the most pressing concerns with indoor air pollution is with carbon monoxide build up from gas fired appliances.
There has been a steady rise in the number of reported asthma cases since the 1970s.
Awareness of the disease has been significant in the rising numbers of hospital admissions although air pollution problems are also believed to be significant in the rising number of cases.
High concentrations of nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, ozone and particulates (especially PM
More than 100 responses to the review of the National Air Quality Strategy have been received by DETR.
There have been two common responses throughout; that the Strategy is over complicated and criticism over plans to relax the particulate matter (PM10) pollution objective.
The Environment Agency has described many of the proposals as "unnecessarily complicated and in places ambiguous and confusing".
The National Society for Clean Air in particular have opposed plans to weaken the PM10 objective.
NSCA believe this could "represent a serious retreat from health-based air quality objectives, calling into question the Government's commitment to improve air quality".
The National Air Quality Strategy Review was published in January 1999 and was expected to be widely accepted given that most objectives had been tightened.
However, the critical responses may mean that the review proposals may not be implemented.
The outcome of the Review is expected later this year.
Data on polluting industries can now be accessed on the Internet via the Environment Agency's site which includes a new Pollution Inventory.
The Inventory shows emissions from all processes under integrated pollution control (IPC).
It is possible to create league tables of polluters for different pollutants and to search the database by postcode, industry sector, company name or pollutant.
The inventory data for 1998 for England and Wales has been welcomed by Friends of the Earth who operate a similar database.
The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency have stated that the Environment Agency's pollution inventory "far exceeds" the initial requirements for industrial installation emissions reporting contained in the EU's Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Directive, which will apply to new industrial plants from November.
Edison Mission Energy, a US power company, has bought two coal fired power stations, Fiddler's Ferry and Ferrybridge C, for £1.25 billion.
Plans to invest £200 million in pollution control measures, including flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) have been announced by the new owners.
However, Mission are not planning to completely retrofit all four 500MW units with FGD but may have some FGD capacity at each station.
A new pollution monitoring device - the Learian streetbox - has been endorsed by the Government as a millenium product.
The box is suitable for monitoring roadside pollution, typically monitoring carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide as well as meteorological parameters.
The streetbox can operate for 400 days on its own batteries and is therefore useful for sites away from mains supplies and telephone links.
Pollution levels are transmitted via a radio link up to five kilometres away.
For further information contact Leardes (Tel: 01252 523292).
An American study which commenced in 1977 has shown a link between ozone pollution and lung cancer.
Six thousand white non-smoking Seventh Day Adventists have been followed up on incidence of lung cancers.
The exposure of persons to ozone and other pollutants was calculated using postcode-based pollution concentration maps and data of hours spent at work and home.
Strong correlations between ozone and lung cancer in males were found.
Researchers believe this is because the males tended to spend much more time outdoors in the summer than the females, when ozone pollution is at its highest.
Associations were found at concentrations of ozone as low as 80ppb.
In the same study, researchers claim to have found a causal link between ozone and asthma.
Many studies have in the past shown that ozone aggravates asthma but not that it causes asthma.
This study found a significant relationship between 20-year ozone exposures and newly reported cases of asthma in males but not in females.
This suggests that cumulative exposure to low levels (60ppb) of ozone may be related to the development of new cases of asthma.
A study by the London Research Centre of the Greater Belfast Atmospheric Emissions Inventory has shown that domestic sources are responsible for high levels of sulphur dioxide.
The Belfast area has traditionally relied on coal and oil for domestic heating although emissions of sulphur dioxide are likely to start decreasing as natural gas is becoming more widely available.
During the last century the earth as a whole has been warming, but the Northern Hemisphere has experienced the greatest increase in temperature.
This has been primarily linked to changes in atmospheric circulation that may be related to increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
Evidence that man-made emissions of greenhouse gases are responsible for increasing the temperature of the earth is now becoming available.
A climate model at the Hadley Centre (Bracknell UK) has shown that temperature changes during this century cannot be explained by any combination of natural variability alone.
It can be explained as the climate's response to the changes in man-made greenhouse gas emissions.
A continued temperature increase throughout the world could have profound effects.
Ocean ecosystems are already being effected by climate change according to a report by the Marine Conservation Biology Institute and the World Wildlife Fund.
The report suggests that an increase in ocean temperatures may be responsible for the rapid decline in Pacific Salmon over the last few years.
Salmon metabolism increases as temperatures rise and this can lead to mortality in winter when food is scarce.
It is thought that a doubling of carbon dioxide levels will remove all suitable habitats for the Pacific Salmon.
The researchers believe that the explanation for this is climate related.
The overall distribution of birds in the UK is correlated with temperature and the northerly shifts coincide with a period of climate warming.
IMPACTS OF AVIATION ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND OZONE
A new report published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) looks at the effects that the continued growth of the Global Aviation Industry could have on Global Climate Change.
The growth could cause a fourfold increase in aviation's contribution to climate change by 2050.
Aviation and the Global Environment examines the impacts of aircraft emissions on climate change and ozone depletion through a range of predicted growth scenarios.
In 1992, emissions of carbon dioxide (CO
In March 1999, the UK Energy Minister, John Battle set out the Government's blueprint for the future development of renewables.
£43 million will be spent over the next 3 years on research and the development of renewable energy.
Mr. Battle said that the new paper "New and Renewable Energy - Prospects for 21st Century" shows that there is a great deal of potential for the use of renewables in the UK.
At present only 2% of electricity in the UK is produced by renewables.
With the Government's support it is hoped that this figure will rise to 5% by 2003 and 10% by 2010.
This could lead to a reduction of 5 million tones of UK carbon dioxide emissions.
This would make a valuable contribution to the UK climate change strategy.
The Environment Minister, Michael Meacher, has launched a new information booklet on UK Acidification.
Meacher commented that although many people see acid rain as a problem of the past, in fact acid rain continues to threaten Sites of Special Scientific Interest and other habitats in the UK.
The UK is committed to reducing sulphur dioxide emissions by 80% by 2010, using 1980 levels as a baseline.
Mr. Meacher described these commitments as realistic and ambitious and said that government and industry both had a role to play in reducing pollution emissions.
However, Mr. Meacher also stressed that individuals can also help by doing their bit.
(The phrase Are you doing your bit?
is part of the Government environmental awareness campaign).
The booklet Acidification in the UK highlights that whilst sulphur deposition has reduced significantly throughout Europe over the last decade, oxides of nitrogen and ammonia emissions have not reduced by the same extent.
Recovery processes in soil and freshwater are generally slow but major decreases in acidification damage are expected by 2010.
However, further emission cuts are likely to be required to protect the most sensitive areas.

The 1999 Hall of Shame list of polluters, published by the Environment Agency, names ICI as the worst offender with a total of £382 500 in fines for 1998.
The Agency's chief executive expressed concern that tough action by the Environment Agency was not being matched by tough enough penalties being imposed by courts.
The average fine for 1998 was less than £3,000.
The largest fine was £300,000 for ICI for accidentally releasing 150 tonnes of chloroform into groundwater and the atmosphere around Runcorn, Cheshire.
The US manufacturer Engelhard is to market a new diesel exhaust after treatment device in the UK.
The device reduces particulates and other pollutants and is likely to bring strong competition for Eminox, the main competitor on the market.
The Engelhard DPX catalysts will cost £3,000, compared to a cost of £3500+ for the Eminox CRT (a similar device that requires the use of ultra low sulphur diesel).
The British government has handed out a total of £4m Environmental Action Fund grants to 120 environmental and community organisations.
The Atmospheric Research and Information Centre (ARIC) will receive £26,000 for the Atmospheric, Climate and Environment Information Programme, whilst the National Society of Clean Air and Environmental Protection (NSCA) will receive £30,000 toward work on air pollution, sustainable information and a noise pollution education pack.
In 1997 countries around the world drew up the Kyoto Protocol, an extension of the Framework Convention on Climate Change, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in all countries that ratify it.
As of 15th March, a year after the Protocol opened for signature, 84 countries have signed the agreement.
The Protocol, however, only becomes legally binding once at least 55 countries, including industrial nations accounting for 55% of global carbon dioxide emissions, have ratified it.
To date, only 7 countries, all of them small island or low-lying countries threatened by sea level rise have ratified the Protocol.
1998 was recorded as the warmest year to date in the observational record of surface temperatures.
According to a report in the 15th March issue of Geophysical Research Letters (vol.
26, pp.
1759-1762), 1998 may also be the warmest year of the past 1000 years.
Extending previous research that showed the 20th century was the warmest of the past six centuries, Michael Mann of the University of Massachusetts and colleagues analysed tree ring and ice core back to AD 1000.
The analysis showed that there was a cooling in surface temperature until around 1900 of 0.2°C per century, followed by a dramatic temperature rise.
Thomas Peterson of the National Climatic Data Center (Ashville, North Caroliner, USA) and colleagues have used data from the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) to show that global warming is not biased by urban warming.
Many temperature-recording stations are based in urban areas and hence skeptics have suggested that urban warming has skewed overall temperature trends.
In March, the UK Department of the Environment, Transport and The Regions (DETR) announced a new programme of research to protect and enhance the environment.
The new research programme for 1999-2000 includes a further £1.5 million on top of last year, in addition to research funded by the Environment Agency.
The DETR is inviting expressions of research interest in the fields of global atmosphere, air and environment quality, and noise.
In particular, greater emphasis is being placed on research which supports the ongoing development of the National Air Quality Strategy.
In March the UK Round Table on Sustainable Development published its 4th annual report.
The UK Round Table on Sustainable Development was established by the Government in 1995.
It aims to encourage discussion on major sustainable development issues.
Its members are drawn from business, environmental organisations, local government and other sectors of the community.
Its latest annual report, available from the Department of the Environment, Transport and The Regions (Zone 4/D10) or on the Internet at: http://www.open.gov.uk/roundtbl/hometb.htm covers a range of topics including biodiversity, agriculture and rural policy, involvement of stakeholders and regional issues.
Whilst Greenpeace have unveiled a report produced by BTM Consult Aps suggesting that 10% of global electricity consumption by 2017 could be generated by wind power, plans for a large windfarm in the Yorkshire Dales (UK) have been rejected following a public inquiry.
Consisting of 25 wind turbines, each over 50 metres in height, the development proposal was deemed to be "unacceptable" by the National Park planners because of the visual impact it would have on the landscape.
Proposals have been published to amend the National Air Quality Strategy.
In the Review, five pollutant standards are to be toughened whilst particulates (PM10) are to be relaxed.
The Review of the National Air Quality Strategy is a consultation document; final policy is expected by the end of this year.
A summary of the proposed changes for the eight pollutants is given below:
Copies of the Review of the National Air Quality Strategy can be obtained from DETR Free Literature, Tel: 0870 122 6236, Fax: 0870 1226237 or via the Internet
Westminster City Council has declared the whole borough an Air Quality Management Area, being the first London Borough to do so.
The council believes that emissions of particulates and nitrogen dioxide will not meet the 2005 objectives set in the National Air Quality Strategy.
Action plans in Westminster are likely to include setting up a low emission zone in which vehicles that fail to meet emission standards are banned.
This initiative is intended to reduce travelling time, reduce fuel consumption and reduce air pollution.
The service is also available by freephone.
Traffic Assist can be accessed at the following Internet address:
Belfast is the UK's hotspot for smoke and sulphur dioxide pollution.
In 1996, the 15 minute mean for sulphur dioxide was exceeded 666 times at one Belfast site and 338 times at another, compared to 97 exceedences at the worst English site.
In an attempt to reduce emissions from the major source in Northern Ireland - large-scale domestic use of solid fuel, new regulations are seeking to limit the sale of solid fuels with a sulphur content of more than 2%.
The sale or delivery of non-authorised fuels is also to be prohibited in smoke control areas.
For the first time satellite measurements of surface temperature appear to be in agreement with the ground-based measurements.
Until now data from satellites have been used by global warming skeptics to refute the existence of a warming trend.
However, the 12-month global average temperature from December 1997 to November 1998 was 0.465°C above the 1982-1991 baseline temperature.
In February, Michael Meacher, the UK Environment Minister, announced that top UK companies have pledged to report on their greenhouse gas emissions and their effect on climate change.
The Minister was keen to stress that reporting need not be 'glossy', but instead innovative and cost-effective, for example via the Internet.
The draft guidance has been given early backing by a number of companies, including Wessex Water, Severn Trent, Anglian Water, Tarmac, Eastern Electricity, Railtrack, Boots, Cable & Wireless and NatWest.
In January, one of the most respected scientific bodies in the world, the American Geophysical Union (AGU), consisting of 35,000 members representing a broad range of earth sciences, released its position statement on climate change.
The AGU argue that although the "increase in global average surface temperature over the last 150 years appears to be unusual in the context of the last few centuries, it is not clearly outside the range of [natural] climate variability of the last few thousand years".
Nevertheless, "there is no known geological precedent for the transfer of carbon from the Earth's crust to atmospheric carbon dioxide in quantities comparable to the burning of fossil fuels, without simultaneous changes in other parts of the carbon cycle and climate system".
Despite evidence from the geologic past, however, uncertainties about the current response of climate to human-induced changes remain, largely because of the inherent complexity of the climate system.
In light of the scientific uncertainty, the AGU have adopted the precautionary principle, and consider that whilst uncertainty about how mankind is influencing the present and future climate still remains, such "scientific uncertainty does not justify political inaction to mitigate human-induced climate change".
According to Cambridge Econometrics, the economic and industrial forecaster, the growth in the number of homes in the UK projected to occur over the next 15 years will prevent the UK from achieving its carbon dioxide emission reduction targets early in the next century.
Currently, the UK is committed to a 12.5% cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2008-2012 (as part of a Europe-wide cut of 8%), and the Government's own objective of a 20% cut in carbon dioxide emissions by 2010.
Cambridge Econometrics have forecast that with the projected growth in homes, UK carbon dioxide emissions will only fall by 7.5% by 2010, with emissions from the domestic sector rising 13%, the fastest projected rate of any emission sector.
Although emissions from other sectors, including electricity generation and manufacturing are projected to fall (21% and 25% respectively), increased emissions from more homes using more energy-consuming appliances may put pay to achieving the carbon dioxide reduction targets.
According to scientists at the Danish Meteorological Institute in Copenhagen, Denmark, springtime ozone levels over Greenland have declined substantially over the last 10 years.
The researchers found that monthly average spring ozone concentrations were lower in all years compared to the previous decade, and that ozone depletion was most pronounced when the polar vortex was most developed.
The polar vortex is a naturally occurring atmospheric circulation which partially isolates air in the polar regions during the winter and spring months, enhancing ozone losses due to chlorine loading from CFC emissions.
Whilst HCFCs have been used in place of their more damaging predecessors the CFCs, the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer had included a phase-out time table for these substances as well.
The Copenhagen Amendment to the Montreal Protocol agreed in 1992 aimed to phase out HCFCs completely by 2029, and to reduce levels by 35% and 90% by 2004 and 2019 respectively.
Under the new EU deal, HCFCs in the EU are to be phased out completely by 2026, with a reduction of 65% by 2008.
According to recent data issued by NASA and the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the size of this year's ozone hole over the Antarctic has yet again beaten all previous records.
Readers of Atmospheric Issues will be familiar with the annual reoccurrence of the Antarctic ozone hole every September to October (during the Southern Hemisphere springtime).
Ozone depletion accelerates during these months due to a combination of low upper atmospheric temperatures, isolated atmospheric airflow, and the return of sunlight after the winter.
This year's hole measured 27.3 million km2 on 19 September, beating the previous record by 5%, set two years ago.
The most widely accepted explanation for this year's record depletion is colder than average upper atmospheric temperatures, which allow the formation of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs), conducive to ozone destruction.
The cooler upper atmospheric temperatures may be a consequence of lower atmosphere and surface warming, as a result of heat trapping by greenhouse gases.
Although the largest ozone hole ever recorded, it is not quite the "deepest", with minimum ozone concentrations slightly above the record lows set in 1994.
Reporting in the journal Science (9 October, vol.
282), researchers at the University of Michigan (USA) collected data from over 350 boreholes from around the world, including eastern North America, central Europe, southern Africa and Australia.
Finding the warming trend, the scientists noted that such observations are largely consistent with other reconstructions of historic temperatures, such as tree ring and ice core analyses (see next story), providing independent confirmation of the unusual warming of the 20th century.
Further confirmation of climatic warming has been demonstrated by an analysis of tree rings, ice cores and corals by climate scientists at the University of East Anglia, Norwich.
Amerada Hess, the leading gas and oil producer in the UK, has launched the UK's first environmental tariff for domestic gas supply.
Under the scheme household customers pay a small surcharge to the Carbon Storage Trust, a non-profit-making organisation engaged in activities that offset man-made emissions of carbon dioxide.
Amerada Hess also makes a contributory payment for each customer who signs up for the new tariff.
River water quality in England and Wales may be declining as a result of climate change, according to the Environment Agency.
Although water quality improved between 1990 and 1996 as a result of environmental improvements being made by the water industry, water quality has deteriorated since then.
The largest decline has been witnessed in southeast England, which has experienced particularly low rainfall during much of the 1990s.
According to the Environment Agency, this suggests that longer-term climatic changes, through shifts in the weather, are having an effect on river water quality.
Data from the US Environmental Protection Agency indicate that the growing use of catalytic converters in cars to reduce local air pollution from road transport may be enhancing the prospects for global warming.
Catalytic converters remove the exhaust pollutants nitrogen dioxide (NO
In addition to PM10 pollution, the Underground also experiences higher than normal concentrations of radon, and ozone, produced by the trains' electric motors.
Although monitoring conducted independently by London Transport has to date failed to find any link between Underground pollution and health, they accept that it is not entirely possible to rule out that such a link may exist.
Results of a cross-European study of the short-term effects of air pollution on hospital admissions of respiratory diseases, published in the Archives of Environmental Health (vol.
53, no.
1), reveal that ozone is the chief air pollutant responsible for emergency hospital admissions.
The research was conducted in London, Paris, Milan, Amsterdam and Rotterdam.
Given the difference in climatic conditions experienced by each city, the researchers suggest that the link between ozone pollution and respiratory disease is unlikely to be a reflection of weather conditions.
It seems that weekends really are wetter - at least in the United States.
According to climate scientists at Arizona State University reporting in the journal Nature (vol.
394), Saturdays between 1979 and 1995 on the east coast of the USA were 22% wetter than Mondays.
According to the authors, nothing in nature operates on a weekly timescale.
Consequently, the 7-day rainfall cycle must be the result of some man-made factor, believed to be air pollution.
Indeed, atmospheric concentrations of air pollutants are known to increase towards the end of the working week, largely as a consequence of traffic exhaust emissions, reaching a maximum on Fridays and Saturdays before subsiding over the weekend.
It is possible that particulate pollution may be inducing raincloud formation by an enhanced "seeding" mechanism.
Clouds form by water vapour condensing around microscopic particulates in the atmosphere, a process known as seeding.
Theoretically, if additional man-made particulates are added to the atmosphere, the rate of cloud seeding should increase.
The weekly cycle of air pollution apparently also affects the strength of storms.
Weaker storms generally occur at weekends, supposedly because the enhanced cloud formation dissipates some of the storm's energy.
Although a link between air pollution and rainfall has not been demonstrated in the UK, the researchers believe that a general increase of rainfall on this side of the Atlantic may be the result of air pollution in the eastern USA.
The UK Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution (RCEP) is assessing the implications of reducing or phasing out the use of fossil fuels in a new study.
Whilst the emphasis will be on identifying the role of renewable energy, the Commission will also be considering the potential for nuclear power.
Currently, the UK Government is committed to a renewables energy supply of 10% of the total UK supply by 2010.
Given the legislative, economic, and social difficulties associated with the replacement of conventional fossil-fuel power generation, a substantial reduction in carbon dioxide emissions should not be expected until the middle of the next century at the earliest.
), a chief greenhouse gas, are to be reduced by 25% by 2008 to 2012, from the exhaust emissions of new cars, under a new ruling by the Council of European environment ministers.
This follows the voluntary agreement between the Association of European Car Manufactures and the European Commission to reduce average new car emissions of carbon dioxide to 120g/km by 2010.
The City of Westminster in London is to become a local air quality management area, following the 1995 Environment Act and research to be reported assessing the effects of restricting access to zero and low emission vehicles.
In Februray 1998, ARIC was awarded a further Environmental Action Fund award from the UK Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, for the 1998/99 financial year.
The new Atmosphere, Climate and Environment Information Programme will continue the work of ARIC’s air quality and climate change information programmes.
Consequently, the new title of this newsletter reflects a change in the emphasis of articles to be included in the newsletter.
A broader spectrum of issues relating to atmospheric pollution will be included from this edition onwards, to include for example, articles on global warming, air quality, acidification and energy efficiency / controlling emissions.
We hope that you will continue to find the newsletter of interest.
AIR POLLUTION DEATHS ESTIMATED AT 12,000 - 24,000 IN UK EACH YEAR
A new report by the Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants (COMEAP), an independent expert panel commissioned by the Department of Health, has been published entitled Quantification of the effects of air pollution on health in the United Kingdom.
The report has for the first time attempted to estimate the number of premature deaths brought on by air pollution.
Between 12 000 and 24 000 deaths per year have been estimated although the report identifies the difficulty in obtaining such figures as it is unknown how long victims would have lived had they not been exposed to the air pollution.
Most deaths are among elderly people already experiencing respiratory illnesses, who may have had very short life expectancies due to their conditions.
COMEAP concentrated their report on three pollutants; particles, sulphur dioxide and ozone.
High levels of particulates in urban areas were identified as being responsible for around 8,100 deaths and 10,500 hospital admissions each year.
The Catalytic Systems Division of Johnson Matthey have responded to the report by offering a solution to reduce particulate levels from diesel vehicles.
They claim that British technology such as their CRT diesel particulate filter trap can dramatically reduce particulate emissions and thus contribute to cleaner air in the UK.
Analyses of global surface temperature from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), NASA, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) and the UK-based Climate Research Unit have all confirmed that 1997 was the warmest year on record.
According to the available temperature data sets, average global surface temperature was approximately 0.4oC above the 1961-1990 average.
1997 ranked slightly higher than the last warmest year in 1995.
According to Phil Jones of the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia, the 5 warmest years on record have occurred during the 1990s, whilst 9 of the 10 warmest years have occurred since the beginning of the 1980s.
It is widely believed that the current El Niño episode in the tropical Pacific Ocean is responsible for the record warmth.
During the last 6 months, sea surface temperatures off the South American continent have been several degrees above normal, due to a reversal of winds which normally blow warm water west across the Pacific to Australasia.
The El Niño ocean current can influence global patterns of weather considerably.
Last year’s droughts and forest fires in Indonesia and Australia, and the mild weather experienced by the UK and Europe during January and February are believed to be phenomena of the warming in the Pacific.
According to James Hansen of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, El Niño may have contributed as much as a 0.1oC increase to the global annual mean temperature during 1997.
In contrast, satellites which measure temperature in the lowest 8 kilometers of the Earth’s atmosphere continue to contradict the surface-based temperature data.
Satellite data collected by the University of Alabama and NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center suggest that 1997 was only the 12th warmest year in an 18 year record.
In addition, temperatures over the full 18 years reveal a slight cooling trend of 0.06oC per decade.
Supporters of satellite temperature records point to the warming effects of urban “heat islands” which may over-emphasise the warming trend.
However, in a recent analysis in the journal Climate Change (vol.
37), scientists from the University of Buenos Aires in Argentina have suggested that there may be a separate bias in urban surface data which could have the opposite effect to “urban heating” on the long term trends.
emissions from coal and oil fired power stations relative to 1991, is to be met by 2005.
However, the Environment Agency plan to bring this target forward by four years to 2001 in order to improve air quality in the UK.
During the summer and autumn months, sea surface temperatures in the tropical Atlantic rise to the required 27oC Celsius to precipitate the birth of tropical storms and hurricanes.
After active 1995 and 1996 Atlantic hurricane seasons, 1997 needed only to record a modest amount of storm activity to witness a three year record.
Instead, 1997 turned out to be one of the weakest seasons for many decades, with only one tropical cyclone occurring during August and September, usually the most active period of the hurricane season.
The reduced storm activity in the Atlantic during 1997 was most likely the result of the El Niño episode in the tropical Pacific.
In contrast, hurricane activity in the North East Pacific increased markedly in response to El Niño.
A report commissioned by the National Society for Clean Air’s (NSCA) Cleaner Fuels Forum outlines that cleaner vehicle fuels such as low benzene petrol and ultra-low sulphur ‘city diesel’ can make a small but significant contribution to improving air quality in the UK.
Clare Holman, author of the report suggests that cleaner fuels are likely to have greatest impact in pollution hotspots such as large city centres.
According to a report published in the Journal of Climate (vol.
10), rainfall over land areas has increased globally during the 20th century, particularly in the mid to high latitudes.
Analysing data from over 5,000 stations worldwide, researchers at Columbia University in New York discovered a 22 mm increase in global annual rainfall since the turn of the century.
An increase in rainfall would be an expected consequence of warmer temperatures as rates of evaporation from surface ocean water would be enhanced.
Nevertheless, the large annual variability of rainfall, and the omission of data from large regions of the Earth (principally the oceans) makes it difficult to place a high degree of confidence in the reality of a truly global rise in rainfall.
The incidences of peak levels of low-level ozone are decreasing, but average levels of ozone are increasing.
A new report by the Photochemical Oxidants Review Group (PORG) published in January 1998, reveals that whilst peak levels of low-level ozone have decreased by 20% in the last 10 years, average levels are still increasing.
The report describes the National Air Quality Strategy standard of 50ppb for ozone as "challenging", suggesting that VOC and NOx emission reductions of a substantial nature will be required for these standards to be met.
The report Ozone in the UK : Fourth Report of the Photochemical Oxidants Review Group is available from Lucy Moore, DETR (Tel: +44 (0)171 890 3000) aric .
The Government have announced that &pound4.2m will be provided to 97 local authorities for the purchase of air pollution monitoring equipment.
The money will be used to purchase the following quantities of monitoring kits; 100 PM10, 70 nitric oxide, 50 sulphur dioxide, 4 lead and 1 VOC.
Last month, the British Government Panal on Sustainable Development launched its 4th report.
The Panel met four times during 1997, and selected four major diverse topics for study: the impact of human activities on marine biodiversity; endocrine disrupting chemicals; the contribution of good architectural design and use of materials to sustainable living and working; and foresight and sustainable development.
Furthermore, this latest report reviews recommendations put forward by the Panel in earlier reports, including items on environmental economics, environmental education, ozone depletion, biotechnology, forestry, climate change and air quality.
The U.S. government releases scientific reports on global warming through the U.S. Global Change Research Program (formerly called the Climate Change Science Program).
The consensus reports featured here, which represent a broad survey and assessment of the current state of the science, address the impacts of climate change on extreme weather and in turn the effects on human health and the economy.
The fact sheets highlight the most significant impacts across the United States from the featured reports.
June 2009 | Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States
This report, which confirms previous evidence that global temperature increases in recent decades have been primarily human-induced, incorporates the latest information on rising temperatures and sea levels; increases in extreme weather events; and other climate-related phenomena.
It is the first such report in almost a decade to break out those impacts by U.S. region and economic sector, and the first to do so in such great detail.
June 2008 | Weather and Climate Extremes in a Changing Climate
This study, led by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and issued in June by the U.S. Climate Change Science Program, finds human-induced warming has resulted in warmer average temperatures,increased precipitation and more frequent heat waves.
This report from the Environmental Protection Agency, released in July, focuses on impacts of global climate change on the human health and welfare.
Among other topics, it addresses food and water supplies, natural disasters, health issues and recreation.
This National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) report, announced in May by the White House, looks at current trends in global change and projects major trends for the future.
It analyzes the effects of these changes on the natural environment, agriculture, water resources, transportation and human health.
Gaia – the Earth System [ search ] – is alive and like any living entity has rights.
Earth has a right to not be stripped of its vegetative skin, its flesh mined, body punctured by wells, ecosystems liquidated; and precious water, air and oceans tainted.
Gaia has the right to peacefully exist and to be free of harm, violence or ecocide (to be murdered).
Air, water, land and ocean ecosystems are Gaia’s self-regulating internal ecosystem organs.
All Gaia’s creatures possess an equal claim upon a fair share of her bounty for continued existence.
Yet Gaia has a right to prohibit at any time, using any means, any one species from over-running the biosphere and habitats shared by all.
Sadly the industrial, speculative and unsustainable capitalistic economy benefiting some humans is killing Earth.
This growth machine in population, economy and inequitable consumption has established as the norm an immoral, short-sighted way of life based upon eating ecosystems and children (or at least their future) to wantonly consume and grow a bit more.
If cumulative impacts of human ecosystem destruction upon Gaia continue; the Earth System dies, taking humanity, all life and creation with her.
The current paradigm’s emphasis upon growth at all costs is so pernicious that almost certainly only revolution, fundamental social change and personal transformation can eradicate it.
Earth’s life – from seeds to plants, bees to trees, plant communities to ecosystems, and all life in between – is remarkable.
We are witnessing the end product of 3.5 billion years of glorious evolution, now being cleared for toilet paper and fish sticks.
Three hundred years ago humans began dismantling these priceless biological and ecological systems that provide their habitat for growth in population, economies and consumption.
Somewhere around the time Europeans spilled forth to enslave and conquer the world, this idea was lost.
These ideals of ecological colonialism – equating ecosystem destruction, biological diminishment, hierarchical subjugation and growth in virtually everything; with progress – have spread globally, creating a world of over six billion human super-predators.
These beasts exist upon the flesh of Earth, and are raping her supine bounty for selfish self-aggrandizement.
Ecological Internet is not the first or only one to note limits to growth and collapsing ecosystems, however we are amongst the first to diagnose people's power Earth Revolution on Gaia’s behalf as the only workable means to achieve ecologically sufficient solutions for global sustainability.
Humanity has a long history of expanding rights necessary for a broader sense of well-being to humans, and has fought just revolutions and wars to broaden this sphere of rights.
The very same Europeans whose worldview led them to slaughter natives and natural ecosystems developed the Rights of Man, later amended to include most women and races.
In just the past few hundred years humans have made great strides in personal liberty, freedom and equality that rank amongst the greatest human achievements ever.
Monarchy and systematic slavery have largely been banished from Earth, and this is true human progress in understanding the nature and rights of being.
Sadly human liberties remain incomplete, fragile and are not universalized.
Billions continue to live under authoritarian regimes, women are not given equal rights in most places, billions more are unable to exercise personal liberties as gross economic depredation leads to a scramble to survive, and the dominant economic system of hierarchical capitalism continues to bind most to a life of slave wages.
Shockingly, two billion live on under $2/day, just under a billion each lack fresh water and food.
And a system of elite rule remains firmly entrenched.
Yet the idea that all humans are created equal and enjoy liberties and freedom has become established and continues to be perfected.
Now what of the rights of Earth that makes human rights possible?
The Rights of Earth and all creatures will surely be the next great expansion of revealed truth and natural law.
The non-human world – the air, water, land, oceans and their plants and wildlife – provide the living context for all biological existence including, for now, humans.
Together these ecosystems, organisms and their ecological processes and patterns combine to create Gaia – a living, self-regulating organism – who’s right to exist is independent of human notions of value.
That is birds, plants, trees, wildlife, wetlands and other ecosystems have intrinsic value; and a right to exist independent of human needs and wants.
The disease that permeates the human condition is to continue viewing Gaia as mere resources for consumption, rather than being acknowledged as the ecosystems that make all life and the Rights of Man possible.
This state of enraged human ecocide must end immediately at all costs.
Humans are entirely dependent upon Earth for every aspect of our existence.
Continued ignorance, greed, fear, or just giving up because we are overwhelmed are not options.
Each of us is now called to be the greatest of the great generations and save Earth from ourselves, by granting and enforcing her rights.
Earth has the right to continue evolving.
It has the right to be free from human geoengineering technology that further destroys creation.
Earth has the right to not have its skin – natural terrestrial ecosystems – peeled from its body.
Water – the Earth’s blood – has the right to flow freely creating the conditions for life.
Earth has a right to bounteous oceans, to be toxic free, to not drown in carbon and nitrogen.
Earth has the right to have it's human load lightened, so that it may heal, and to be ecologically restored to its original condition.
Earth has a right to exist independent of any other human concern – including growing the economy and population, providing outrageous consumption for some and little for others, or any obligation to lift the over-populated poor from material poverty by destroying the future.
The biosphere has a right, indeed an obligation, to continue functioning regardless of whether this inconveniences the wants of any one species or some of its members.
Without Gaia there is no being; no singing, politics, love or making love, dance, sport, economics, living, or anything.
Earth’s rights are paramount over every other consideration.
As the foundation of known being, Earth is the ultimate truth.
Gaia is God.
Earth and her humanity and all creatures are poised upon a precipice of total and complete ecological and social collapse.
Earth has the right to mercilessly slaughter any creatures that threaten the integrity of the whole and other parts.
Insofar as knowledgeable humans can positively help, Earth’s ecocide must be resisted at all costs using all means, or being ends and there is nothing.
Should the human animal – the current rulers of Earth (for now anyway) fail to expand the notion of the Rights of Earth, and stop its pervasive dismembering of Gaia, it will be to their own detriment and eventual demise.
As one species amongst many, continued human being and shared survival depends upon taking a hard turn back to Earth, natural ecosystems and Gaia’s defense.
The meaning of the rest of enlightened human being is protecting and restoring ecosystems making up our habitat – air, water, land, soils, fish, oceans, toxics - and to make a just, equitable and sustainable world for all Gaia’s creatures.
You are encouraged to hurry back to land and dedicate your being, your very life, to Gaia.
Provision of Earth’s right to exist means getting back to the land to protect terrestrial, water, ocean and atmospheric ecosystems.
Organic gardening, permaculture, population limits, ending coal and old forest logging and much more are keys to Earth and humanity’s survival.
All our shared futures, all life's survival, are being determined now.
If Gaia undergoes much more ecosystem loss and diminishment, and her human inhabitants fail to turn the corner to embrace ecological protection and restoration, it almost certainly will be too late.
Earth and her defenders have all rights to use escalating revolutionary tactics, to do whatever is necessary to avert an end to being.
Indeed all global citizens that understand what is at stake for the planet and all of Gaia’s shared survival have a sacred obligation to slay the growth machine, banish speculative and industrial capitalism, and return to a rewilded, relocalized and a just, free, equitable and ecologically sustainable Earth.
We are at a point in history where any future revolutions would rightly find indiscriminate killing intolerable.
There is no need for terrorism, and this is not what is being discussed.
Yet there are so very many soft property targets for sabotage within the growth machine.
To say "violence is never the answer" as Earth is dying by known perpetrators relegates the biosphere and society to apocalyptic ecological collapse which will assuredly not be non-violent.
It is well past time for the global ecological sustainability movement to carefully consider all options and begin escalating its tactics.
Or we can just roll over with Gaia and die.
did You know that when her Ocean creates soil.etc.
erosion she does this specifically to obtain minerals from.
The line of thinking that I am pursuing in my current work is three-fold.
It is: (1) That we have an absolute responsibility to other beings (I mean sentient beings), PRESENT AND FUTURE, that we owe them our all; (2) That our relation to these beings needs to be primarily one of love and care, not of 'rights' or 'justice', which are concepts that only really fully apply among potential equals who can make claims against each other; and (3) That just genuinely loving future people (and future animals) would be enough to save the whole ecosystem - because we creatures are utterly dependent on that ecosystem being functional and relatively intact.
Why would it be "silly", Peter, to give the Earth/Nature rights?
All living things depend upon a healthy thriving natural environment, and this depends upon natural cycles and processes such as water and air purification, oxygen production and soil formation.
If we do not give nature rights, neither humans nor other life forms have any rights because we utterly depend upon nature for our survival.
We are one and the same as nature.
Nature can exist without us: we cannot exist without nature.
In the developed world, we have our idols.
They are fast/cheap travel, cheap unsustainable buying habits, among others.
Despite the rather new age tone of the article, I agree with it's premise; that we must be good stewards of what we have been given.
Just because we life thousands of miles away from the rainforests, doesn't mean we're not affected by the deforestation occurring there.
Just because we live in a large city, doesn't mean the oil spills in China and the Gulf don't affect us.
This article shows that people was created to encourage industrial development, with the lead killing the surrounding ecosystem.
In fact many are dying ecosystem caused by man himself.
The Earth's climate is now clearly out of balance and is warming.
Many components of the climate system—including the temperatures of the atmosphere, land and ocean, the extent of sea ice and mountain glaciers, the sea level, the distribution of precipitation, and the length of seasons—are now changing at rates and in patterns that are not natural and are best explained by the increased atmospheric abundances of greenhouse gases and aerosols generated by human activity during the 20th century.
Global average surface temperatures increased on average by about 0.6°C over the period 1956–2006.
As of 2006, eleven of the previous twelve years were warmer than any others since 1850.
The observed rapid retreat of Arctic sea ice is expected to continue and lead to the disappearance of summertime ice within this century.
Evidence from most oceans and all continents except Antarctica shows warming attributable to human activities.
Recent changes in many physical and biological systems are linked with this regional climate change.
A sustained research effort, involving many AGU members and summarized in the 2007 assessments of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, continues to improve our scientific understanding of the climate.
During recent millennia of relatively stable climate, civilization became established and populations have grown rapidly.
In the next 50 years, even the lower limit of impending climate change—an additional global mean warming of 1°C above the last decade—is far beyond the range of climate variability experienced during the past thousand years and poses global problems in planning for and adapting to it.
Warming greater than 2°C above 19th century levels is projected to be disruptive, reducing global agricultural productivity, causing widespread loss of biodiversity, and—if sustained over centuries—melting much of the Greenland ice sheet with ensuing rise in sea level of several meters.
If this 2°C warming is to be avoided, then our net annual emissions of CO
must be reduced by more than 50 percent within this century.
With such projections, there are many sources of scientific uncertainty, but none are known that could make the impact of climate change inconsequential.
Given the uncertainty in climate projections, there can be surprises that may cause more dramatic disruptions than anticipated from the most probable model projections.
With climate change, as with ozone depletion, the human footprint on Earth is apparent.
The cause of disruptive climate change, unlike ozone depletion, is tied to energy use and runs through modern society.
Solutions will necessarily involve all aspects of society.
Mitigation strategies and adaptation responses will call for collaborations across science, technology, industry, and government.
Members of the AGU, as part of the scientific community, collectively have special responsibilities: to pursue research needed to understand it; to educate the public on the causes, risks, and hazards; and to communicate clearly and objectively with those who can implement policies to shape future climate.
The United States of America is an epic experiment, as despite great accomplishments and numerous imperfections, we share a long history of constantly striving to improve our union.
As Americans settle in for Memorial Day to remember veterans of all stripes – from great wars of world defense to more recent military adventurism – it is appropriate to consider what the current Gulf Oil Spill says about the American way of life.
Plainly, our addiction to oil and consumption in general threatens to destroy regional and global ecosystems – the water, air, land and oceans –upon which Americans, humanity and all species depend upon for habitat and life.
America has and continues to face many challenges – repudiating slavery, enfranchising most, world wars – and most recently the inevitable slowdown of economic growth as speculative, industrial capitalism runs its course.
America has enjoyed for awhile super-sized living and grown to be what it is based upon liquidating ecosystems.
We have progressed to the point where regional ecosystems are collapsing – most obviously in the Gulf Coast, but throughout the vast country as ecosystems are dying.
America now faces our most difficult and profound test ever, coming to terms with our deeply ecologically unsustainable lifestyles, and committing to national and global ecological sustainability.
Clearly the American way of life has been built upon liquidating our own and foreign natural life-giving ecosystems to access resources for consumption.
To equate mowing ancient forests, dumping waste into water, over-fishing oceans, polluting the atmosphere, and the pervasive toxic chemical cocktail with progress and development is absurd.
It is entirely possible that oil deep undersea and within our shared Earth was not meant to be drilled, much less burnt.
America must directly face our profound dependence upon oil and destruction of natural ecosystems as the basis of our economy; or our country will collapse, many if not all will needlessly suffer and prematurely die, and a livable Earth may cease to exist.
The oil spilling endlessly into the Gulf of Mexico – one of America’s most rich ecosystems –shows clearly Americans of all types will commit to ecological sustainability or our free country will cease to exist.
Marshes and rivers and forests and fish are far more than resources – they and all natural ecosystems provide for humanity’s habitat and existence upon Earth.
The American way of life must be updated by what Ecology – the radical science – teaches us about limits to growth and requirements to sustain the biosphere.
And to reflect moral outrage that as we continue to literally stuff ourselves and over-develop to death, two billion people live worldwide on under $2/day, 800 million without access to clean water.
Collapsing ecosystems will almost certainly be used as the pretext for some sort of more authoritarian political system.
The resources necessary for all the gadgets, cars, energy and consumption found in the American dream are largely being taken at the point of gun by the U.S. military, and through neo-colonial dependency arrangements between U.S. business and resource owners.
911 was direct blowback from several decades of such behavior.
It is time to stop thinking in terms of tribal nationalism and embrace the human family; as ecological challenges including forest loss, water scarcity, ocean decline, air pollution, soil depletion, nitrogen saturation and biodiversity loss threaten to destroy all nations’ peoples.
How many more U.S. soldiers must kill and die needlessly in foreign lands to support these inequities and unsustainability?
Let us buttress America’s commitment to true freedom and liberty with equal devotion to equity, justice and global ecological sustainability.
Future American and global ecological sustainability looks less urban, more organic; simple but quality lives; less government, more community, and dedication to protecting and restoring ecosystems.
It is possible and crucial for all our shared survival to live simply, laugh often, and love deeply as we lead deeply fulfilling lives within the context of a healthy and vibrant environment, and a steady state economy which can last forever.
Ecological Internet recently declared a planetary ecological emergency[1] based upon overwhelming new ecological science indicating Earth is at or near the tipping point, and key global ecosystems and life-support systems are failing.
All true Americans and global citizens are urged to dramatically reduce their personal consumption and to commit to massively reducing their personal use of oil.
And the U.S. government must cease to be an oil oligarchy, divorce itself from this Earth destroying industry, and stop waging war to feed its oil addiction.
Failure on either account may justly lead to the next great American Revolution: a people’s power Earth Revolution on behalf of Earth, all her life, and the human family.

It was dusted off and revised when a recent administration was looking for an excuse to invade Iraq.
There has certainly been enough cause for it to have been blowback, but it wasn't.
It doesn’t all collapse at once, but takes a few years and decades –very few — following the tipping point.
Unfortunately, the real collapse — global warming being a large part of it — caused by centuries of environmental degradation that is now peaking, began in earnest in the late 1980s.
Don't depend on your votes or your contributions to solve this.
We must each act individually and collectively to solve this problem by dedicating our time and our treasure.
Let me ask, have you caulked and sealed every spot in your home?
Have you helped your neighbor to conserve energy?
We've all got to work at this.
Think of this as war.
For every effort made by General Washington, there were many more efforts made by average citizens and partisans.
It is up to all of us!
Regulators at the California Air Resources Board (CARB) are poised later this week to declare that biofuel from corn ethanol [search] cannot help the state address climate change.
In assessing the true environmental cost of corn ethanol, it was found this biofuel is worse than petroleum when total greenhouse gas emissions are considered.
This is because as with all monocultures, corn ethanol for biofuels lead to numerous other indirect land use changes.
Increased industrial agriculture results in rising land pressures and the loss of soil and forest carbon sinks elsewhere.
Such a declaration disallowing corn ethanol biofuel from counting as emissions reductions would be a considerable blow to the corn-ethanol industry in the United States and would likely set a national precedent.
Ecological Internet and Rainforest Rescue are concerned with America's growing ethanol industry, and the precedent it sets for massive agricultural industrialization of the world's remaining rainforests and other natural wildlands.
Please call upon the CARB to heed the overwhelming evidence that agrofuels worsen climate change through further deforestation and the destruction of other soils and ecosystems, drive food prices up, force more people worldwide into hunger, malnutrition and landlessness; and decimate biodiversity and ecosystems.
TAKE ACTION!
If we choose to keep doing the very things we are doing now by maximally growing the global economy in the noticeably finite world we inhabit, something horrendous will occur eventually.
What concerns me most is that current gigantic scale and anticipated growth rate of the global economy will precipitate, sooner rather than later, an unimaginable wreckage of human civilization and/or the catastrophic collapse of the ecology of the planetary home we are blessed to inhabit.
Ten years ago, I worried about my grandchildren facing such an awful set of circumstances.
Then a few years ago, it appeared children would be put at risk after my generation had completed a fool's errand in which a few million fortunate individuals took so many resources for themselves and left billions of unfortunate children with a ravaged Earth.
Such a possibility troubled me because self-proclaimed Masters of the Universe leading my not-so-great, avaricious and arrogant generation -- a single generation on a mission -- have adamantly advocated that we commandeer, consume and hoard a "lion's share" of Earth limited resources and, in that process, have perversely condoned the relentless degradation of Earth's environs and the reckless dissipation of the planet's scarce resources....come what may for the children, coming generations, biodiversity, Earth's body and its environs.
My name is Daniel Knickelbein and I am 17 year-old high school student from Oak Park, Illinois.
I guess you could call me an “environmentalist,” based on the fact that I believe that global warming is a serious threat to mankind and I believe in the conservation of natural lands and resources in their purest form.
But I don’t think I can be labeled as a crazy left-winger because, well, who doesn’t like clean water, or land available for fishing or hiking, or restoring natural forests to their original beauty.
The reason I am writing this letter is because I believe that starting TODAY, the United States Congress must act to pass serious climate change legislation, and must also recognize that we must conserve the few natural lands we still have left in this country.
The science on global warming is unmistakable.
When 97 percent of climatologists in this country believe that global warming is man-made and will have serious effects on our world, we must act to do something about that.
It is unfathomable to me how some of you in Congress can not address this issue, while you sit and bicker about party ideals.
For those who say that addressing climate change and global warming will hurt the economy, you must think again.
As many economists and scientists point out, a “green” economy is an investment in the future, sort of like beginning to tackle the large deficit that has been passed down by many presidents.
Now some of you skeptics will say that I am an affluent suburban teenager who has no idea what it is like to experience financial hardship that you say will be cause by tackling global warming.
Please think again.
My father was a chemist employed at his dream job for 20 years, but when the recession hit, his lab was forced to fire him because of lack of funding.
While I am currently by no means poor, my father’s misfortune has left our family in a somewhat difficult situation.
Now, we have any opportunity to help millions of other Americans like my father.
If our country (you guys and girls in Congress) decide to invest in my future with green technologies, my father might be able to work again.
And yes investing in renewable energy and green technology is MY future.
Long after all 535 of you are gone, I would like to live in a safe and prosperous planet, not a planet where I have to worry about where I find my next meal, or my next glass of water.
If we continue to allow global warming to go unchecked, that scenario is not exactly science fiction, it could and very well may become reality.
So today, on the 39th Earth Day, I ask every single member of Congress to consider their priorities as some of the most powerful people in the United States.
Do you wish to leave your children and grandchildren in a safe and prosperous world?
Should we leave them in a place that is dangerous and unhealthy?
Should we allow the few remaining natural lands to be destroyed for a profit?
These are questions that I hope you will consider when voting on a climate change bill.
The only thing I ask of all of you is to please read my letter, and to consider what I have said.
Whether industrial corn is used for biofuel or to feed hogs and cows its still a waste of land.
To decrease erosion and save topsoil with its carbon and nitrogen resource, much of this corn farmland in the USA should be returned to grass and trees.
Cattle could be grazed on their natural food which is grass and allowed to roam and have quality existence.
Tree using wildlife such as deer, squirrels and birds would also benefit.
And carbon would be absorbed.
This could be done with a huge expansion of the Conservation Reserve Program under the Farm Bill and the US dept of Agriculture.
When we look at sustainable issues and deciding what those are going to be.
We have to be smarter about how we use our land for this purpose.
As the article states is this really going to be a long term answer to the problem?
No it is not.
The land that will be used to plant these additional crops to meet the demand of the US will end up destroying natural habitats and prairies.
Due to urban sprawl, we have already devastated these natural habitats, which are vital to the ecological balance.
The other consideration when taking these lands, is what was already stated in an earlier comment, “soil erosion”.
Are we considering mitigation practices when we decide to change natural habitats to more corn fields or roadways, etc.
Stopping the erosion of soils is a crucial step when you are talking about flooding and other hazards that can occur.
This is more than planting corn as a possible sustainable solution, we have to consider the long term affects of these decisions.
ALERT: Coal Kills -- Time for People Power to Protect the Climate
The use of coal must end if we are to maintain an operable atmosphere, human civilization and all the Earth's complex life
The growing and powerful climate movement [search] has, based upon climate science, already shown conclusively that climate change is real and deadly.
Now we must urge politicians, industry and individuals to immediately act and transform themselves if we are to survive.
Finally, a mass protest against coal -- whose plants are "factories of death" -- is to occur in America, reflecting the urgency and depth of the one most important, sufficient climate response through non-violent civil disobedience.
Coal generates the highest greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions [search] per unit of energy obtained, and large reserves remain that must not be burned if we are to survive.
Continued reliance upon coal, without immediate phasing-out of plants that emit into the atmosphere, is incompatible with any scenario to reduce atmospheric GHGs to a safe level in time to avert irreversible and catastrophic climate change.
Ecological Internet wholeheartedly endorses the Capitol Climate Action -- the largest mass civil disobedience for the climate in U.S. history. On March 2, you are urged to join thousands of people in protesting at the Capitol Power Plant in Washington DC, a plant that powers the U.S. Congress with dirty energy.
We encourage you to consider marching and getting arrested to make the point that the age of coal is over, and/or to show your support for the brave protestors and the end of coal by sending the message below.
If available technology was used to clean and scrub this smoke, coal could be used in the short term.
Technology costs money which ultimately means consumers pay - as always.
Governments are too frightened of alienating voters to risk enforcing existing pollution control legislation.
In the UK we have a lobby against wind turbines - unbelievable.
I wonder how many generations it will take to change all attitudes.
Coal is a chemically complex fuel.
Whenever it is burned, gases are given off and particles of ash, called "fly ash," are released.
The sulfur in coal combines with oxygen to form sulfur dioxide, which can be a major source of air pollution if emitted in large enough quantities.
the burning of coal can affect our ecosystem and increase the global warming.If we to live in a clean and healthy climate we have invent new source of energy like biofuels, low carbon fuel and solar energy which will replace the coal use.
My thinking is that it is unlikely that we are going to truly do everything that we can to get off of fossil fuels until it is made clear to everyone just how essential it is to our economic well being that we do so.
Fortunately, from a climate change and environmental perspective, mother nature has seen fit to severly limit just how much of this stuff we will be able to access.
The next century will see the end of N.A.
's massive consumption of oil, gas, and coal even if we pump it out of the ground as fast as humanly possible.
It is therefore incumbent on us from an economic standpoint to make alternate arrangements as soon as we possibly can if we hope not to suffer an economic collapse that makes the current one look like the good old days.
For U.S. energy security this would appear to be a Santa clause.
Canadians on the other hand may not be feeling quite so cheery about this arrangement, perhaps most especially at Christmas time given our climate.
The U.S. today consumes close to 25% of the world's production of these finite, climate dangerous, energy dense molecules.
A disparity well worth considering.
I just got this letter below from Bill McKibben--and today he's helping to create the largest ever civil-disobedience on climate change in history.
He's in DC with thousands, protesting the coal-fired Capitol Power plant--a dirty symbol of our dirty energy history.
In a few hours, the first big protest of the Obama era -- and the largest-ever civil disobedience against global warming in this country -- will take place against the not-very-scenic backdrop of the coal-fired Capitol Hill Power Plant in Washington DC.
Please stand behind the thousands gathering today in DC, and show the world that people everywhere are uniting behind a future free of coal--a future safe from the ravages of climate change.
I share your vision of a coal-free future, and stand in solidarity with the coalition of citizens united not only to get DC off of coal, but for a clean energy future and a safe-climate for the entire planet.
With President Obama and a new US Congress, there is more possibility for climate action than ever before.
It really feels like the U.S. is close to a breakthrough--and this protest can help create the political space a breakthrough requires.
In that one plant -- owned and operated by our senators and representatives -- you can see all the filth that comes with coal.
There are the particulates it spews into the air and hence the lungs of those Washington residents who enjoy breathing.
There are the profits it hands to the coal industry, which is literally willing to level mountains across West Virginia and Kentucky to increase its fat margins.
And most of all there is the invisible carbon dioxide it spews each day into the atmosphere, drying our forests, melting our glaciers and acidifying our oceans.
This may seem like an odd time to take to the streets -- after all, the new administration has done more in a month to fight global warming than all the presidents of the past 20 years.
But in fact, it's the perfect moment.
For one thing, our leaders may actually listen -- in the anti-science years of the Bush administration, global warming activists concentrated their work on state capitols, knowing that the federal government would never budge.
Now, if we demonstrate that there's real public pressure, we may give the Democratic Congress and the White House some room to act.
More to the point, the time not to act is running out.
Climate science has grown steadily darker in the past 18 months, ever since the rapid melt of Arctic sea ice in the summer of 2007 showed scientists that change was coming faster than they'd reckoned.
That message was underlined recently at the Washington meetings of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, when Stanford researcher Christopher Field said: "We are basically looking now at a future climate that's beyond anything we've considered seriously in climate model simulations.
" Our foremost climatologist, NASA's James Hansen, has given that future a number -- any level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere beyond 350 parts per million, his team has demonstrated, is "incompatible with the planet on which civilization developed.
"
Since we're already past that number -- the carbon dioxide level is at 387 parts per million -- the fight is on.
Indeed, by Hansen's calculation, the world will need to be out of the coal-burning business by 2030, and the West much sooner than that, if we're ever going to get back to 350.
It's no accident that NASA's James Hansen announced he'll be on hand to get arrested.
So will Gus Speth, who ran the United Nations Development Programme, and the farmer and author Wendell Berry who has seen the devastation of his native Kentucky.
And maybe most heartening, I'll be joined by over a thousand college students who will have just come from lobbying in the halls of Congress for clean energy.
They'll have just wrapped up PowerShift '09--an climate convergence organized by a separate coaltion that promises to be a historic catalyst in this movement.
It's a perfect healthy movement is like a healthy ecosystem--marked by spectacular diversity.
There are many ways to be a climate activist--lobby, rally, or for me today, risking arrest with civil disobedience.
P.S.
Please forward this message far and wide.
If your friends and family share a vision for coal-free, clean energy future safe from climate change--and I'm quite sure at least some of them do--ask them to sign our solidarity statement by clicking here: http://www.350.org/coal-free/
Local environmentalists here in the Mojave Desert are suing to stop construction of solar thermal plants on relatively trivial grounds.
The first major plant location at Ivanpah is pretty barren, but they're claiming it's pristine and lush.
I suspect that they are being manipulated and probably paid by the coal industry.
It's getting pretty weird.
Much electricity is wasted on supercomputers for searches nad many other things., and reducing this would eliminate some need for more and more power plants, renewable or otherwise.
Let the price and people will waste less, like happened in the last gasoline price runup.
Prospects are now dwindling that a binding Climate Change treaty will be agreed in Mexico later this year.
But the science is no longer in any serious doubt.
Fossil fuels, used to generate power, are the major contributors to global greenhouse gas emissions - and coal is the largest single culprit.
Yet many states now plan to deepen their dependency on coal, while the social and environmental impacts of mining it receive much less attention – even from climate change activists - than the consequences of burning it.
In order to get on with major reductions in carbon dioxide emissions, within both a still functional biosphere and viable capitalistic system, the price of emitting carbon must be set -- and quickly and accurately.
There are two primary methods of doing so - the establishment of carbon markets [search] and the levying of carbon taxes [search] .
The conservative newspaper Financial Times favors carbon taxes, as does Ecological Internet within our Lincoln Plan carbon tax campaign , and today ran an interesting series of articles which essentially find a carbon tax to be easier and more effective in pricing carbon.
A recent report likens the individual market in carbon credits to " Offsetting Indulgences for your Climate Sins ".
The Financial Times was equally skeptical, as their investigation of carbon credit trading concludes : "Companies and individuals rushing to go green have been spending millions on 'carbon credit' projects that yield few if any environmental benefits.
" They found some carbon reductions paid for in carbon offset schemes are never carried out, and others would have been made anyway.
The European carbon market which has been in existence the longest and is most established has given out so many carbon credits that very little reductions in emissions were necessary by industry.
Ecological Internet supports a global carbon market that is well regulated, but not as a replacement for carbon taxes, which we are convinced will address the issue of pricing carbon more quickly, effectively and simply.
We concur that "while short-term politics favour markets, taxes would be better in the long term because industry needs certainty for investments... A government committing to painful taxes signals the seriousness of its intentions..."
"In order to get on with major reductions in carbon dioxide emissions, within both a still functional biosphere and viable capitalistic system, the price of emitting carbon must be set -- and quickly and accurately.

"
There it is, one of the biggest reasons behind the global warming alarmist position.
First they create companies that sell "carbon offsets" then they create a demand... brilliant capitalism except for the part where the government mandates YOUR participation.
Funny how it is the legislators mandating participation who are the major stockholders....
Setting carbon tax accurately: I am just wondering how this could be achieved especially with automobiles.
This obviously has to take into account the differences in fuel efficiencies of automobiles.
The best method should consider the carbon dioxide that is emitted by an automobile.
Basing carbon tax per gallon of gas consumed, as mentioned in one paper, sounds good but is there a mechanism in place to effect this on automobiles yet?
This would be helpful in some countries that use engine size as factor in charging carbon tax.
Globally, is there an effective body that monitors the implementation and continuity of the carbon taxing world wide?
If people pay to their governments, have we considered the situation in fast declining economies - obviously they will not revise the taxes frequent enough to keep up with the international value.
Should we all pay for the same ‘climate sin’ equally regardless of spatial location as carbon dioxide knows no boundaries?
Lol, you talk about this as if it's a good idea.
It's a terrible idea.
In fact, you talk as if global warming is a fact.
It's not, it's a THEORY.
Did you know that through the 60's there was a GLOBAL COOLING THEORY too?
As for carbon, keep pumping it into the air, plants need it, we're made out of it, and it is NOT the major greenhouse gas.
That would be water vapor, so if you really want to help 'save' the earth, stop breathing.
Anyone with a basic understanding of economics and rudimentary familiarity with public policy discussions over climate change knows that offsets and carbon taxes are two different animals.
The other (carbon tax) would tax activities that produce carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases.
These taxes would not be levied by companies; they could only be levied by governments.
And they would be completely political unpalatable unless they replaced, in whole or in part, other taxes (payroll taxes, for example).
Econ 101 tells us that people would respond by modifying their behavior, just as they do with a range of other behaviors that are taxed.
The allegation that carbon taxes have something to do with a specific individual making money from offest companies is a strawman argument.
No surprise there, Cranky!
But it was a nice try......if a bit polemical and simplistic.
Good points ewoc.
I just wanted to mention that when I speak of "carbon markets" I am speaking more broadly of the market for carbon credits which includes a wide range of buying and selling including buying by individuals as carbon offsets or may be purchased and sold by institutions such as utilities.
All of this carbon offsetting and capping and trading of emission permits is one market in carbon credits with various degrees of efficacy and actual carbon reductions behind the credit.
I would contend that smaller personal offsets have been less effective in actually finding activities to reduce carbon emissions that would not have happened in any regard or that work (lots of tree planting of marginal utility for carbon reductions), and that the larger institutional trading has been marred by an excess of carbon credits that were in the European case simply given away to utilities to start.
That is, there was an over supply of credits and as such the European carbon market crashed.
And then there is the outrage of CDM money - one source of carbon credits - being used to fund such activities as oil palm plantations for biofuels in Europe where rainforests once stood - clearly a carbon negative venture that the carbon market funds.
So there have been a whole range of issues on the carbon market that while problematic I do not believe means it should be abandoned, but it is not working as it should or could be or is presented as doing currently.
Hopefully the carbon market aspect of reducing emissions will learn from these mistakes as it expands, otherwise it will simply be another greenhwash to allow people to feel good and polluters to continue polluting for awhile more until real action is taken.
The point of the original blog posting is that carbon taxes show a resolve and will undoubtedly work in reducing emissions, and are much less complicated albeit politically unpalatable.
We need to present this carbon tax policy to the concerned public as a cure for global warming , while yes reduceingother taxes proportionately.
I really see no other way than taxing carbon that climate change can be abated in the manageable range while capitalism fo the sort that is desireable and works for the average person remains dominant.
I say the devil is in the details.
That assumes you agree that global warming is a serious problem worthy of well crafted public policy solutions.
If you don't, why are you wasting your time on this blog?
The lastest British Arctic Survey reported several weeks ago their estimates that the Arctic may be ice free in summer within 13 years.
I know, I know, they are all leftists in Al Gore's pockets; they are all on govt grants; why does it matter if the Arctic is ice free; climate changes anyway; everyone should just move to ?etc etc.
Don't worry - just read Ayn Rand and it will be allright!
Hey idiots...what uses Carbon Dioxide?
Plants! what do plants do with Carbon Dioxide?
create oxygen which last time I checked the rest of us need.
Global warming is a Global HOAX!
yes, the earth is going through a warming cycle just like it did when it went through a cooling cycle (remember, glaciers created the great lakes during this cooling period) the sun is responsible for 90% of this warming trend and no damn tax is going to stop the sun from over-heating the solar system.
You all are being bam-boozled AGAIN.
Use your head, what is a tax gonna do?
I'll tell you, it's gonna go in the corrupt corporations and Govt.
pockets that's where, hell, these idiots don't spend our current taxes correctly and you all trust these crooks with more of your money?
this world is gonna get exactly what ignorant folks deserve...RAILROADED straight to tyranny.
Dumba**es.
to the global warming skeptics, look at some hard data.
did you ever trend data in school?
did you go to school?
maybe a tax won't do anything but pad a few pockets.
but at least the owners of those pockets are somewhat ethical.
i would rather my money go to them than thugs ie.
contractors and the warmongers who bought them.
Construction and Demolition Debris (C&D) incinerator planned for your community?
Being told by proponents that air emissions won't harm you or your children?
Stunned that the Waxman-Markey climate bill considers the incineration of C&D to be a clean source of "renewable energy?

Ellen Moyer, principal of Greenvironment, LLC, posesses an M.S.
in Environmental Engineering and a Ph.D. in Civil Engineering.
She is expert in environmental assessment and remediation technologies.
Her Ph.D. research investigated soil vapor extraction, air sparging, and bioventing of gasoline VOCs.
The economically-challenged city of Springfield has been targeted for a 38 MW C&D incinerator by the Palmer Paving company, working, it seems, hand-in-glove with state officials.
Permitting has been fast-tracked for the facility--Ian Bowles, Massachusetts' top environmental official, has ruled that the plant, which proposes to 3.47 tons of lead per year into the atmosphere, need not submit a comprehensive Environmental Impact Report.
The politics are arcane: there's a moratorium on new Municipal Solid Waste incineration capacity in Massachusetts.
C&D wood is categorized as MSW, but is currently banned from being dumped in Massachusetts landfills.
Palmer Paving is applying for a Beneficial Use Determination (BUD) from the state DEP which will re-categorize C&D, for this one plant, as an acceptable biomass fuelstock.
This would certainly be convenient for everyone involved: The Springfield plant proposes to burn two-thirds of the C&D generated in the state of Massachusetts.
And if federal climate legislation passes the Senate with its broad definition of eligible biomass intact, watch out--investors in these toxic incinerators will reap a windfall profit.
In Minneapolis, Neighbors Against the Burner (NAB) are fighting HERC's plans to expand their waste incinerator capacity by 21%.
"We could immediately put these lands to work in helping combat climate change, but Congress must adjust the bill to provide supplemental incentives...for forest management practices that enhance carbon storage.
Such practices include replanting trees, changing timber rotations and avoiding deforestation.
"
Leavell does not oppose support for biomass incineration in the climate bill, and in fact credits Rep. John Barrow (D-Ga.) for "speaking up on behalf of Georgia forest owners and helping make sure the climate bill reported out of the House Energy and Commerce Committee does allow some private U.S. forests to be recognized and supported as a source of biomass for renewable energy.
"
Leavell makes an interesting point.
A climate bill provision that provides incentives for small forest landowners to maintain their properties as carbon sinks could be helpful in the battle against global warming.
If it were easy and economical for the average landowner to generate offsets, pressures to develop land or sacrifice stands of trees to heavy commercial logging would be easier to resist.
WASHINGTON, DC -- The Green Party's national Eco-Action Committee is sharply criticizing an energy bill passed in the US House (HR 2454), calling the legislation dangerously inadequate and a concession to polluting industries.

Earthjustice reports upon a loophole in the house climate bill that "grandfathers" existing coal plants, making them exempt from C02 limits under the Clean Air Act.
Forty-three new coal plants planned or being built in the next five years would escape the bill's performance standards.
"First, the bill allows polluters to take credit for meeting their required pollution reductions by paying farmers, not to put new conservation practices in place, but simply to keep doing what they were already doing.
This could allow the equivalent of over 67 of the dirtiest power plants to avoid any controls on greenhouse gas emissions while missing the opportunity to encourage farmers to do more to protect the climate.
Second, the bill provides no guarantee that key conservation practices that are generating credits for polluters will actually stay in place over the long-term.
"
David Hawkins of the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), in presenting testimony to the US Senate, spoke about the biomass accounting loophole in the climate bill:
The climate wars have begun in the Senate.
Here's a good Reuters article on what to expect .
Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) chairs the Environment and Public Works committee and will be the lead author for the core components of the bill.
Federal agency heads are expressing support for a Senate bill that resembles H.R.
2454 (download pdf) which cleared the House last month by a slim seven-vote margin.
(Using the house bill as a template is not great news for those who oppose green energy status for incineration technologies.
)
Today, (NYTimes report) , Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev) will bring together the heads of six Senate committees: Agriculture's Tom Harkin (Iowa); Commerce, Science and Transportation's John Rockefeller (West Virginia); Energy and Natural Resources' Jeff Bingaman (New Mexico); Environment and Public Works' Barbara Boxer (California); Finance's Max Baucus (Montana); and Foreign Relations' John Kerry (Massachusetts).
It's hard to believe, but these greenhouse-gas polluters are being given a free ride under carbon-accounting conventions proposed by the Waxman-Markey climate bill.
They are also exempt from reporting carbon to the RGGI, or Northeast States Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.
Long story short, the carbon dioxide from these smokestacks, which is higher per megawatt hour than the CO2 emitted by coal plants , will go uncounted.
They are also eligible for renewable energy credits (RECs), federal stimulus money, accelerated depreciation under the tax code, and a host of other subsidies, paid for by you and me.
Stories about massive, misguided subsidies within the climate bill keep pouring in.
Here's a good one from the Washington Independent.
If 28% of American greenhouse gas emissions come from the transportation sector, why does the climate bill provide such paltry support to mass transit?
If lawmakers can afford to give billions of dollars away to help the nation's biggest polluters, why can't they offer support to bus and train systems?
Picked this up from the NYTimes Bloggingheads Opinion Feed.
where a shorter version of the video is available.
Here's the whole thing from www.bloggingheads.tv: Brown University economist Glenn Loury in conversation with the Cato Institute's Brink Lindsey .
Strange times: Lindsey expresses support for a carbon tax, while Loury calls Obama out for a "failure of leadership.
" These two, ostensibly from opposite ends of the political spectrum, do not disagree when it comes to the climate bill.
Wicked Fun.
There is one take away message from my talk today: CO2 is CO2 regardless of the source: whether it comes from burning coal or another material.
One molecule of CO2 is just as dirty as the next, and has the same negative climate change impact.
I will be elaborating on this topic.
The Waxman Markey American Clean Energy and Security Act, H.R.
2454, subsidizes biomass burners that emit 1.5 more CO2 per megawatt than burning coal.
The Bill calls biomass burning “clean and green” and renewable – it is neither.
In my remarks I will focus on Title I, the Renewable Electricity Standard of the 964-page bill, which says biomass burning is a “Renewable Energy Resource.”
To put my remarks in context, President Obama’s Climate Change report issued on Tuesday of this week explicitly reiterates the importance of early cuts in emissions of CO2.
That means a climate change bill should focus on reducing emisisons now, not 10 or 20 years from now.
H.R. 2454 aims to require utilities to purchase 20% of their electricity from renewables by 2020.
Up to 5 percent can come from efficiency improvements.
H.R.
2454 mandates and subsidizes “renewable energy resources” that burn various materials to generate electricity.
Section 101 defines the type of renewable electricity that a utility can use to meet its 20% by 2020 mandate – wind, solar, geothermal, tidal, and “combustion and pyrolization” – the latter two are fancy words for burning.
Section 101(a) identifies the materials that can be burned to generate renewable electricity– there are two basic categories: “renewable biomass” and second, “waste to energy.” Waste to energy includes municipal solid waste, construction and demolition debris, and landfill gas – just about anything you can think of.
Burning biomass and these other materials, by emitting CO2, accelerates the rise in atmospheric CO2.
Burning emits highly toxic air pollutants, including dioxin and mercury, uses large volumes of water for cooling and discharges heated effluent into our rivers, and causes deforestation when wood is used as a fuel.
The bill’s forest protection provisions are weak.
I won’t focus on these but have information available about the other air, water, forestry, and public health impacts.
CO2 emissions from renewable electricity burning are exempt from the “Cap and trade” limits in Title VII.
This CO2 is also exempt from regulation by EPA under H.R.
2454. EPA cannot regulate CO2 from biomass and other types of incinerators being used to generate “renewable electricity.
“ The existence of these two loopholes reflects how the regulatory programs in Massachusetts are being implemented: biomass burning CO2 is exempt from cap and trade, and from regulation in air pollution permits.
Every molecule of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere by energy production should be counted.
It does not matter whether the CO2 comes from a car, a factory or a biomass smokestack – it all has the same impact on climate change.
When the issue of CO2 emissions from biomass is raised, you will hear some in industry assert that generating energy by burning wood is “carbon neutral.” They argue the CO2 emissions don’t count because the carbon in the trees is “biogenic – i.e.
part of the natural carbon cycle and that emitting CO2 by burning a tree has the same global warming impact as emitting the same amount of CO2 as when the tree decomposes over time.
This is a red herring defies common sense.
Burning emits a sudden burst of carbon in to the atmosphere-this is a man-made, anthropogenic, not a natural, event, and is therefore not “biogenic.” It is this CO2 emitted into the air now that impacts climate change today and that has to be addressed now.
Also, you will hear from some in industry that the carbon is all part of the “biosphere” – i.e.
the world - but what counts is the amount of carbon in the biosphere that is in the atmosphere.
The reality it that what matters to global warming is the number of molecules in the atmosphere today, not in the overall biosphere.
Burning trees to generate electricity as an antitode to climate change is a double blow to the battle to slow global warming: Burning a tree produces CO2, and every tree that is burned eliminates a tree that can resequester carbon.
David Hawkins is the Director of Climate Programs at the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC).
NRDC is a national, nonprofit organization of scientists, lawyers and environmental specialists dedicated to protecting public health and the environment.
Hawkins was one of several experts who testified before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee , chaired by California's Barbara Boxer, on July 7.
"The loophole is created by not requiring covered sources to account for the life-cycle emissions of biomass and biofuels.
In other words, if a coal power plant replaces half of its coal with biomass, it has to hold carbon allowances for only half of its pollution.
This makes sense only on the assumption that 100 percent of the carbon dioxide released when the biomass is burned was taken up from the atmosphere during its production.
That assumption is true when biomass is grown in a sustainable, low-carbon manner.
It is not true if biomass is taken from old growth forests or other practices that result in large releases of sequestered carbon into the atmosphere before the fuel reaches the power plant.
A rational, environmentally-sound market for bioenergy would account for these upstream carbon emissions.
The marketplace would then favor sustainable, low-carbon sources of biomass, and shun those that make our climate problem worse.
The biomass loophole will encourage ineffective “junk” biomass, disadvantaging and punishing providers of sound biomass.
It also punishes providers of other low-carbon energy – wind and solar, for example – and even hurts providers of fossil energy who have to incur the cost of carbon allowances, while no allowances would be required if the source switched to bioenergy...
This invocation of absent authority is not a unique phenomenon--Developer Matthew Wolfe, when presenting Pioneer Renewable Energy's Plans to build a large wood-burning plant in Greenfield, called upon the name of the IPCC (International Panel on Climate Change) in his attempts to convince the crowd that his incinerator would be "carbon-neutral.
"
Contact your senators to let them know that incineration technologies should not receive renewable energy subsidies under federal climate and global warming legislation.
We disagree.
Full, honest carbon accounting would reveal these plants as greenhouse gas polluters.
One of the strongest arguments for passing a climate and clean energy bill is that it will boost the economy and create jobs.
He discusses some of the frustrations and some of the challenges ahead, such as protecting California's climate change law from a hostile ballot initiative in November's election.
He also looks at bright spots, such as the growing support for climate action within the business community.
He closes by putting this moment in a historical context:
A report released this week by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) provides new evidence that global warming continues relentlessly.
The report comes after climate science was found to be solid in several official investigations into the so-called “Climategate” controversy, and it adds even more urgency to the need to reduce global warming pollution to prevent severe impacts in the future.
The report, "State of the Climate in 2009," was authored by more than 300 scientists from 160 research groups in 48 countries.
It confirms that each of the past three decades was warmer than the last, with the 2000s being the warmest in the 150-year record.
The latest data from all the regions of the world are presented for a variety of climate indicators.
Ten of the indicators most closely related to surface temperature all support the idea that the Earth is warming.
These climate indicators represent many independent lines of evidence for global warming.
This report comes on top of a set of recent reports by the National Academy of Sciences that provide yet more evidence that human-produced pollution has caused the warming observed over the past several decades and that continued warming poses serious and costly risks to society.
Together, these latest scientific reports show that global warming is happening and will only get worse unless we seriously cut back our global warming pollution.
As evidenced yet again by the new NOAA report, the science is very clear: We must begin cutting our emissions now to avoid even more dramatic cuts later, since global warming gases stay in the atmosphere for decades or even centuries and keep accumulating there.
A delay of two or three years will make the necessary pollution cuts more severe and expensive.
What a long, hard road it has been getting Congress to pass a strong climate and energy bill.
I regret to say that the news is not especially good, though the door is not yet completely closed.
Because of this, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has announced that the Senate will not take up a limit on global warming pollution before the August recess, though it "may" consider it in September.
The Crisis Isn't Going Away: 2010 is on pace to become the warmest year on record, following the warmest decade on record: 2000-2009.
Glacial and polar ice continues to melt at astonishing rates, worsening the threat of sea level rise, coastal flooding, and threatening the supply of drinking water for hundreds of millions of people around the world.
Year by year and decade by decade, these and other very serious trends will get worse and worse with no end in sight.
Inaction Now Only Makes It Harder Later: Science, not politics, is ultimately in charge of this crisis.
And the science is very clear.
We must begin cutting our emissions now to avoid even more dramatic cuts later.
A delay of two or three years only makes the necessary pollution cuts all the more severe and disruptive to our economy and way of life.
Global warming is the most serious environmental threat facing the planet and will remain our top organizational priority, one which we will continue to take on in a variety of ways, including:
Wherever there is a serious effort to cut global warming pollution, we will be there, fighting for the strongest possible solution.
The hour is late and the window for Senate action this year is closing.
But, whatever the future holds, we will continue to fight to prevent the catastrophic threat of run-away global warming.

Not surprisingly, a number of blogs today talked about Senator Reid’s (D–Nev.
) statement that he’ll move forward with a somewhat scaled-back energy bill.
The legislation is slated to include a response to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill and energy efficiency incentives, but omit a carbon cap or many of the broader climate change measures that were part of the House version of the bill.
For the state of play, CleanTechies includes a helpful bulleted list of “highlights of legislation introduced in the Senate that may contribute language to the final package.”
The Vine questions the political strategy of splitting a response to the oil spill from a broader energy and climate bill while acknowledging that an oil spill response is far more likely to receive the bipartisan support necessary for passage.
Post Partisan regrets that the Senate is passing on what it calls “the most efficient policy available – placing a price on carbon.” On Firedoglake, David Dayen says the oil spill response must move, irrespective of the fate of the larger climate and energy bill.
We need to harness the power of private sector investment if we hope to see long-term growth and job creation.
And the best way to do that is through a clean energy bill with a limit on carbon pollution.
As Fred Krupp, the president of Environmental Defense Fund, notes: U.S. utility companies today “are sitting on billions of dollars in job-creating capital — but they will not invest in new energy projects until they have certainty on what their future carbon obligations will be.
In just one state, Indiana, there are 25 power plants 50 years old or older.
The fleet needs to be modernized, and Senate paralysis is keeping it from happening.
A recent study from the Peterson Institute projects annual investment in the sector in the next 10 years would rise by 50 percent as a result of climate legislation — an increase of nearly $11 billion a year.”
The bottom line: If we pass a climate and clean energy bill with a carbon cap, we’ll create jobs without increasing deficit spending.
In its editorial, “ Energy savings and the climate and energy bill ,” The Keene Sentinel starts with discussion of local efforts to cut energy use in government buildings but stresses that these alone aren’t enough, pivoting onto a discussion of the climate bill.
The piece is particularly interesting in that in targets Senator Judd Gregg (R-N.H.), whose support could be vital to the bill’s success:
[Gregg is] done with campaigning now — this is his last summer in the Senate — and he should feel comfortable in his coloration, and join the majority in support of the bill.
In recent years, advances have been made in the energy and climate arenas; he can help assure more such advances by backing the bill.
The Voices of a New Clean Energy Future is a series from individuals who understand the importance of passing comprehensive climate and clean energy legislation – business leaders, politicians, policy experts, and concerned citizens like you.
EDF is proud to highlight their voices and contributions to the climate and energy debate.
In response to reports that senators are considering adding a low carbon fuel standard (LCFS) into the pending climate and energy bill, Michael Levi blogged about what impact this might have on the legislation, potential obstacles and opportunities.
While he lauds the goal of reducing emissions, he recommends adding a price ceiling on the tradable permits refiners, blenders, and importers would be required to hold.
As the debate on climate legislation gears up in the Senate, evidence continues to accumulate that a climate bill will be affordable and provide a much-needed boost to our economy.
A new analysis released by the Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration (EIA) of the comprehensive climate and energy legislation introduced by Senators Kerry and Lieberman (the American Power Act or APA), confirmed that under the bill, the American economy would continue to grow robustly, and the cost to households would be minimal.
Here are the facts:
Under climate policy, U.S. GDP would grow by a third over the period 2008-2020, and would nearly double by 2035.
A “business as usual” scenario with no climate policy would add only a tiny fraction to output — just two-tenths of a percent (0.2%) in total over the next two decades.
To put this in perspective, GDP is projected to reach $27.8 trillion by New Year’s Day 2035 under business as usual; under climate policy, it will get there by the middle of February.
Under climate policy, U.S. employment is projected to grow 8% by 2020 and 22% by 2035, relative to 2008.
Allowance prices in 2020 and 2030 are even lower than EIA projected under the House-passed climate legislation (HR2454).
All of EIA’s projections are consistent with an array of estimates from the most credible analyses available, in particular, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) .
EPA’s estimates for the cost to the average American household are comparable to EIA’s (amounting to just a few dollars a month for the average individual American).
And just last week, CBO reported that APA would reduce future deficits by approximately $19 billion over the next decade.
It also estimated even lower allowance prices under APA than under HR2454, which CBO also projected would cost the average American just a few dollars a month by the year 2020.
That is a small investment in a clean energy economy that will create jobs, reduce pollution and increase America’s energy security.
And it’s always important to remember that all of these analyses only look at one side of the ledger – they do not take into account the huge costs of inaction on climate change.
Studies like those from EIA, EPA, and CBO confirm that we can readily afford a comprehensive climate and energy bill that would boost our economy, reduce our dependence on imported oil and help avert dangerous climate change.
There is no more time to waste – the Senate needs to pass a cap on carbon now.
Climate 411 is the voice of the experts at Environmental Defense Fund, providing plain-English explanations of climate change science, technology, policy, and news.
Despite many promises and strong support from president Obama, US still failed to pass cap-and- trade legislation, as there is still not enough political will for such action, or as some others would say fossil fuels lobbies are still too powerful.
The only somewhat good news came from climate negotiator Todd Stern who recently said that despite the failure of cap-and-trade legislation US won’t change its target for 2020 to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by approximately 17 percent.
If you follow what's happening with climate change legislation in United States then you already know that The House approved a bill last year to set limits on carbon emissions linked to climate change but this bill stalled in Senate.
Though cap-and-trade legislation would be more than welcome passing this bill will take some time, and in the meantime Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) needs to step in, and use existing laws to at least regulate some sources of carbon pollution.
By the current looks of it, EPA will not be afraid to use these laws, and the EPA regulation planned for next year will set the U.S.’s first nationwide limits on greenhouse-gas pollution in the effort to curb global warming.
This is a clear sign that EPA will continue pushing forward towards the adequate climate change legislation.
Many political analysts believe that the adequate domestic climate change legislation is the key to success to the international climate deal.
Copenhagen was yet another big failure on international stage, mainly because US failed to give positive examples to other countries.
Hopefully, this situation will soon improve.
The majority of scientists believes that climate change is not only the real thing but that we are also yet to see the worst the climate change has to offer.
Climate change is already there and we need to adapt to it as quickly as possible.
This lead us to a question can today's science also predict what will our future climate look like?
My answer is no, there are too much factors that affect our climate so scientists despite all their efforts are still far away from being able to predict future climate change.
Scientists have already discovered bunch of different factors that have serious impact on climate change, and there are probably many factors that are yet to be discovered, not to mention finding interlinking between these factors.
In other words, climate change phenomenon is still too complex for today's science.
Yes, ice is melting, and yes, temperatures are rising on global level but how much will temperature rise in years to come is impossible to tell.
Increase in global temperature isn't only connected with the amount of carbon emissions but with many other factors, and only by incorporating all these factors we could be able to give some decent prediction.
The problem?
We still don't know half of these factors so we can't really set the equation.
Climate change science is still pretty much tapping in the dark hoping that somewhere there's the right switch to turn the lights on.
What this basically means is that we are still swimming in theory waters, meaning that there are many possible scenarios for future climate change.
The only bad thing is that most of these scenarios were made for the disaster movies.
There are some scientists who do not totally agree with this theory claiming that this calculation won't work if the balance of factors causing global warming changes significantly.
There are several different factors that will have significant effect on the amount of rainfall in years to come such as the level of solar radiation, the amount of greenhouse gases, etc.
One of the less known but still very important factors are dark aerosols that have the ability to absorb enough sunlight in the atmosphere to suppress the expected rainfall response to increased temperatures, and the immediate result of this could be less rainfall.
When discussing this rather interesting topic Dr Timothy Andrews, scientist at the University of Leeds, said that two effects should be counted together because they go in tandem: "a fast atmospheric response that is closely linked with the type of climate change mechanism, and a slower response to surface temperature change that happens regardless of the climate change mechanism.
"
According to him these slow effects do produce the predicted 2-3 per cent increase in rainfall but fast atmospheric response might change all of this, depending on factors involved (such as dark aerosols).
Climate change protests are becoming more frequent in Australia and many hope that this will create enough political pressure to urge the major political parties to take action on climate change.
The politicians still fail to adequately punish big polluters, and many people believe that the time has come for politicians to step up and take responsibility because climate change needs quick action.
The public is very disappointed with false promises, constant delays, and wants to see real action in form of strict laws that would curb carbon pollution in Australia.
There were also dozens of climate change skeptics who tried to disrupt rally in some cities but they failed to do so.
The only thing they managed to do was to create minor incidents which police had to break up.
These events could be very helpful because many politicians will be forced to listen what their voters want from them, and perhaps politics will become more ignorant to powerful fossil fuel lobbies that delay major political decisions connected with climate change.
If you ask climate change scientists about the connection between climate change and ocean circulation many of them will tell you that there is a very strong connection between these two.
A team of scientists from the University of Cardiff has managed to find the evidence which connects fluctuations in ocean circulation to the climate change and temperature.
The primary focus of their study was Atlantic meridional overturning circulation that carries tropical surface waters northwards, and cold deep water from the North Atlantic southwards to fill the Atlantic basin.
In Atlantic basin this water gets mixed with deep waters that originate in the Antarctic region.
Climate change scientists already know that in times when ocean circulation is strong, heat is moved efficiently from the tropics to the poles, and when the circulation is weak the poles become colder.
Scientists believe that that during particularly cold periods in the last ice age Atlantic meridional overturning circulation was very weakened, and when this circulation strengthens after a period of weak circulation, it doesn't just return to its "normal" extent but it gets stronger than before.
So many factors influence climate change, and ocean circulation looks to be among the most important ones.
I typically do not re-post articles, but yesterday's piece is the Guardian is noteworthy.
Titled " Canada's image in tatters " the article details at length Canada's roll as a corrupt petro-state, and the litany of damage our nation has caused to climate change negotiations.
Until now I believed that the nation that has done most to sabotage a new climate change agreement was the United States.
I was wrong.
The real villain is Canada.
Unless we can stop it, the harm done by Canada in December 2009 will outweigh a century of good works.
In 2006 the new Canadian government announced it was abandoning its targets to cut greenhouse gases under the Kyoto protocol.
No other country that had ratified the treaty has done this.
Canada was meant to have cut emissions by 6% between 1990 and 2012.
Instead they have already risen by 26%.... the future cut Canada has volunteered is smaller than that of any other rich nation.
After giving the finger to Kyoto, Canada then set out to prevent the other nations striking a successor agreement.
At the end of 2007, it singlehandedly blocked a Commonwealth resolution to support binding targets for industrialised nations.
After the climate talks in Poland in December 2008, it won the Fossil of the Year award, presented by environmental groups to the country that had done most to disrupt the talks.
The climate change performance index, which assesses the efforts of the world's 60 richest nations, was published in the same month.
Saudi Arabia came 60th.
Canada came 59th.
And nowhere is this issue more relevant than with respect to climate change, a crisis that most Canadians feel, " is the planet's defining crisis ".
That question was eventually answered by Interface's Mission Zero, a formalized corporate vision to make the company fully sustainable by the year 2020.
They have come along way towards that goal.
Over the past 15 years while governments and industries in the United States insisted that the 7% reduction in greenhouse gases called for by the Kyoto Protocol would destroy the economy, Interface lowered theirs by 71% while increasing sales by two thirds and doubling earnings.
However, the magnitude of each person's responsibility is also proportionate to the amount of impact they are responsible for creating.
Ray Anderson stands apart not for his environmental awareness, but because he took the rare approach of both confronting the full impact of his petroleum based business, and accepting a level of responsibility that was equal to this impact.
Last week, Ecojustice launched stopsoot.ca - a video campaign that calls on the Canadian government to stop the number two cause of global warming, black carbon emissions otherwise known as soot.
That call to action is also being echoed by the man who one a Nobel prize for sounding the alarm about the ozone layer - Dr Mario Molina.
Dr. Molina and other leaders at the National Academy of Sciences have stated that reducing soot (black carbon) could slow global warming by as much as two decades and help give the world time to reduce greenhouse gas pollution and stabilize our warming climate.
Researchers consider black carbon (soot) an ideal target for achieving quick mitigation because it only remains in the atmosphere a few days to a few weeks and can be reduced by expanding the use of diesel particulate filters for
dung and wood.
With indoor air pollution killing 1.6 million people a year, global action to cut soot emissions would reap major benefits for both public health and climate.
"If we reduce black carbon emissions worldwide by 50 percent by fully deploying all available emissions-control technologies, we could delay the warming effects of CO2 by one to two decades and at the same time greatly improve the health of those living in heavily polluted regions," said Dr. Ramanathan.
The report wants efforts to reduce C02 to be complimented by strategies that can have an immediate impact in the atmosphere like stopping soot and reducing other non-CO2 climate change agents.
I agree.
There was a major development over the weekend in the case of a US research vessel, RV Marcus Langseth, seeking to conduct seismic testing in Canada's first marine protected area.
While the Canadian government is refusing to comment on a decision that threatens blue whales and the integrity of the nation's first marine protected area , environmentalists ARE fuming - and rightfully so.
The federal government's own documents demonstrate a full awareness of the impacts this testing will have on endangered whales, and they have allowed this research to go forward regardless of the best science available.
Ecojustice is suing the federal government to stop an American research vessel from conducting seismic blasting in a Canadian waters.
The area in question?
The Endeavour Hydrothermal Vents , Canada's first officially designated marine protected area and a known habitat of endangered blue whales and fin whales.
“A marine protected area is a marine protected area because its supposed to be off limits to harmful activity.
And its just completely inappropriate that intrusive or harmful research would happen there,” said Ecojustice lawyer, Lara Tessaro.
The ultimate threat to a country is loosing its ground to the ocean.
Whether or not you are convinced of anthropogenic global warming are you ready to give millions of climate refugees a new home?
Would you offer a room within your house?
Michael Nash’s film “Climate Refugees” is a compelling look at the millions of humans displaced by disasters arising from incremental and rapid ecological changes to the environment and more frequent extreme weather events such as hurricanes, cyclones, fires and tornadoes.
A full GOES East picture from yesterday 18:45 UTC.
Currently a Cat 2 Hurricane, one tropical depression and one pre-depression is in the same Atlantic basin.
Fortunately all are far away from making landfall.
Accompaigned by two ice-breakers the vessel arrived yesterday in the East Siberian Sea and final destination is Ningbo in China.
Now that the Arctic sea ice concentration on the Bering Sea side is very irregular, it might be interesting to see the actual extent combined with latest radar image and analyze which areas are close to the 15% threshold.
The extent of the sea ice in the Arctic will reach its annual minimum in September.
Forecasts indicate that it will not be as low as in 2007, the year of the smallest area covered by sea ice since satellites started recording such data.
Nevertheless, sea ice physicists at the Alfred Wegener Institute are concerned about the long-term equilibrium in the Arctic Ocean.
They have indications that the mass of sea ice is dwindling because its thickness is declining.
To substantiate this, they are currently measuring the ice thickness north and east of Greenland using the research aircraft Polar 5.
The objective of the roughly one-week campaign is to determine the export of sea ice from the Arctic.
Around a third to half of the freshwater export from the Arctic Ocean takes place in this way – a major drive factor in the global ocean current system.
On August 8, 2010 devastating landslides and floods buried a densely populated area in the center of the city of Zhouqu .
As of August 20, CNN reported 1,407 deaths and 358 people still missing.
The landslide is linked to the construction of hydro-electric power plants, mining, deforestation and finally triggered by unusually intense monsoon.
An ice island weighing many millions of tonnes break off the northern hemisphere’s largest glacier yesterday.
Most of the glaciers calving into the warming Arctic Sea are on the decline.
The shipwreck of HMS Investigator was located by Parks Canada archaeologists in the first moments of the search.
Upon the arrival of the project team, ice had been pushed back inside Mercy Bay and the side-scan search had to be delayed.
Stormy, cloudy, and relatively cool weather persisted through the month, which helped slow the rate of ice loss.
The daily rate of decline for July was 77,000 square kilometers (29,700 square miles) per day, close to the 1979 to 2000 average of 84,400 square kilometers (32,600 square miles).
At the heart of Greenpeace’s report ‘ Left in the dust: Areva's radioactive legacy in the desert towns of Niger ’ is the human cost of nuclear power.
If we are going to embrace nuclear power then, every time you flick a switch and nuclear-powered light bulb comes on, you must accept the suffering of the likes of the people who live around Areva’s uranium mines in Niger (and those people are by no means the only people to suffer at the hands of the nuclear industry).
This is what the nuclear industry wants us to forget.
According to them, nuclear power is just a matter ‘safe’, ‘clean’ and ‘reliable’ reactors producing ‘low carbon’ electricity.
They don’t want to think about where the fuel for those reactors come from, about the contaminated streets of Arlit and Akokan.
They don’t want you to think about the people of Niger trapped at the bottom of the United Nation’s Human Development Index .
Funnily enough, journalists were not so keen on approaching the big cement barrel at the right corner of the room where the samples were safely guarded.
Of course there was no danger in doing so as everything was cautiously sealed and manipulated, but nuclear radiations is a serious and even scary topic.
Nuclear energy, from the very bottom of the chain with the mining, to the processing and storage of nuclear waste is a danger for human health and the environment.
(This post is by Anne-Laure Meladeck, Climate & Energy Officer for Greenpeace International)
Uranium mines in Niger operated by the state-owned French nuclear giant AREVA continue to create a radioactive hazard for the people living nearby.
A new report released today by Greenpeace reveals contamination levels in the air, water and soil above internationally accepted limits.
“Radioactivity increases poverty because it creates more victims.
With each day passes we are exposed to radiation and continue to be surrounded by poisoned air, polluted water and earth – while AREVA makes hundreds of millions from our natural resources.” said Almoustapha Alhacen, President of the local Nigerian NGO Aghir in’ Man (which means “the shield of the soul” in the Touareg language, is a local environmental and human rights organization).
“The analysis we have performed show that the uranium contamination in four out of five water samples exceed World Health Organisation safety limits*.
We found evidence of radon, a radioactive gas dissolved in water and also chemical elements.
Even so, this water is still being distributed to the population and the workers for consumption” said Bruno Chareyron, an engineer in Nuclear Physics from CRIIRAD.
Half of AREVA's uranium comes from two mines in Niger, one of Africa's poorest countries despite being the world's third largest uranium producer for more than 40 years.
Areva, has also signed a deal to start tapping a third mine in the desert nation from 2013 or 2014.
“AREVA claims that it is an environmentally friendly company are not borne out in reality, the shocking levels of contamination in Niger reveal the truth.
AREVA must take immediate action to end the routine radioactive contamination of villages surrounding their Nigerien mines.” said Rianne Teule, Greenpeace International nuclear campaigner.“ AREVA must also put in place long-term health monitoring of the local population.”
Greenpeace is calling for an independent study around the mines and mining towns in Niger followed by a thorough clean up and decontamination.
AREVA must take responsibility for its actions not only in Niger, but worldwide.
"Nuclear power is enjoying growing acceptance as a stable and clean source of energy that can help to mitigate the impact of climate change," Amano told the meeting at U.N. headquarters in New York.
"Nuclear power must be accessible not only for developed countries but also for developing countries.
"
We’ll leave for the moment Amano’s deceitful propaganda about nuclear power being ‘ stable ’ and ‘ clean ’ and able to ‘ mitigate the impact of climate change ’.
He says more than 60 countries are considering adopting nuclear power.
Could the IAEA monitor them all?
Some of the countries on the Amano’s list are barely stable let alone functional, accountable democracies.
‘RALEIGH - Fifty years ago, it was widely believed that nuclear power might provide the answer to all of the world's energy needs by providing a clean, safe, and virtually endless supply of affordable electricity.
Two decades or so later, of course, the bloom on the nuclear rose had quickly wilted under the weight of the spiraling costs, worries about weapons proliferation and the storage of waste byproducts, and, of course, the disasters at Chernobyl and Three Mile Island.
As a result, there has not been a new nuclear power plant ordered in the United States since 1977.
Recently, Dr. Hugh Haskell, a Senior Science Fellow at the Maryland-based Institute for Energy and Environmental Research and Instructor of Physics, emeritus, at the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics prepared a detailed paper on the subject.
Haskell's paper was a thoughtful reply to a passionately pro-nuclear speech delivered last fall by U.S. Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee.
"If it should turn out that nuclear power is indeed that solution, then I would advocate for nuclear power ardently.
But the facts as I see them are that nuclear power, due to its environmental footprint, its contribution to weapons proliferation, its cost, its excessive use of water, and the time it will take to build up what we would need to meet the needs of the planet, is simply not the best way to go, and will end up replacing one intractable problem with another, perhaps even more intractable.
Other more environmentally friendly means are available to us now that can do what we need to do in a timely manner without excessive costs, and are consistent with the need to work toward a sustainable society-one not built on growth forever.

"Putting iron in the ocean is dumping.
It's pollution.
"
The important thing to realize is that this technique, while it may be normally discussed in relation to carbon dioxide removal, is primarily an ocean restoration process...a potential "reversal" of damage we've already done (and are doing) to the oceans.
We do such restoration every day, routinely, on land.
We restore damaged ecosystems in fields, forests,and swamps.
In an extensive and detailed exposition on the new web site , George makes the case that damage to the oceans due to a sudden spike in acidification is happening much faster than anyone is willing to admit, and that iron fertilization is the only solution that can stop it.
From an email interview, George says:
“Even if society does not emit one single molecule more fossil CO2 the oceans will acidify to death from the CO2 already in the atmosphere... no amount of reducing our carbon footprint will suffice... Not even ceasing all fossil fuel use today…ONLY ecorestoration and replenished and renewed photosynthesis offers any hope at all.”
There seem to be thousands of climate change people who consider do nothing to be an acceptable strategy.
It's nice to see one person, or perhaps even two people, who are trying to do something.
Hey, even with a thousand-to-one ratio of do nothing people to do something people, at least we have some chance for a valid scientifically accurate debate, right?
If Climos and Planktos are to be believed, it has the potential to remove vast amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, a process that by any measure is worth many billions of dollars per year, at least.
The Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) ad hoc Consultative Group on Ocean Fertilization is concerned that the statement on ocean fertilization activities issued by the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biodiversity in Bonn on 30 May 2008 places unnecessary and undue restriction on legitimate scientific activities.
The statement reads, in part, "[The Conference of the Parties of the Convention on Biodiversity (COP of the CBD)] ... urges other Governments, in accordance with the precautionary approach, to ensure that ocean fertilization activities do not take place until there is an adequate scientific basis on which to justify such activities, including assessing associated risks, and a global transparent and effective control and regulatory mechanism is in place for these activities; with the exception of small scale research studies within coastal waters.
" The IOC ad hoc Consultative Group on Ocean Fertilization notes that:
(4) We are concerned about the phrase in the CBD statement "global transparent and effective control and regulatory mechanism … for these activities".
We assume that “these activities” refers to ocean fertilization activities for the purpose of introducing additional carbon dioxide into the ocean, as distinct from purposes such as legitimate scientific investigation.
It would be helpful if this phrase were clarified to make this important distinction evident
(5) Preservation of biodiversity in marine systems may require good scientific information from manipulative experiments in the open ocean.
A careful science-based "assessment of associated risks" depends on knowledge that could be gained by further experimentation.
(6) It is essential for sound and unbiased scientific advice to be available to intergovernmental deliberations on the issue of ocean fertilization both to protect the marine environment and to ensure that marine scientific research is not unnecessarily hindered.
The IOC should continue to provide scientific advice to the London Convention Scientific Group, as well as other international or intergovernmental deliberations, as requested.
IOC Programme Specialist in the Ocean Sciences Section, Dr Maria Hood, will introduce this item.
Given the prominence and impact of the IPCC Assessment Report 4, the successful positioning by the UN of the Climate Change issue on top of the international agenda, and in view of the ongoing negotiations for a post 2012 agreement on the Climate Change regime under UNFCCC, ocean iron fertlization has received renewed attention.
The IOC was created in 1960 to promote international cooperation and coordinate programmes in research, sustainable development, protection of the marine environment, capacity-building for improved management, and decision-making.
It assists developing countries in strengthening their institutions to obtain self-driven sustainability in marine sciences.
On a regional level, it is coordinating the development of tsunami early warning and mitigation systems in the Pacific, the Indian Ocean, the North-eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean, and the Caribbean.
It also facilitates interagency coordination through the UN-Oceans mechanism and works with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in establishing a process for global reporting and assessment of the state of the marine environment.
Through the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS)—the ocean component of the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS)—the IOC helps improve operational oceanography, weather and climate forecasts and monitoring and support the sustained observing needs of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
The IOC Executive Council elected in 2007 will meet at the IOC Headquarters in Paris on 24 June – 1 July 2008.
The forty Member States that will convene for the 41st session of the Executive Council will have in front of them a rich and challenging agenda.
They will consider the results of the first session of the Working Group on the Future of IOC, tasked with identifying options for enhancing the role of IOC in terms of institutional arrangements, financial resources, and relations with other intergovernmental and international organizations.
The Executive Council will also discuss and adopt a programme of activities for the celebration of the 50th anniversary of IOC in 2010 that will take stock of the achievements of the Commission as well as current and future needs in terms of ocean science, observations and capacity-building.
Among other items on the agenda before the Executive Council include an Operational Plan for the 2008–2009 biennium, the identification of possible activities in the area of marine ecosystems, and the coordination of regional tsunami early warning systems.
Offer to Purchase (Klimafa) On February 1, 2008 the Company and Planktos, Inc. executed an Offer to Purchase with Dr. David Gazdag to document the sale of Planktos, Inc.'s sixty percent (60%) interest in Klimafa S.A. ("Klimafa"), a company focused on the sequestration of carbon dioxide with the planting of new forests.
The disposition closed effective February 21, 2008 with the execution of an Agreement on Transfer of Business Shares.
annum, convertible into sequestered tones of carbon dioxide credits and the right to participate in any new financing arrangements for Klimafa.
On January 21, 2008, the Company entered into a letter of intent with the St Petersburg Environmental Research Center ("SPERC") to sell its research vessel the Weatherbird II according to certain terms and conditions in exchange for a purchase price of $1,000,000 of which $100,000 was paid on acceptance of the letter of intent.
Further to mutual agreement, the terms of the letter of intent were subsequently assigned to Sperc Explorer, Inc. The balance of the purchase price was paid to the Company on February 29, 2008 at which time title to the Weatherbird II passed to Sperc Explorer, Inc.
The Company's Board of Directors has decided to abandon any future ocean fertilization efforts that were once intended to restore marine plant life and generate ecological offsets for the global carbon credit market.
Due to \widespread opposition to plankton restoration in the environmental world, the Company has encountered serious difficulty in raising the capital needed to fund a series of ocean research trials.
The result being that the Company has been forced to let all employees go and will close its Foster City, California office at the end of this month.

Burning forests to produce electricity threatens to destroy and further diminish many of America and the world's forests.
Protection and regeneration of forests, soils, freshwater, climate and biodiversity are urgent global imperatives, and creating massive new demands for any natural plant material is misguided and will further degrade ecosystems.
Achieving global ecological sustainability [search] requires that renewable energy be defined as "no biomass/no burning".
A campaign is growing in Massachusetts, and across the United States and world, against burning wood and other biomass in giant incinerators to produce electricity.
This northeast U.S. state claims to be a leader in renewable energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions yet is fast-tracking three large biomass plants to generate 135 megawatts of power in Western Massachusetts, with other plants under discussion.
There is no scientific evidence that incinerating wood or trash is clean and green.
Biomass burning is exempt from greenhouse gas accounting regulations, yet the plants generate 50% more CO2 per megawatt than burning coal.
Shockingly, MA's plants are being billed as an antidote to global warming as part of the state's "renewable portfolio standards" under its "Global Warming Solutions Act".
In fact, the proposed biomass would establish incinerators that would immediately increase carbon emissions, making global warming much worse, and also set the stage to eventually deforest much of the region.
Anything that furthers the cutting of dwindling ecosystems, and pollution associated with burning, in the production of electricity should not be considered clean, green or renewable.
Protecting and regenerating forests, ecosystems and soils is the most important step we must take if we are to stabilize the global climate.
As policy makers seek to expand mandates for renewable energy, it is essential that the focus remain upon true renewables such as wind, solar and ocean derived technologies; and excludes burning or refining plant biomass, garbage or landfill gases.
Support the growing U.S. coalition in demanding “no biomass/no burning” in definitions of renewable energy.
U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu's speech last week advocating painting rooftops and roadways white to reflect sunlight may be yet another attempt to test the international waters on the controversial subject of geoengineering [search] .
[1] "We need an unequivocal statement from the White House that the U.S. Government is not green-lighting geoengineering in the run-up to Copenhagen," said Pat Mooney, Executive Director of ETC Group, an Ottawa-based civil society organization monitoring new technologies.
The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) meets in Denmark this December; UNFCCC subsidiary bodies are meeting this week and next in Bonn, Germany.
"Benign as a new planetary paint job may appear, white rooftops may be the thin edge of the wedge - a technology that seems harmless but that opens the door to riskier geoengineering schemes," suggests Mooney.
[2] Geoengineering refers to the intentional, large-scale manipulation of the earth's environment, primarily to counteract the effects of climate change.
The ecological science continues to accumulate that abrupt, deadly and irreversible climate collapse [search] is well advanced and accelerating.
One new study finds climate is changing more quickly and deeply then predicted [ ark ] in recent IPCC reports [search] .
Dramatic Arctic melting [search] (including Greenland) and feedbacks far beyond those expected is noted.
Another study concludes that today's greenhouse gas emissions will continue to heat up the planet for hundreds of thousands of years [ ark ], in human terms essentially forever.
This comes as world governments head to Poland for yet another climate conference, to whine about poor economic growth and why they can't possibly cut their own carbon emissions, demanding instead that others address this terrible emergency.
When the ecological bubble bursts we all die.
Greenhouse gases hit a record level last year [ ark ], well beyond what threatens the habitability of the Earth for humans and all creatures.
And indications are that most global citizens are prepared to sacrifice [ ark | more \ ark ] and pay some price to avert the worst effects of abrupt climate changes [search] .
"43% of the 12,000 respondents of the survey chose climate change ahead of the global economy when asked about their current concerns.
" This constitutes a global mandate for climate action.
Where are our leaders?
The U.S. is not listening to the people [ ark ], Italy desperately clings to the past [ ark ], Australia blames others [ ark] and China and India shirk their responsibilities [ ark ].
Globally tens of trillions of dollars are being spent to prop up an economic system based upon the environmental impossibility of maintaining exponential economic growth forever [search] , the same growth that has caused the climate and other environmental problems.
How ridiculous for governments to tax their citizens to pay failed banks to lend to already over-extended consumers.
It is all coming down baby.
The only question is whether we will have the will, strength and remaining ecosystems to reconstitute truly civilized, equitable and just sustainable societies.
Or will we enter an era of barbarism in vain attempts to first continue our over consumption (based upon continued ecosystem destruction) and then just to survive.
The human family's future and prospects for shared survival is being determined now.
This comes as the International Energy Agency confirms that coal will continue being the leading source of energ y globally until at least 2030 [ ark ].
A week earlier in their annual report that had warned that the world's energy use was "patently unsustainable" [ ark ] and warned of 6°C rise in average global temperatures [ ark ].
As long as coal is burned to produce electricity, dumping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, there is zero chance of maintaining historically reliable climatic patterns or a habitable Earth.
Arctic melting leading to methane release [ ark | more \ ark ] -- a major climate change feedback -- has kicked in again after an eight year hiatus, indicating a major quickening of the climate crisis.
A global study in Geophysical Research Letters found a major increase in methane levels of about 28 million tonnes since mid-2006 due to release of gas in and near the Arctic.
Methane is responsible for some 20% of global warming -- and Arctic warming is melting permafrost, leading to increased bacterial emissions from wetland areas.
Indications are frozen methane clathrates found on the ocean floors [search] are also melting .The finding comes as research published in Nature Geoscience found solid evidence that temperatures are rising in Antarctica [ ark ] as well, and that climate change there and in the Arctic was conclusively caused by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gas.
Less rigorous ecological proposals acquiesce to the inevitability of global ecological collapse and are just as guilty as the industrial growth machine's destroyers in ensuring the demise of being.
It is well past time for each of us to embrace both a personal and social revolutionary spirit of action -- as we both reduce our own environmental impact, and join with those intensifying global ecological protest [ ark ].
Shared survival depends upon successfully demanding these and other ecologically sufficient measures are swiftly adopted.
A new report indicates the US West is heating up [ ark] almost twice as fast as the rest of the world, causing severe drought [search] conditions, while threatening cities.
Gee, who would have thunk ?
You mean building metropolises in the desert with little more than the mid-sized Colorado River and diminishing mountain snowpack to provide water is not a good idea?
Add to this ostentatious water use for agriculture and temperate gardens, and automobile and air conditioner dependent communities causing further warming (and you guessed it, much of the electricity powered by hydro dams), and all the ingredients are in place for apocalyptic ecological collapse.
Much of Western development on arid and other ecologically sensitive lands was gravely ecologically misinformed.
I expect these cities to be depopulated within decades.
How soon sanity and ecological knowledge comes to our economic growth, land use and energy policies will determine whether their population and other climate refugees can be absorbed by other areas already exhibiting various ecological stresses.
One cannot help wonder just when those ensconced within their air conditioned, bottled water, energy dependent lifestyles will realize they are living in a mirage that threatens their families lives.
Fasten your seat belt, society and you are in for the ride of your life as collapsing regional ecosystems [search] and climate refugees [search] become part of life.
A 160 square mile chunk of Antarctica's Wilkens ice shelf is collapsing [ ark | more \ ark | more2 \ ark2 | search ] in the continent's fast warming southwest Antarctic Peninsula.
"Block after block of ice is just tumbling and crumbling into the ocean.. The shelf is not just cracking off and a piece goes drifting away, but totally shattering.
" Given the Connecticut sized collapsing shelf is permanent floating ice, in itself this will not lead to sea level rise [search] .
But loss of ice shelves does make it easier for land ice to melt and otherwise move into the ocean.
Along with Arctic sea and glacial ice melt, this new alarming example of accelerated ice cap melting [ ark ] presents dramatic visual evidence illustrating the advanced state of global heating.
The time for the discussions of small thinking in response to climate change and global ecological crises is long since past.
Simply, light bulbs and Priuses, biofuels and carbon trading, are not going to do it.
Only a comprehensive program of social change -- things like ending coal use and ancient forest logging, while reducing human population and consumption -- pursued through intense advocacy, awareness building and profound personal and societal revolution, will save us now.
It is relatively easy to see how burning fossil fuels causes climate change.
What is more inscrutable and often given short thrift is the extent to which the condition of terrestrial ecosystems is coupled to the atmosphere [search] .
Humanity is already using nearly half of both the energy captured by plants and the Earth's surface for agriculture.
I am certain that a full-accounting of the matter would show millenia of human caused land cover changes to be the primary component of climate change, water scarcity and the global ecological emergency.
China's over-population driven pollution frenzy [ ark ] threatens the entire planet.
Frankly, the fault extends to the already over-developed world which exported their pollution to benefit from cheap labor.
In the process a global despoiler of unprecedented magnitude has been created; which says a lot, give Europe and U.S. history of ecological imperialism [search] .
China is an environmental disaster [search] .
China is now a fourth desert and water scarce, most forests are gone so it imports illegal timber, it goes through 200 million tons of coal annually causing soaring carbon emissions [ ark ], and increasingly it brings these problems to the region and World with an insatiable appetite for resources.
And China is a brutal totalitarian dictatorship; an enemy of not only global ecological sustainability, but equally of freedom and justice.
Destroying the Earth is not a poverty alleviation program.
In China we see the end of the world as over-population and demand for cheap consumer crap overwhelms the world's faltering ecosystems.
Given the world consumes its products and is faced with a wave of Chinese pollution, China's pollution is everybody's problem.
Global ecological collapse starts in China.
Ecosystems [search] matter.
To speak of economics, energy policy or other aspect of human endeavour is totally meaningless without them.
Natural habitats and their ecosystems [search] provide not only water -- but also soil, pollinators, carbon storage and many other processes -- upon which life depends.
Loss of glaciers as a result of climate change is going to devastate river systems and their attendant watersheds and ecosystems.
We have entered a vicious cycle where ecosystems are destroyed for resources, causing climate change, which results in more ecosystem destruction and so forth.
To speak of additional resource utilization from dwindling ecosystems -- such as biofuels from trees -- is remarkably disconnected from what ecological science tells us regarding how the Earth System [search] works and threat it faces.
Ten years have been squandered in terms of addressing climate change.
Robert Watson, the former chairman of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , notes world leaders have wasted a decade [ ark ] arguing about whether climate change is occurring when they should have been formulating and implementing urgent, immediate and sufficient policy actions.
This glacial pace continues as international negotiations continue to crawl along [ ark ].
The United States has been the greatest climate obstructionist [search] , followed closely in sheer criminal neglect by China and India.
Europe's activities have largely been token, with a carbon market generating windfall profits for utilities but showing little immediate potential to actually reduce emissions [ ark ].
The U.S., China and India's citizens in particular must demand commitments to timely mandatory emission cut targets, or there is exactly zero percent chance the climate crisis will be solved.
We have run out of decades to squander.
Yet again we are warned that climate change and increasing population will cause massive starvation [ more | search ].
It is appalling how few people are aware that soil, land and even the atmosphere's waste absorption potential are finite resources.
The root cause of climate change and virtually all aspects of the global ecological crisis is too many people consuming beyond the carrying capacity of ecosystems to absorb and regenerate from their impact.
The population bomb has exploded and some 6.5 billion people now live on a planet that can probably only support well one billion or less (the population about 125 years ago).
How this grotesque overshooting of the biosphere's ecological systems is unwound will have profound impacts upon the quality, and even possibility, of continued human existence.
Will just and equitable measures be taken to reduce human numbers through population controls, as China has done somewhat successfully , or will ecological collapse do it much less mercifully?
Humanity has reached the limits of technology and the biosphere's ability to put off over-population's impact being fully felt.
Now may be a good time to buy a small piece of land and take up gardening.
China and the U.S. continue to compete for the dubious honor of being the world's worst climate and environmental national villain [search] .
As humanity careens towards self-immolation, both the Chinese totalitarian and American imperialist regimes use the international climate change and environmental negotiations to jockey for national advantage rather than uniting with the international community in common cause against the greatest planetary threat to humanity ever.
Both fail to show international visionary leadership, continuing to obstruct and send conflicting signals regarding joining an international program of mandatory emission reductions -- making the critical process of developing a post-Kyoto policy more difficult than necessary .
This week China felt it necessary to state it is not ready to join a post-Kyoto pact , as the United States floated that it is ready to contribute to world carbon emission cuts .
Check back next week.
A climate deal is beginning to look more likely post-Kyoto , the question is whether it will be adequate and equitable, or parochial and half-measured.
Certainly there is much at stake and no one expects either country to haphazardly damage their economies or development prospects, yet both are guilty of refusing to participate in good faith in solving a planetary ecological climate emergency for which they are most responsible.
An epic environmental disaster of unprecedented proportions is playing itself out in China.
Yes, Europe and the United States are historically culpable for introducing and establishing capitalism without reference to sustaining natural capital as the foundation of economic life.
Yet China has embraced resource intensive, ecosystem devastating capitalism [search] with a particular fervor.
What is happening in terms of resource use, climate impact and junk consumer product production in China (and the world's role in consuming) simply cannot be sustained.
All right thinking free peoples have a choice to be made.
Either learn to live ethically and environmentally responsibly as one of over 6 billion human inhabitants of the Earth, embracing personal virtue and sacrifice; or be part of the ecological devastation of everyday consumer living that is dismantling the Earth biosphere, and thus suffer with your children the horrific consequences of eating the Earth to death.
This environmental leader is telling you the full truth: personal sacrifice is required for the Earth, climate and humanity to survive.
Tasmania, Australia's woodchipping giant Gunns Ltd. is poised to be granted fast track approval by the Tasmanian government to build a massive chemical pulp mill in northern Tasmania.
This forest-hungry pulp mill will be a disaster for Australia's ancient forests, climate, wildlife and future.
If built, the US$1.4 billion project would need four million tonnes of logs a year.
It would double Gunns' current rate of clearcutting in Tasmania's native forests.
It will also dump thousands of tonnes of poisonous waste into Bass Strait every day, threatening marine life, tourism and the fishing industry.
For way too long Tasmania's ancient forests - some containing massive eucalyptus trees - have been clearcut to produce paper pulp, mostly for the Japanese market... Continued markets for paper pulp from ancient forest liquidation depend upon this disastrous pulp mill being forced through the Australian legal system... the impact of this massive pulp mill on Tasmania's ancient native forests, much less regional and global climate, have not been considered.
Additionally Minister Turnbull has acknowledged there is insufficient data available to assess the impacts of 64,000 tonnes a day of poisonous waste being released into Bass Strait... (the) Gunns had already signed a contract with construction firm John Holland to start building the pulp mill "in the first week of September"... At a time when Australia's federal government is proposing funding ancient forest protection and conservation internationally as a measure to a combat climate change, it is hypocritical and repulsive that Australia continues industrially clearing its own native forests.
Australia's ancient forests will still be logged, even clearcut, for throw away consumer products; even as the Australian government calls upon less developed and poor nations to protect their forests for the climate.

The rise in demand for air travel is one of the most serious environmental threats facing the Earth.
Global aviation's negative impact upon global climate and ecology [search] is becoming more evident and known.
Aviation accounts for about 2% of world emissions of carbon dioxide, over 6% in the U.K. and other over-developed countries, and projected passenger growth of five percent a year means airplane emissions are growing more rapidly than any other source.
Air transport contributes disproportionately heavily to global warming, as carbon dioxide and water vapor emitted at high altitude are four times more potent than at sea level... The " Camp for Climate Action " outside London's Heathrow airport is this week highlighting aviation's centrality to fighting global warming.
Heathrow is the world's busiest airport and a bigger source of CO2 emissions than most countries, yet the airport's capacity is to be doubled by building a third runway... The danger of "celebrity environmentalism" is clear as the launch of Leonardo DiCaprio’s eco-documentary entitled "The 11th Hour" coincides with the Heathrow aviation protests.
Mr. DiCaprio glibly defends his and other celebrity's use of private jets, and despite a solar powered house and hybrid car, all his personal efforts to reduce his carbon footprint are shattered by a jet-setting lifestyle.
Clearly addressing climate change and other global ecological crises will require shared sacrifice and a reduction in consumption by many... Let Leo know that the battle to stop the growth in aviation's greenhouse gas emission is one the most important environmental battles ever that require his personal example... Let him know you will see his movie if he swears off private jets.

Millions of farm birds could be left without enough food and breeding sites next spring if plans to scrap Europe’s agricultural land set-aside targets for next year go ahead, warn environmental groups.
Plans to set a zero set-aside targets from October this year have been announced by the EU Commissioner for Agriculture, Mariann Fischer-Boel, as a response to rising food prices.
Those plans are to be ratified by ministers this autumn.
Several studies confirm that set-asides have become a vital habitat for many of Europe’s endangered birds and insects, and that farm birds have declined by nearly 50% on average since 1980.
Over 5300 people have written to European politicians this month, asking for the plans to be dropped and supporting a moratorium on biofuel targets.
Glen Barry, Director of Ecological Internet explains: “Dramatic declines in insect, bird and wild flower populations show that many of Europe’s ecosystems are under extreme stress from intensive agriculture and climate change.
Our future depends on protecting healthy ecosystems.
We need real cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, with massive cuts in energy use as well as truly sustainable renewable energy, such as wind and solar power.
More intensively farmed monocultures cannot be part of the solution.”
A climate change protest camp [ more ] has been set up outside Heathrow airport in the UK, and thousands of protesters are expected at the " Camp for Climate Action " which will highlight the link between aviation and global warming [search] .
Current and projected growth in air travel is clearly not environmentally sustainable.
Aviation is the fastest growing source of greenhouse gas emissions in the UK.
This sort of civil disobedience is precisely what is needed now at an immense scale against airports, SUVs, coal power, the oil industry, flacid governments and numerous other Earth destroyers if climate disaster is to be averted.
Maybe the private jet carrying Leonardo DiCaprio will be blocked as he swoops in to lecture others at this 11th hour on global ecology.
The sacrifice is you.
Arctic ice cover has shrunk faster this summer than in any year since reliable satellite imagery of the polar cap became available in 1979.
A record has been set for the lowest recorded northern hemisphere sea ice area, and we still have five or six weeks of ice melt before the usual minima.
A user pointed out this graph and map showing clearly the magnitude of ice melt.
Replacement of ice with open waters leads to further warming, making it very unlikely that previous ice levels will be achieved any time soon.
Artic sea ice loss is a major indicator of abrupt, runaway climate change [search] .
As a trained ecologist it hurts so much to see these dispassionate presentations that clearly indicate global ecological collapse.
I am saddened, shocked and dismayed at humanity's continued climate change denial [search] .
How sure of cataclysmic climate change impacts must we be before we fundamentally change our way of being individually and socially?
The UN reports that the world suffered an unprecedented string of extreme weather events in early 2007, the Goracle falsely suggests carbon emissions in China can be cut without economic sacrifice , and the poor are to bear even more hunger due to climate change .
This is just today's news!
How will ecological and social collapse be averted?
What sort of actions are necessary and warranted?
Who will lead?
Who should we follow?
TAKE ACTION!
Europe's bird and insect populations, as well as heavily stressed terrestrial ecosystems, face decimation as the European Commissioner for Agriculture plans to scrap land set-asides for the 2008 season.
This unexpected move is a response to rising grain prices – caused by the growing biofuel sector and worsening climate change impacts.
Europe’s common farmland birds have declined by nearly 50% since 1980... 45% of Europe’s butterflies are at risk of extinction and a recent study found 80% declines in bee diversity and 70% declines in the diversity of wild flowers dependent on pollination on hundreds of sites in the UK and Netherlands... the future Europe's ecosystem functionality such as pollination and provisions of food supplies may be at risk as pollinators are driven into extinction.
Biofuel expansion for the European market is already causing massive deforestation, biodiversity losses, displacements of local communities and loss of food sovereignty in the global South – now Europe’s wildlife and remaining terrestrial ecosystems are likely to become another victim.
Please send the letter below to ask Europe’s politicians not to scrap land set-asides until they are substituted for a more sustainable EU agricultural policy based on organic agriculture and biodiverse mixed farming system.
Biofuel targets and incentives must be abolished now, to protect biodiversity and food supplies worldwide.
President Bush has announced he will some three days after the United Nations holds crucial climate talks in September.
Leading economic powers and carbon emitters from the industrialized and developing world [ more | more2 ] have been invited from September 27-28 to discuss reducing carbon emissions.
Golly. If the Bush administration really has had a change of heart on the need for mandatory carbon and other greenhouse gas emission reductions, it would be fantastic.
I would not hold my breathe however.
This administration has been criminally negligent in not only pulling the United States out of productively participating in international climate talks and agreements; but has sought to obstruct progress by the rest of the world as well.
Reneging on pledge to regulate carbon dioxide as a pollutant, withdrawing from Kyoto, censoring U.S. government climate scientists, gutting air pollution and other environmental laws -- this President will go down in history as being horrendously criminally negligent on environmental issues.
His only hope to prove he is genuine is to move past voluntary approaches and commit to moving the world towards equitable mandatory emissions cuts.
Anything else is continued criminally negligent climate obstruction.
It is very encouraging to see a high-profile U.S. politician -- former US Democratic presidential candidate Senator John Kerry -- proposing serious legislation to address illegal logging [search] in Asia, Africa and Latin America.
Destruction and diminishment of primary and old-growth natural forest habitats [search] is responsible for about one quarter of human caused greenhouse gas emissions [search].
There is a booming and out of control illegal logging industry preying upon these life-giving ecosystems and they must be stopped if humanity and the Earth are to have a chance.
The proposed "Combat Illegal Logging Act" is a much needed first step to stop this ecological evil.
However it is disappointing that "legal" clearing and selective first time logging of primary ancient forests is given a pass.
There is little or no difference in ecological impact between first time legal and illegal ancient forest logging.
An evolutionarily distinct, millions of year old ancient forest does not differentiate much between being industrially dismantled legally or illegally, or for that matter between being totally deforested or heavily commercially selectively logged.
In either case what was once an ancient forest is no longer, and in both cases massive carbon release happens immediately, while future ability to function as a carbon sink is diminished if not destroyed.
To certify that "legal" ancient forest dismemberment is somehow OK while illegal is not disingenuously and falsely suggests there is a sizeable difference in impacts upon climate, biodiversity and other ecosystem services.
There is not.
This is why Ecological Internet campaigns tirelessly to End Ancient Forest Logging -- even targeting for protest prime ancient forest logging apologists Greenpeace and WWF [alert] .
It is abundantly clear that even FSC certification is no guarantee of ecological sustainability or legality of ancient forest logging.
Global ecological sustainability depends critically upon maintaining large, intact, contiguous, natural, non-industrially managed ecological reserves to power the biosphere.
This is of course very politically problematic, but to survive as a species and a biologically complex Earth; finding the right policy combination of local, community based small-scale eco-forestry management [search] and strict protection with payments for avoided deforestation [search] and industrial diminishment must be actively sought.
This is not an opinion.
It is ecological fact based upon findings of ecological, global change and conservation biology sciences.
TAKE ACTION: Given the science and evident abrupt climate changes, Kyoto successor agreement must be negotiated now that includes mandatory emissions reductions for all major emitting economies
More than 1,000 government delegates are now meeting in Bonn to try to break gridlock in international climate change negotiations amid widening public concern and widely evident global warming impacts.
This is the first time government climate delegations have met since the U.N. sponsored Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued a spate of reports this year, drawing on the studies of some 2,500 scientists, which predict grim consequences of global warming if swift action is not taken.
These climate change policy-makers must be challenged to develop a strengthened Kyoto regime as soon as possible that transitions the world to low carbon societies.
Current Bonn talks are preparing for a meeting of environment ministers in Bali, Indonesia, in December.
It is essential formal negotiations are launched in Bali to widen and strengthen the U.N.'s Kyoto Protocol as soon as possible.
With the strengthened science, evident climate impacts now, and the rapidity of their advancement; negotiations must commence immediately, or at the latest in Bali in December, for a strengthened and expanded Kyoto system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
This can not wait until 2012 when the present Kyoto protocol expires.
As was done to successfully address the ozone hole under the Montreal Protocol, timetables must be advanced and mandatory participation in emission cuts expanded if the world is not to burn.

Importantly, the main conclusion is that the world has what it takes to fight climate change and that such climate mitigation policies are affordable [ more | more2 ].
This Working Group III Report "Mitigation of Climate Change" [official summary] is the third segment of a larger IPCC report.
The first concluded global warming is almost certainly human caused and the second warned of the consequences already occurring and yet to come such as massive human death and disease, droughts, floods, and storms.
The new climate mitigation [search] report proposes limiting concentrations of greenhouse gases to between 445 parts per million and (gulp!
) 650 parts per million (we are at 380 now).
China replaced the US as the primary obstructionist, fearing the lower end target would harm its booming economy, yet it appears scientific recommendations emerged largely unscathed by government representatives.
Key recommendations for stopping the rise in carbon dioxide levels include not waiting for new technologies but proceeding with the tools and policies we have now.
Available policies that it is suggested must be intensified include shifts away from coal, embracing energy efficiency, reducing deforestation, fuel taxes, strengthen Kyoto's binding emission limits , and advances in solar and other renewable technologies.
Climate Ark has been advocating these policies for years.There are concerns in the report as well -- an emphasis upon nuclear energy, biofuels and little mention of ancient forest logging.
Yet, in balance it is refreshing the report focuses upon real ways to reduce emissions now rather than pie in the sky technology for later.
Men of courage such as Prince Charles have called for a rapid response to climate change akin to fighting WWII , George Monbiot continues to show through methodical research that dramatic emission cuts are the only way forward, and lesser men such as myself have pointed out the need for serious structural changes in how society is organized to fight climate change; including population controls, carbon taxes, a ban on coal , an end to ancient rainforest logging [alert] and rapid, ambitious renewable targets , if we and the Earth are to survive.
Forget about geoengineering proposals including seeding the ocean with iron (plankton blooms = ocean dead zones), orbiting Earth mirrors to reflect radiation, and distant plans to filter and sequester carbon from coal and the atmosphere.
Doing so will lead to severe negative and chaotic follow-on effects, and distracts from the obvious - climate change is caused by greenhouse gas emissions and it will only be successfully addressed by starting to dramatically reduce these emissions now.
In addition to the Chinese and American governments, and the UN IPCC process; individuals such as Laurie David , Leonardo DiCaprio, Richard Branson and even Al Gore who sell easy, painless chimerical solutions are full of it.
Climate change and the whole raft of attendant global ecological emergencies will only be solved through extreme personal sacrifice and learned voluntary simplicity, and major societal restructuring of economics, agriculture, transport and others.
Those looking for easy answers that allow continued profligate energy consumption and living large are delaying the hard choices necessary to save being.
Cimate change incrementalists do a disservice to truth and the Earth.
The world's coal reserves hold some 3500 gigatonnes of carbon, compared to the atmosphere currently holding around 800 gigatonnes (600 gigatonnes before the industrial revolution).
Burning this coal [search] will single-handedly destroy the Earth's atmosphere.
Australia holds some 8.6% of global coal reserves, that they sell to some 35 countries Their coal industry virtually runs the Australian government.
Recently Ecological Internet launched a campaign calling upon the Australian government to leave their coal in the ground which is still active.
There has been some progress in this regard, as the New South Wales state judiciary has issued a landmark environmental judgment [ more ] in relation to coal mine approval processes - that the state government must now "take account of the greenhouse gas emissions from burning the mine's output - even though 80 per cent will be exported.
" The need to account for climate change in coal project's environmental impact statements could prove significant in keeping more of it in the ground and less in the air.
TAKE ACTION: With a decade at most to avert global warming catastrophe, let the U.S. Supreme Court know carbon dioxide is clearly a pollutant, causing climate change mayhem, and as such must be regulated by the U.S. EPA
In one of the most important environmental cases ever to come before the U.S. Supreme Court, climate change and the regulation of carbon dioxide emissions will be ruled upon by the nation's highest court for the first time.
In essence, the case will put the evidence for climate change "on trial" to determine whether the available data are enough to say that CO2 emissions pose a threat to the public's wellbeing.
The case is Massachusetts vs. EPA, 05-1120.
Essentially two questions are at issue: can the U.S. government's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulate CO2, and if it can, is it required to.
The court's decision which is expected in June 2007, with oral arguments scheduled as soon as late November or early December of this year, could hasten U.S. mitigation of greenhouse-gas emissions - or bring action to a disappointing halt.
Climate change caused extinction has commenced in earnest, yet another indication of the urgency of implementing rigorous policy now .
A review of hundreds of scientific studies has concluded that "animal and plant species have begun dying off or changing sooner than predicted because of global warming... These fast-moving adaptations come as a surprise even to biologists and ecologists because they are occurring so rapidly.
" Cold dependent species and species unable to move further north or to higher elevations are dying.
Just five years ago it was thought this would take many years to occur, but the new report indicates it is happening much more quickly than had been expected.
The sheer mass of humanity's impacts upon the Earth has lead to global heating and numerous other instances of global ecosystem collapse [search] including eroding soils [search] , water scarcity [search] , desertification [search] and forest loss and simplification [search] .
Human industrial and personal consumption activities are making the Earth uninhabitable, and humanity is just one of many animals losing their habitat and in danger of imminent extinction.
If you haven't yet, see Al Gore's movie on DVD , it makes it crystal clear.
The French government has come up with an intriguing and long overdue policy proposal of taxing countries' goods whose government has not ratified Kyoto [ more ] - namely Annex I countries Australia and the United States.
This presumably would compensate for their free rider economic behavior.
Australia has signaled they are moving closer to ratifying Kyoto in practice if not in name [ more ].
Meanwhile the Swiss are pushing the golden bullet of climate change policy - a broad based international tax on carbon emissions .
They propose that revenue be used for measures mitigating the effects of global warming.
This is very similar to Ecological Internet's own Lincoln Plan which further proposes tax increases are offset by tax reductions on employment.
UK is to tax gas guzzling SUVs .
And there is growing concensus in Nairobi that a Kyoto successor must come soone and include mandatory emission caps for all nations [ more | more2 ] while being more flexible and taking into account historical emissions levels and allowing developing nations some allowance to reduce poverty.
Clearly China is feeling the pressure to justify their policy as Chinese emissions are soaring .
According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) [search] chief scientist Rajendra K. Pachauri, their much anticipated Fourth Assessment report "will offer much stronger evidence of how man is changing Earth's climate [ more ], and should prompt balky governments into action against global warming.
" The IPCC is a global network of some 2,000 climate and other scientists that regularly assesses the state of research into how carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases produced by industry and other human activities are affecting the climate.
The Fourth Assessment is expected to be released in installments beginning next February, and "there's much stronger evidence now of human actions on the change in climate that's taken place" since the Third Assessment in 2001.
The report "will offer significantly more evidence on sea-level rise [search] , the melting of glaciers [search] and the growing scarcity of water [search] .
" The 2001 assessment projected temperatures would rise this century between 1.4 and 5.8 degrees Celsius (2.5 and 10.4 degrees Fahrenheit), depending on factors such as how quickly governments rein in emissions.
The upcoming report is expected to narrow this range as "some of the uncertainties are being reduced.
"
"Evidence emerging in the past five years or so suggests the presence of many previously unknown tipping points that could trigger dangerous climate change .
" There are indications that the speed and severity of climate change is approaching or exceeding the worst case scenarios as given in ranges of possibilities by scientists.
Throughout the years of international climate negotations worst case scientific scenarios of abrupt [search] , run-away [search] climate collapse were consistently downplayed and watered down.
Old ideas of gradual smooth change are giving way to cataclysmic shifts of state in atmospheric processes and patterns.
It was thought that Greenland and Antarctica ice sheet melting [search] would take hundreds if not thousands of years to appreciably rise sea levels, allowing plenty of time for adaptation.
Science has now become aware of crevices in the ice sheets which allow melting water to enter oceans in as little as 10 seconds!
"These flows completely change our understanding of the dynamics of ice sheet destruction.
"
The journal Nature reports "Global carbon emissions are now growing by 3.2% a year... That's four times higher than the average annual growth of 0.8% from 1990-99... We are not on any of the stabilization paths.
" [ more | more2 ] We are well beyond Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projections of the emissions levels needed to prevent damaging climate change.
International negotiations are lagging .
China currently contributes some 16% to global emissions, but accounts for 40% of the growth in world emissions.
What in the hell is going on here?
Clearly humanity as a whole must start acting soon -- it's urgent.
It's beyond urgent.
It is life threatening.
The greatest test of humanity ever.
Without immediately placing all intellectual, financial and societal resources at the disposal of those studying climate change science, developing sufficient policy responses, and those advocating for the necessary social change; the Earth is going to burn.
All countries must in earnest participate in negotiations to set mandatory carbon emission caps for each nation based upon many factors including each country's wealth, past emissions, and potential to grow uncontrollably.
We need to start yesterday, and the U.S. and Australia must end their criminal defense of fossil fuels.
At Nairobi, governments are debating the future of the Kyoto Protocol and action to prevent the most serious impacts of climate change.
So far, they appear to have ignored pleas to address one of the greatest single sources of carbon emissions : the destruction of South-east Asia's peatlands and forests.
The annual emissions from annual peat and forest fires are about five times as great as the total annual emission cuts which the Kyoto Protocol aims to make by 2012, from 1990 levels.
Indonesia alone holds 60% of all tropical peat, containing some 50 billion tonnes of carbon.
This is equivalent to 7-8 years of global fossil fuel emissions.
Timber and oil palm plantations are draining the peatlands and also pushing local communities and small-holders into peat areas and rainforests.
Once this peat is drained, all this carbon will eventually be released into the atmosphere, unless the peat is subsequently re-flooded and restored.
Annual fires, many of them set deliberately by plantation owners, speed up the process.
This year's fire season has been one of the worst on record.
Wetlands International warned earlier this week that the boom in biofuels is speeding up the destruction, and further that one tonne of palm oil grown on peat is linked to the release of around 20 tonnes of carbon dioxide released from that peat.
Due to its low cost, palm oil is set to become the prime feedstock for biodiesel.
As the international community meets this week in Nairobi, Kenya to formulate international climate policy , you can depend upon Climate Ark for extensive news coverage .
Not without criticism, Climate Ark continues to support the Kyoto process [search] as an established mechanism to reduce emissions that can be tightened and expanded, rather than restarting international negotiations from scratch.
Clearly India and China must enter the emissions caps, though just as clearly they and other developing countries should be allowed to emit more per capita then rich countries.
Climate change will be averted or minimized only by dramatic emissions reductions, rapid embrace of renewable energy, an end to ancient forest deforestation and diminishment, and an embrace of energy conservation and efficiency.
As individuals we must do what we can to achieve these goals, while leading our leaders to establish societal constraints that make living green more easy.
Meanwhile, lets hope for enlightened global governance from Nairobi.
One immediate partial climate crisis remedy whose time has come is the idea of " avoided deforestation " [ more | more2 ] whereby countries are compensated for maintaining intact ancient forest ecosystems.
This win/win/win/win/lose strategy would maintain critical global ecosystem services, preserve biodiversity and genetic resources, keep existing carbon locked into terrestrial ecosystems, and provide a major source of sustainable development income to forest dwellers.
It is only the timber merchants of death that lose, and given their poorly shared benefits from years of ancient forest ecosystem liquidation, frankly they do not count.
They will be lucky to get out of the business of forest ecocide alive and not be strung from the few remaining trees for their ecological crimes against humanity.
Industrialized nations' emissions of greenhouse gases edged up to the highest level in more than a decade in 2004 despite curbs such as Kyoto meant to fight global warming.
Emissions from 40 industrial nations climbed 1.6 percent since 2003 overall to 17.8 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide -- mainly from power plants, factories and cars.
It was always known Kyoto's tepid targets were clearly inadequate to achieve the 60-75% reductions in greenhouse gas emissions necessary to maintain a stable climate.
The political system and entwined oil interests are simply not up to the challenge of decarbonizing the global economy.
Increasingly other smaller political units, businesses and even individuals and small groups protesting are taking up climate leadership.
In the UK protestors are now trying to shut down Europe's largest coal power station [ more | more2 ].
If the world's coal is burned the atmosphere is over.
California will be the first U.S. state to cap greenhouse gas emissions , including those from industrial plants, under a landmark deal reached Wednesday by Gov.
Arnold Schwarzenegger and legislative Democrats [ more | more2 ].
The bill is designed to cut California's emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases 25% by 2020.
"The bill would require the state's major industries _ such as utility plants, oil and gas refineries, and cement kilns _ to reduce their emissions of the pollutants widely believed to contribute to global warming.
The key mechanism driving the reductions would be a market program allowing businesses to buy, sell and trade emission credits with other companies.
"
It ends up that some replacement coolants for ozone in air conditioners mandated under the Montreal Protocol to address the ozone layer hole are in fact greenhouse gases themselves and contribute to global warming:
"When more than two dozen countries undertook in 1989 to fix the ozone hole over Antarctica, they began replacing chloroflourocarbons in refrigerators, air conditioners and hair spray.
But they had little idea that using other gases that contain chlorine or fluorine instead also would contribute greatly to global warming.
"
There has also been some reasonably good news in recent weeks that latest measurements indicate the ozone hole will repair itself though taking somewhat longer than previously expected.
Human caused global heating is profoundly a matter of justice and equity (and of course survival).
The Chicago Tribune reports on rising seas inundating the island of Malasiga in Papua New Guinea (a country near and dear to my heart as I lived there for many years).
Despite there not being a "power line or factory or air conditioner within a day's walk of this village of 400 people" this and other PNG islands and coastal lands are being swamped as salt water inundates villages and farms.
It is the poor and/or indigenous peoples by necessity living more closely with nature - including the more publicized plight of Tuvalu's [search] battle with rising seas - that will suffer most from the fossil fuel intensive consumptive and polluting lifestyles of the overdeveloped rich countries.
Many are making the case that displaced residents of New Orleans are the first modern large scale climate change refugees [ more ].
States in the U.S. and Australia are developing carbon trading systems to curb greenhouse gases after the federal governments in both countries refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol.
In Australia starting in 2010 electricity companies in all eight states and territories would have to hold tradable permits to emit greenhouse gases.
In the U.S., New York and six other northeastern U.S. states agreed on a plan to begin in 2009 to cut carbon dioxide emissions from power plants by 10 percent over 10 years - and California is moving forward with plans to cap and trade greenhouse gases .
Timely changes of national government in both countries and their eventual rejoining of the Kyoto process should allow convergence into a single international carbon market whose emission targets can be regularly tightened.
In recent weeks the United States has witnessed more and intensified wildlires [news search] , heatwaves [news search] and droughts [news search] that have been exacerbated by climate change.
Time to add another to the list of evident climate change impacts that are occurring right now as the recurrent Pacific ocean "dead zone" off the Oregon coast has returned and is worse than ever.
At 70 miles long it is smaller than say the Gulf Coast dead zone [search] , yet massive crab and fish die offs are occurring.
The causation of these oxygen deprived ocean dead zones [search] is complex and not fully understood.
In Oregon unusual weather patterns and warmer oceans caused by climate change appear preeminent.
A new study finds Greenland's ice sheet is now melting three times faster today than it was five years ago [ more ].
If the ice cap were to completely melt global sea levels would rise by 6.5m (21 feet).
These findings yet further strengthen the conclusions of the scientific consensus that global warming is real, has become evident in recent years, and indicate that melting polar ice sheets are pushing sea levels higher.
China's economic surge and profligate use of polluting energy sources threatens planetary climatic sustainability.
Americans enjoy a standard of living based upon wasteful energy use that is not universalizable.
What then is to be done?
Should China and other economies in transition, to say nothing of the billions in abject poverty outside of the energy grid, be left to burn wood and dung?
Is American gluttonous energy consumption a birthright based upon their higher moral character and manifest destiny?
Is it too much to expect that the rich give up some of their wealth - or more precisely, access to energy - so the poor can survive?
Americans are manifestly slovenly and greedy - they would just as soon kill peasants to drive their SUVs, rather than drive a sensible vehicle.
Below Nature magazine takes a more scholarly, measured approach to the same intractable problem.
Increasing numbers of the World's citizenry are aware of the dangers posed by climate change.
Increasingly erratic and dangerously extreme weather will impact most of us - perhaps only excluding the super rich - in a myriad of ways; ranging from agricultural decline, to flooding, to deadly heat waves.
Unfortunately, those with the power in leadership roles that could most do something about climate change are the least inclined to do so.
Perhaps the G8 protests - mostly in regards to African poverty, but also climate change - can wake them up.
Alarm bells will ring out during the Group of Eight (G8) summit next month to wake up world leaders to take action against climate change.
The environment group Friends of the Earth International has issued a call for people to ring bells at 13.45 hours (local time) on July 7 at the summit venue in Gleneagles, Scotland, and around the world "to wake the G8 leaders up to the fact that time is running out to tackle climate injustice.
"
The good news is that climate change has the attention of the U.S. Senate. The bad news is they are still unwilling to provide leadership necessary to begin mandatory emissions cuts, as the McCain-Lieberman climate bill was voted down.
This occurred despite the Senate passing a resolution noting that the U.S. must eventually enact mandatory limits on global warming pollution.
But as Senator John McCain stated - the climate change issue will be back, scientific findings will continue to accumulate, as will accounts of its impacts.
Shame of those Senators that put off necessary policy, increasing the risks to humankind from massive and perhaps abrupt climate shifts.
The debate over global warming gathered steam in the Senate this week.
As part of a broad energy bill, members began considering several amendments aimed at cutting carbon dioxide emissions and other heat-trapping gases blamed for global warming.
In a World of spiraling climate change, timid responses that represent the lowest common denominator between oil beholden Senate millionaires, is not going to cut it.
True American leadership is needed to cap carbon dioxide emissions.
Even a modest cap would set an important precedent, establish carbon trading mechanisms, and begin processes that must continue far into the future if climate is to be stabilized.
Best estimates are that emissions need to be reduced 50% as soon as possible - this journey must begin now, even if baby steps.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An ambitious bipartisan plan to slow U.S. greenhouse gases with an emissions trading program collapsed in the Senate on Tuesday after a key Republican threw his support behind a weaker, voluntary plan.
The Senate approved, 66-to-29, a plan by Nebraska Republican Chuck Hagel to offer generous tax breaks to U.S. utilities, refiners and manufacturing plants that develop technology to limit emissions of carbon dioxide.
It would not cap U.S. emissions of carbon, which are linked to the global warming blamed for melting polar ice caps and rising oceans.
Essentially all energy on the Earth can ultimately be traced to the sun.
Our whole biosphere has evolved as an ultra-efficient means to transform solar rays into chemical energy required for life.
In our quest for renewable energy, we would be well served to mimic natural ecosystems.
Solar arrays coupled with fuel cells for energy storage may be the holy grail upon which advanced human societies depend.
Humanity would be well served to invest mightily in their continued development.
The price of a watt of solar energy has fallen from $100 to $8 in the past three decades.
It is time to get serious about solar energy as a means of averting environmental collapse.
Expectations are high as the G8 meeting of industrial nations is set to engage on climate change next month.
Against the backdrop of a sizzling Planet showing signs of spiraling ecological collapse, the stakes could hardly be higher.
Tony Blair desperately seeks a legacy, providing international climate change leadership such as it is; George Bush is as beholden to oil as ever, criminally obstructing international climate policy; the senior science academies of the G8 nations saying human caused climate change is happening now, compelling their leaders to take action; and global and American public opinion increasingly crystallizing, demanding climate change leadership.
Yet reports are that the White House is making extraordinary efforts to scupper Britain's attempts to tackle global warming during the G8 summit.
The G8 meeting will be deemed a failure if it achieves anything less than an admission that humans are causing climate change, binding targets for reducing emissions, and substantial financial support for energy efficiency and renewable energy.
Eventual climate stabilization is dependent upon even relatively small policy shifts as soon as possible.
Failure of all industrial countries â€“ including the U.S., China and India â€“ to immediately take concrete and coordinated international climate action will doom the Earth and all her inhabitants to murderous ecological collapse.
Most of all, shame on President Bush for his stubborn intransigence that threatens us all â€“ particularly our children.
ClimateArk < http://www.climateark.org/ > intends to intensively track full-news coverage of the G8 proceedings at http://www.climateark.org/news/ , and will be launching a major action alert calling for G8 climate leadership just prior to the meeting's commencement.
Finally a conservative commentator that understands that conservation is deeply and profoundly conservative.
Thomas L. Friedman of the New York Times is guilty of profoundly deep and free thinking on the nature of America's oil dependency.
He has been writing regularly about a "geo-green" alliance of environmentalists and conservatives, concerned with the national security, climate change and other impacts of oil dependency.
There is tremendous hope in following his lines of thinking.
We are witnessing a major shift in public opinion, as global warming has broken through the public's psyche.
It is now widely accepted in even the United States that climate change threatens the well-being of the Planet and all its life.
In recent weeks we have seen major outpouring of concern from business, leading scientific academies and even conservative politicians.
The Senate is considering mandatory emissions reductions in their energy bill deliberations, and Prime Minister Blair of the UK is working hard to make climate change policy advances at the coming G8 summit.
The extent to which the Bush administration lags on climate change leadership was embarrassingly apparent, as it was revealed that a Bush administration official had been inappropriately editing governmental climate reports.
Thankfully, the attention is finally shifting from whether climate change is happening to what can be done.
As California's governor put it, "We know the science, we see the threat, and we know the time for action is now.
" There are no alternatives to dramatically and swiftly reducing emissions through energy efficiency and renewable energy development.
More on these matters can be found in this New York Times' editorial .
Global ecological sustainability depends upon swiftly addressing climate changes -- and other symptoms of too many people and too polluting industry destroying life-giving ecosystems.
ClimateArk , a project of Ecological Internet , is pleased to announce the launch of a new email list entitled "Climate Change News Today".
The format will closely parallel Forests.org's " Forest Conservation News Today ", providing commentary and full-text news coverage from a variety of sources of major developments in climate change policy, science and advocacy -- highlighting about one major development a week.
Full climate writings and links to news can be found at http://www.climateark.org/blog/ -- the best and most important of which will be sent to this new list.

We are witnessing a major sea-change as global warming has broken through the public's psyche and is now widely and rightly judged to threaten the well-being of the Planet and all its life.
In recent weeks we have seen major outpouring of concern from business, conservative politicians and other interests beholden to the fossil fuel lobby and hostile to climate change science.
The attention has rightly turned to what to do, rather than questioning whether climate change is happening.
Global ecological sustainability depends upon swiftly addressing climate changes -- and other symptoms of too many people and too polluting industry destroying life-giving ecosystems.
Don't look now, but the ground has shifted on global warming.
After decades of debate over whether the planet is heating and, if so, whose fault it is, divergent groups are joining hands with little fanfare to deal with a problem they say people can no longer avoid.
First it was the National Academies of Science from around the World, now it is big business - all demanding the World's leaders actually lead on climate change.
Look for an alert from Ecological Internet targeting the G8 powers soon.
The American government at the behest of President Bush and his ruling oil oligarchy are willfully and criminally obstructing climate science and policy - placing in serious jeopardy the Earth's environment.
This comes as another slew of scientists have urged the American government to act swiftly to address climate change as a matter of environmental urgency.
Mr. Bush has the gall to say that climate change is serious while not only doing nothing in response, but also actively impeding other countries.
America's criminal leadership must be stopped and made to pay for their crimes.
A White House official who once led the oil industry's fight against limits on greenhouse gases has repeatedly edited government climate reports in ways that play down links between such emissions and global warming, according to internal documents.
In handwritten notes on drafts of several reports issued in 2002 and 2003, the official, Philip A. Cooney, removed or adjusted descriptions of climate research that government scientists and their supervisors, including some senior Bush administration officials, had already approved.
...an unlikely alliance of neoconservatives, farmers and union and environmental leaders who want to wean the U.S. of its oil habit--some for purely green reasons (to stave off global warming), but others for the sake of cutting U.S. dependence on the volatile Middle East.
And they have some radical ideas about how to do it.
It is the responsibility of every human being to do what they can to address climate change and other environmental crises.
In the absence of American Presidential leadership, no less than Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger of California has stepped up to take the mantle of leadership.
This first step is to be heartily congratulated.
We must envision policies adequate to address climate change on the 10, 100 and 1000 year scales.
The recent tragic Asian Tsunami is indicative of the types of problems that global warming and other global ecological changes can and will exacerbate.
There is no doubt that higher sea levels would contribute to greater damage from such a wave.
In addition there are other contributions made by poor enviromental management : destruction of corals, overpopulation (particularly along coastlines ) and mangrove destruction all diminished natural resilience to such disasters.
Unfortunately, this tidal wave's aftermath is indicative of ecological collapse on a planetary scale.
The tidal waves that swept across the Indian Ocean did more than take a heavy toll of lives and property in the Maldives _ it confronted the tiny island nation with a threat to its survival.
The archipelago of 1,190 low-lying coral islands, dotted across hundreds of kilometers (miles) of ocean, has for years begged bigger, more powerful nations for action against global warming, fearing higher sea levels could literally make much of its territory disappear.
Climate skeptics are not only wrong, they are dangerous.
As oil and coal industry patsies, they are willing to lie for money, at the expense of our children's and Earth's future.
Global citizenry must get on with the task of living within the Earth's means, including ending the habit of treating the atmosphere as a waste dump.
Creation, and our continued being, depends upon it.
Many people have the impression that there is significant scientific disagreement about global climate change.
It's time to lay that misapprehension to rest.
There is a scientific consensus on the fact that Earth's climate is heating up and human activities are part of the reason.
We need to stop repeating nonsense about the uncertainty of global warming and start talking seriously about the right approach to address it.
Who would have thought that President Bush could be even more isolated on climate change policy?
Now even Saudia Arabia and Australia have distanced themselves from his regressive and dangerous allegiance to profligate energy use and climate crisis inaction.
America will come around to doing the right thing; making major investments in, and transitioning to, renewable energy while cutting emissions drastically.
The only questions are when, will it be in time, and will Mr. Bush be a hero or villian in this regard?
Indeed, enough is enough .
This intransigent, obstinate man must be encouraged to make a dramatic break with his past and lead on climate change.
Saudi Arabia announced that it had approved the Kyoto Protocol, the treaty on climate change which President Bush has been trying to kill.
And Australia, while still rejecting it, parted company from the United States by saying that it was prepared to negotiate its successor.
Coal (and of course oil) will be the death of the Planet.
There is no such things as clean coal - you can not use it without emitting carbon dioxide.
If all the coal in the world gets burned the climate will collapse.
The official treaty to curb greenhouse-gas emissions hasn't gone into effect yet and already three countries are planning to build nearly 850 new coal-fired plants, which would pump up to five times as much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere as the Kyoto Protocol aims to reduce...
By 2012, the plants in three key countries - China, India, and the United States - are expected to emit as much as an extra 2.7 billion tons of carbon dioxide, according to a Monitor analysis of power-plant construction data.
In contrast, Kyoto countries by that year are supposed to have cut their CO2 emissions by some 483 million tons.
The following editorial from the Boulder Daily Camera identifies a hallmark of Bush administration, a predilection to not only set "the world's agenda; (but) it also stifles dissenting views".
Whenever a government takes it upon themselves to stifle dissent, it is scary and dangerous.
But to do so on Climate Change - something that threatens all nations with annihilation, and is well documented scientifically - is callous, reckless and self-serving.
UNEP has announced a new climate change news tracking site called ClimateWire.org , which they describe as "the world's first daily updated, multi-sectoral and international news service specifically focussing on the issue of climate change.
" Wow - it is almost as if ClimateArk's six years of providing news tracking services - and its tens of millions of users - do not exist.
Why would UNEP feel the need to duplicate services that other conservation interests have been providing on the web for many, many years?
And at great personal expense and effort.
Another example of big conservation interests spending lots of money putting small grassroots conservation operators, who are more capable and cost effective, at a disadvantage.
This said - our site is way better than theirs, and will remain that way.
I am incredulous regarding the news item linked below, which informs us that Kyoto will "damage" Asia.
They speak of these country's economies as if they were completely independent from regional ecosystems including climatic patterns.
There will be NO economy if ecosystems collapse.
This is the fundamental flaw of the growth machine mentality that threatens global ecological sustainability and a collapse of both ecosystems and economies.
The fastest growing economies in the world would be damaged if they adopted Kyoto Protocol targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions, according to a report by the Australian Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Study Centre.
The report found East Asia was heavily dependent on power for development and strategies to relieve poverty.
It said if those economies were required to cut emissions in the manner mandated for industrialised economies under the Kyoto Protocol their economic growth strategies would be jeopardised.
Perhaps, just perhaps, President Bush is the leader whose legacy will be to have begun to address climate change in an adequate and significant fashion.
It will either be this, or a legacy of having solidified trends that will ultimately destroy the Earth's atmosphere and the Earth itself.
Can the Texas oil man lead on climate?
We shall see.
I am deeply ashamed that my country, should international efforts to address climate change prove to be inadequate, will go down in history as the empire that killed the Earth and civilization.
Shame on the United States.
The United States showed no signs of budging in its opposition to the Kyoto protocol Monday as U.N. climate change talks began, a month after President Bush's reelection and Russia's ratification of the agreement.
The U.S. government said it had "chosen a different path" from Kyoto, but vowed to work against global warming by slowing greenhouse gas emissions, investing in climate science and technology and cooperating internationally.
The life of a climate skeptic just keeps on getting harder and harder.
There is tremendous scientific consensus that climate is warming at least partially due to human emissions.
Hack scientists paid by the fossil fuel industry no longer have a scientific leg to stand on, and are being shown to be industry patsies.
Global warming skeptics for some time have been using as a scientific linchpin data that suggest temperatures in the lower atmosphere are rising more slowly than those at the surface... For warming skeptics, however, the tropospheric data are the climate science World Series.
They meet every challenge to the data with a furious counterassault, but the latest such challenge puts the skeptics down three games to one.
What do you do when your industry and the government you control is found to be changing the climate, threatening the existence of humanity and the Earth?
Well first you fight to discredit the overwhelming science that shows your culpability.
And then as this obstruction starts yielding diminishing returns, you indicate it is too late to do anything anyway.
So you treacherously change course, saying now we simply must learn to adapt to changing climate.
This is not to suggest that adaptation will not be neccessary and is unimportant, but with the full extent of climate change yet unclear, it is morally wrong if not evil to not work concurrently to reduce emissions, increase efficiency, and transition to renewable energy resources.
And even worse to turn your back on international accords you once brokered.
U.S. climate experts are preparing for a United Nations conference on global climate change, set to begin Monday in Buenos Aires, Argentina... Mr. Watson told reporters that the United States is eager to discuss adaptation.
Adaptation measures would include helping countries develop plans for coastal management, water resources and agriculture, in order to adjust to the impact of climate change.
A few weeks ago, the journal Nature carried the results of a study that pointed to a hitherto unsuspected link between the global climate and plankton.
The researchers found that the tiny ocean-going organisms release vast quantities of organic material that floats up into the air and seeds the formation of clouds.
This, in turn, affects the amount of sunlight bounced back into space - and the surface temperature of the Earth.
How the "plankton effect" might influence the debate on global warming is unclear; the effect has yet to be included in any of the supercomputer models used to predict the Earth's climate.
However, it is becoming hard to dismiss the view that life does not merely exist on the planet but actively modifies it to suit itself.
A new study finds that global warming doubles the chance of fatal heat waves.
We are way past the point where there is any doubt regarding climate change being caused by humans, and that there will be very serious impacts of these changes.
To state otherwise is criminally negligent.
Has there ever been a more self-absorbed, malevolent and dangerous society than the United States?
Despite living better than any society in history (and perhaps because of this), their current leadership refuses to address climate change.
This has stymied the action of the rest of the international community that bear the costs but not the benefits of profligate energy use.
Shame on the U.S.
Context - In the last few years, scientific research and knowledge on climate change have progressed substantially, confirming that the current warming of the Earth's climate is very likely to be due to human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels.
The Earth’s warming is already having measurable consequences and future impacts are expected to be wide-ranging and costly.
How can we adapt to those changes?
Is it possible to limit the extent of climate change and its impacts through mitigation efforts?
In 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has provided new answers in its up-to-date assessment of the current state of knowledge on climate change, summarised below.
The Earth’s climate is influenced by many factors, mainly by the amount of energy coming from the sun, but also by factors such as the amount of greenhouse gases and aerosols in the atmosphere , and the properties of the Earth’s surface, which determine how much of this solar energy is retained or reflected back to space.
O) have significantly increased since the beginning of the industrial revolution.
This is mainly due to human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels , land use change, and agriculture.
For instance, the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide is now far higher than in the last 650 000 years and has been growing faster in the last ten years than it has been since the beginning of continuous measurements around 1960.
It is very likely that, overall, human activities since 1750 have had a global warming effect on the Earth.

2.1 The warming of global climate is now unequivocal.
There are many observations of increasing air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice, and rising sea levels.
More specifically, eleven of the last twelve years (1995-2006) rank among the 12 warmest years ever recorded since global surface temperatures are measured (1850).
Over the last 100 years (1906–2005), global temperature has increased by 0.74°C.
Global sea level has risen by 17 cm during the 20th century, in part because of the melting of snow and ice from many mountains and in the polar regions.
More regional changes have also been observed, including changes in Arctic temperatures and ice, ocean salinity , wind patterns, droughts, precipitations, frequency of heat waves and intensity of tropical cyclones.
More...
2.2 The temperatures of the last half century are unusual in comparison with those of at least the previous 1300 years.
The last time that the polar regions remained significantly warmer than now for a very extended period (125 000 years ago), the sea level rose by 4 to 6 meters.

How is the climate going to change in the future?
3.1 The global average temperature is expected to increase by about 0.2°C per decade over the next two decades.
Continuing greenhouse gas emissions at or above current rates would cause a further increase in global temperatures and many other climatic changes during the 21st century.
3.2 Global average sea level is expected to rise by 18 to 59 cm by the end of the 21st century.
Warming is expected to be greatest over land and at high northern latitudes and smallest over the Southern Ocean and parts of the North Atlantic Ocean.
Other projected changes include acidification of the oceans, reduced snow cover and sea ice , more frequent heat waves and heavy precipitation, more intense tropical cyclones, and slower oceanic currents.
More...
3.3 Warming and sea level rise caused by human activities will continue for centuries, even if greenhouse gas concentrations were to be stabilized.
If warming persists over many centuries, it could lead to a complete melting of the Greenland Ice sheet , increasing global sea levels by about 7m.

Regional climate change is already affecting many natural systems.
For instance, it is increasingly being observed that snow and ice are melting and frozen ground is thawing, hydrological and biological systems are changing and in some cases being disrupted, migrations are starting earlier, and species ' geographic ranges are shifting towards the poles.
Despite remaining gaps in knowledge, it is likely that these effects are linked to human influence on climate.
At the regional level, however, responses to natural variability are difficult to separate from the effects of climate change .
Some previously unanticipated impacts of regional climate change are just starting to become apparent.
For instance, melting glaciers can threaten mountain settlements and water resources, and damage associated with coastal flooding are increasing.
More...
5.1 Over the course of the 21st century, many impacts are expected to occur in natural systems.
For instance, changes in precipitation and the melting of ice and snow are expected to increase flood risks in some areas while causing droughts in others.
If there is significant warming the capacity of ecosystems to adapt will be exceeded, with negative consequences such as an increased risk of extinction of species .
More...
5.2 The most vulnerable people are in general the poor, since they have less capacity to adapt , and their livelihoods are often dependent on resources that are linked to climate.
More...
5.3 Africa is found to be particularly vulnerable to climate change , because of existing pressures on its ecosystems and its low capacity to adapt .
On all continents, water supply and the threat to coastal areas will be an issue.
Overall future impacts are expected to be negative, although some positive effects are also expected initially, such as an increase in agricultural productivity at high latitudes accompanying a moderate warming, or decreased heating needs in cold regions.
More...
5.4 Impacts will depend on the magnitude of the temperature increase.
For instance, some crops at mid- to high latitudes will have higher productivity if local temperature increases by 1-3 °C, but will be negatively affected beyond that ( see Table ).
If higher temperatures persist after the 21st century it could result in very large impacts.
For instance, the large sea-level rise that would result from the melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets would have major repercussions on coastal areas.
The cost associated with the effects of climate change is projected to increase over time with rising temperatures.
More...
5.5 A projected increase in the severity and frequency of droughts, heat waves, and other extreme weather events is expected to cause major impacts over the course of this century ( see Table ).
More...
6.1 Humans need to adapt to the impacts of climate change , for instance through technological solutions such as coastal defences and changes in consumption habits.
Humans are already adapting to climate change, and further adaptation efforts will be necessary during coming decades.
However, adaptation alone is not expected to be able to cope will all projected effects since the options diminish and the costs increase with rising temperatures.
More...
6.2 Vulnerability of human populations to climate change and its consequences can be affected by other factors, such as pollution, conflicts, or epidemics such as AIDS.
An emphasis on sustainable development can help human societies reduce their vulnerability to climate change.
However, climate change itself can become an impediment to their development.
More...
Without additional measures to mitigate climate change , global green house gas emissions will continue to grow over the coming decades and beyond.
Most of this increase would come from developing countries, where per capita emissions are still considerably lower than those in developed countries.

8.1 Mitigation measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions have a certain cost.
However, they also constitute an economic benefit by reducing the impacts of climate change , and the costs associated with them.
In addition, they can bring economic benefits by reducing local air pollution and energy resource depletion.
If the benefits of avoided climate change are taken into account and a “carbon price” is established for each unit of greenhouse gas emissions, this could create incentives for producers and consumers to significantly invest in products, technologies and processes which emit less greenhouse gases .
The resulting mitigation potential is substantial and could offset the projected growth of global emissions over the coming decades or reduce emissions below current levels.
Mitigation measures could contribute to stabilizing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by 2100 or later.
To achieve low stabilization levels, stringent mitigation efforts are needed in the coming decades.
This could reduce global GDP by up to a few percent.
More...
8.2 Changes in lifestyle and behaviours that favor resource conservation can contribute to climate change mitigation.
More...
8.3 Mitigation measures can also have other benefits for society, such as health cost savings resulting from reduced air pollution.
However, mitigation in one country or group of countries could lead to higher emissions elsewhere or effects on the global economy.
More...
8.4 No one sector or technology can address the entire mitigation challenge.
All sectors including buildings, industry, energy production , agriculture, transport, forestry, and waste management could contribute to the overall mitigation efforts, for instance through greater energy efficiency.
Many technologies and processes which emit less greenhouse gases are already commercially available or will be in the coming decades.
More...
8.5 In order to stabilize the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere , emissions would have to stop increasing and then decline.
The lower the stabilization level aimed for, the more quickly this decline would need to occur.
World-wide investments in mitigation technologies, as well as research into new energy sources, will be necessary to achieve stabilization.
Delaying emission reduction measures limits the opportunities to achieve low stabilization levels and increases the risk of severe climate change impacts.
More...
9.1 A wide variety of policy tools can be applied by governments to create incentives for mitigation action, such as regulation, taxation, tradable permit schemes, subsidies , and voluntary agreements.
Past experience shows that there are advantages and drawbacks for any given policy instrument.
For instance, while regulations and standards can provide some certainty about emission levels, they may not encourage innovations and more advanced technologies.
Taxes and charges, however, can provide incentives, but cannot guarantee a particular level of emissions.
It is important to consider the environmental impacts of policies and instruments, their cost effectiveness, institutional feasibility and how costs and benefits are distributed.
Although the impact of the Kyoto protocol’s first commitment period 2008-2012 on global carbon emissions is expected to be limited, it has allowed the establishment of a global response to the climate problem as well as the creation of an international carbon market and other mechanisms that may provide the foundation for future mitigation efforts.
More...
9.2 Switching to more sustainable development paths can make a major contribution to climate change mitigation.
Policies that contribute to both climate change mitigation and sustainable development include those related to energy efficiency, renewable energies, and conservation of natural habitats.
In general, sustainable development can increase the capacity for adaptation and mitigation, and reduce vulnerability to the impacts of climate change.

Climate change already has a measurable impact on many natural and human systems.
Effects are projected to increase in the future and to be more severe with greater increases in temperature.
Adaptation measures are already being implemented, and will be essential in order to address the projected consequences.
There is, however, a limit to adaptation; mitigation measures will also be needed in order to reduce the severity of impacts.
Mitigation measures that aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions can help avoid, reduce or delay many impacts of climate change .
Policy instruments could create incentives for producers and consumers to significantly invest in products, technologies and processes which emit less greenhouse gases .
Without new mitigation policies, global greenhouse gas emissions will continue to grow over the coming decades and beyond.
Rapid world-wide investments and deployment of mitigation technologies, as well as research into new energy sources will be necessary to achieve a stabilization of the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere .
Additional research addressing gaps in knowledge would further reduce uncertainties and thus facilitate decision-making related to climate change .

Climate change is no longer a problem to be faced in the future.
All scientists agree that global warming is a reality that is seriously affecting the Earth already.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change states there is a "very high confidence" that humans have played a major role in climate change since 1750 by overloading the atmosphere with carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
The fact sheets on this site provide information on climate change and global warming, their likely causes and the probable effects they will have on us, our children and their children.
Tips and strategies are provided for more sustainable lifestyles that reduce our impact on climate change and global warming.
Climate change is one of many environmental issues that will increasingly affect our future.
This site also examines our finite Earth.
Many of the Earth's resources are non-renewable, or our demand is overwhelming the ability of various resources to renew themselves.
Debate, information and strategies are provided for more sustainable living within the boundaries of a finite Earth.
Global warming is the observed increase in the average temperature of the Earth's atmosphere and oceans in recent decades.
The Earth's average near-surface atmospheric temperature rose 0.6 ± 0.2 °Celsius (1.1 ± 0.4 °Fahrenheit) in the 20th century.
The current scientific consensus is that "most of the observed warming over the last 50 years is likely to have been attributable to human activities".The main cause of the human-induced component of warming is the increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs), especially carbon dioxide (CO2), due to activities such as burning of fossil fuels, land clearing, and agriculture.
Greenhouse gases are gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect.
This effect was first described by Joseph Fourier in 1824, and was first investigated quantitatively in 1896 by the Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius.
Climate sensitivity is a measure of the equilibrium response to increased GHGs, and other anthropogenic and natural climate forcings.
It is found by observational and model studies.
This sensitivity is usually expressed in terms of the temperature response expected from a doubling of CO2 in the atmosphere, which, according to the 2001 IPCC report, is estimated to be between 1.5 and 4.5 °C (2.7–8.1 °F) (with a statistical likelihood of 66-90%).
This should not be confused with the expected temperature change by a given date, which also includes a dependence on the future GHG emissions and a delayed response due to thermal lag, principally from the oceans.
Models referenced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), using a range of SRES scenarios, project that global temperatures will increase between 1.4 and 5.8 °C (2.5 to 10.5 °F) between 1990 and 2100.
An increase in global temperatures can in turn cause other changes, including a rising sea level and changes in the amount and pattern of precipitation.
These changes may increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as floods, droughts, heat waves, hurricanes, and tornados.
Other consequences include higher or lower agricultural yields, glacial retreat, reduced summer stream flows, species extinctions and increases in the ranges of disease vectors.
Warming is expected to affect the number and magnitude of these events; however, it is difficult to connect particular events to global warming.
Although most studies focus on the period up to 2100, warming (and sea level rise due to thermal expansion) is expected to continue past then, since CO2 has an estimated atmospheric lifetime of 50 to 200 years.
Only a small minority of climate scientists disagree that humanity's actions have played a major role in recent warming.
However, the uncertainty is more significant regarding how much climate change should be expected in the future, and there is a hotly contested political and public debate over implementation of policies that deal with predicted consequences, what, if anything, should be done to reduce or reverse future warming, and how to deal with the predicted consequences.
The term "global warming" is a specific case of the more general term "climate change" (which can also refer to "global cooling," such as occurs during ice ages).
In principle, "global warming" is neutral as to the causes, but in common usage, "global warming" generally implies a human influence.
However, the UNFCCC uses "climate change" for human-caused change, and "climate variability" for other changes.
Some organizations use the term "anthropogenic climate change" for human-induced changes.
Also, "global warming" may refer to both the observed and the predicted warming.
Two millennia of mean surface temperatures according to different reconstructions, each smoothed on a decadal scale.
The unsmoothed, annual value for 2004 is also plotted for reference.Relative to the period 1860–1900, global temperatures on both land and sea have increased by 0.75 °C (1.4 °F), according to the instrumental temperature record.
Since 1979, land temperatures have increased about twice as fast as ocean temperatures (0.25 °C/decade against 0.13 °C/decade (Smith, 2005).
Temperatures in the lower troposphere have increased between 0.12 and 0.22 °C per decade since 1979, according to satellite temperature measurements.
Over the one or two thousand years before 1850, world temperature is believed to have been relatively stable, with possibly regional fluctuations such as the Medieval Warm Period or the Little Ice Age.
Based on estimates by NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, 2005 was the warmest year since reliable, widespread instrumental measurements became available in the late 1800s, exceeding the previous record set in 1998 by a few hundredths of a degree Celsius.
Similar estimates prepared by the World Meteorological Organization and the UK Climatic Research Unit concluded that 2005 was still only the second warmest year, behind 1998.
Depending on the time frame, a number of temperature records are available.
These are based on different data sets, with different degrees of precision and reliability.
An approximately global instrumental temperature record begins in about 1860; contamination from the urban heat island effect is believed to be small and well controlled for.
A longer-term perspective is available from various proxy records for recent millennia; see temperature record of the past 1000 years for a discussion of these records and their differences.
The attribution of recent climate change is clearest for the most recent period of the last 50 years, for which the most detailed data are available.
Satellite temperature measurements of the tropospheric temperature date from 1979.
Carbon dioxide during the last 400,000 years and the rapid rise since the Industrial Revolution; changes in the Earth's orbit around the Sun, known as Milankovitch cycles, are believed to be the pacemaker of the 100,000 year ice age cycle.The climate system varies both through natural, "internal" processes as well as in response to variations in external "forcing" from both human and non-human causes, including solar activity, volcanic emissions, and greenhouse gases.
Climatologists agree that the earth has warmed recently.
The detailed causes of this change remain an active field of research, but the scientific consensus identifies greenhouse gases as the primary cause of the recent warming.
Outside of the scientific community, however, this conclusion can be controversial.
Adding carbon dioxide (CO2) or methane (CH4) to Earth's atmosphere, with no other changes, will make the planet's surface warmer; greenhouse gases create a natural greenhouse effect without which temperatures on Earth would be an estimated 30 °C (54 °F) lower, and the Earth uninhabitable.
It is therefore not correct to say that there is a debate between those who "believe in" and "oppose" the theory that adding carbon dioxide or methane to the Earth's atmosphere will, absent any mitigating actions or effects, result in warmer surface temperatures on Earth.
Rather, the debate is about what the net effect of the addition of carbon dioxide and methane will be, when allowing for compounding or mitigating factors.
One example of an important feedback process is ice-albedo feedback.
The increased CO2 in the atmosphere warms the Earth's surface and leads to melting of ice near the poles.
As the ice melts, land or open water takes its place.
Both land and open water are less reflective than ice, and so absorb more solar radiation.
This causes more warming, which in turn causes more melting, and the cycle continues.Due to the thermal inertia of the earth's oceans and slow responses of other indirect effects, the Earth's current climate is not in equilibrium with the forcing imposed by increased greenhouse gases.
Climate commitment studies indicate that, even if greenhouse gases were stabilized at present day levels, a further warming of perhaps 0.5 °C to 1.0 °C (0.9–1.8 °F) would still occur.
Greenhouse gases are transparent to shortwave radiation from the sun, the main source of heat on the Earth.
However, they absorb some of the longer infrared radiation emitted by the Earth, thereby reducing radiational cooling and hence raising the temperature of the Earth.
How much they warm the world by is shown in their global warming potential.
The atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane have increased by 31% and 149% respectively above pre-industrial levels since 1750.
This is considerably higher than at any time during the last 650,000 years, the period for which reliable data has been extracted from ice cores.
From less direct geological evidence it is believed that carbon dioxide values this high were last attained 40 million years ago.
About three-quarters of the anthropogenic (man-made) emissions of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere during the past 20 years are due to fossil fuel burning.
The rest of the anthropogenic emissions are predominantly due to land-use change, especially deforestation.
The longest continuous instrumental measurement of carbon dioxide mixing ratios began in 1958 at Mauna Loa.
Since then, the annually averaged value has increased monotonically by approximately 21% from the initial reading of 315 ppmv, as shown by the Keeling curve, to over 380 ppmv in 2006.
The monthly CO2 measurements display small seasonal oscillations in an overall yearly uptrend; each year's maximum is reached during the northern hemisphere's late spring and declines during the northern hemisphere growing season as plants remove some CO2 from the atmosphere.
Methane, the primary constituent of natural gas, enters the atmosphere both from biological production and leaks from natural gas pipelines and other infrastructure.
Some biological sources are natural, such as termites or forests, but others have been increased or created by agricultural activities such as the cultivation of rice paddies.
Recent evidence indicates that methane concentrations have begun to stabilize, perhaps due to reductions in leakage from fuel transmission and storage facilities.
Future carbon dioxide levels are expected to continue rising due to ongoing fossil fuel usage, though the actual trajectory will depend on uncertain economic, sociological, technological, and natural developments.
The IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios gives a wide range of future carbon dioxide scenarios [19], ranging from 541 to 970 parts per million by the year 2100.
Fossil fuel reserves are sufficient to reach this level and continue emissions past 2100, if coal and tar sands are extensively used.
Positive feedback effects, such as the expected release of methane from the melting of permafrost peat bogs in Siberia (possibly up to 70,000 million tonnes), may lead to significant additional sources of greenhouse gas emissions.
Note that the anthropogenic emissions of other pollutants—notably sulfate aerosols—exert a cooling effect; this partially accounts for the plateau/cooling seen in the temperature record in the middle of the twentieth century, though this may also be due to intervening natural cycles.
The extent of the scientific consensus on global warming—that "most of the observed warming over the last 50 years is likely to have been attributable to human activities"—has been investigated: In the journal Science in December 2004, Dr Naomi Oreskes published a study of the abstracts of 928 refereed scientific articles in the ISI citation database identified with the keywords "global climate change".
This study concluded that 75% of the 928 articles either explicitly or implicitly accepted the consensus view — the remainder of the articles covered methods or paleoclimate and did not take any stance on recent climate change.
The study did not report how many of the 928 abstracts explicitly endorsed the hypothesis of human-induced warming, but none of the 928 articles surveyed explicitly endorsed an alternative hypothesis.
The warming is a consequence of coming out of a prior cool period, namely the Little Ice Age.
The warming is primarily a result of variances in solar irradiance, possibly via modulation of cloud cover .
It is similar in concept to the operating principles of the Wilson cloud chamber, but on a global scale where earth's atmosphere acts as the cloud chamber and the cosmic rays catalyze the production of cloud condensation nuclei.
Modeling studies reported in the IPCC Third Assessment Report (TAR) did not find that changes in solar forcing were needed in order to explain the climate record for the last four or five decades].
These studies found that volcanic and solar forcings may account for half of the temperature variations prior to 1950, but the net effect of such natural forcings has been roughly neutral since then.
In particular, the change in climate forcing from greenhouse gases since 1750 was estimated to be eight times larger than the change in forcing due to increasing solar activity over the same period].
Since the TAR, some studies (Lean et al., 2002, Wang et al., 2005) have suggested that changes in irradiance since pre-industrial times are less by a factor of 3 to 4 than in the reconstructions used in the TAR (e.g.
Hoyt and Schatten, 1993, Lean, 2000.).
Other researchers (e.g.
Stott et al.
2003) believe that the effect of solar forcing is being underestimated and propose that solar forcing accounts for 16% or 36% of recent greenhouse warming.
Others (e.g.
Marsh and Svensmark 2000) have proposed that feedback from clouds or other processes enhance the direct effect of solar variation, which if true would also suggest that the effect of solar variability was being underestimated.
In general the level of scientific understanding of the contribution of variations in solar irradiance to historical climate changes is "very low".
The present level of solar activity is historically high.
Solanki et al.
(2004) suggest that solar activity for the last 60 to 70 years may be at its highest level in 8,000 years; Muscheler et al.
disagree, suggesting that other comparably high levels of activity have occurred several times in the last few thousand years.
Solanki concluded based on their analysis that there is a 92% probability that solar activity will decrease over the next 50 years.
In addition, researchers at Duke University (2005) have found that 10–30% of the warming over the last two decades may be due to increased solar output.
In a review of existing literature, Foukal et al.
(2006) determined both that the variations in solar output were too small to have contributed appreciably to global warming since the mid-1970s and that there was no evidence of a net increase in brightness during this period.
The expected effects of global warming are many and various, both for the environment and for human life.
These effects include sea level rise, repercussions to agriculture, reductions in the ozone layer, increased intensity and frequency of extreme weather events, and the spread of disease.
In some cases, the effects may already be manifest, although it is difficult to attribute specific incidents of natural phenomena to long-term global warming.
Since the mid-1970s, the total annual power of hurricanes has increased markedly because their average intensity and duration have increased; in addition, there has been a high correlation of hurricane power with tropical sea-surface temperature.
In spite of such strong evidence, the relationship between global warming and hurricanes is still being debated.
] A draft statement by the World Meteorological Organization acknowledges the differing viewpoints on this issue.
The extent and probability of these consequences is a matter of considerable uncertainty.
A summary of probable effects and recent understanding can be found in the report of the IPCC Working Group II.
Some scientists have concluded global warming is already causing death and disease across the world through flooding, environmental destruction, heat waves and other extreme weather events.
(Reuters, February 9, 2006; archived)
Both primary and secondary effects of global warming — such as higher temperatures, lessened snow cover, rising sea levels and weather changes — may influence not only human activities, but also ecosystems.
Some species may be forced out of their habitats (possibly to extinction) because of changing conditions, while others may flourish.
Similarly, changes in timing of life patterns, such as annual migration dates, may alter regional predator-prey balance.
The effect of advanced spring arrival dates in Scandinavia on birds that over winter in sub-Saharan Africa has been ascribed to evolutionary adaptation of the species to climatic warming.
Ocean pH is lowering as a result of increased carbon dioxide levels.
Lowering of ocean pH, along with changing water temperature and ocean depth will have a damaging effect on coral reefs.
Another suggested mechanism whereby a warming trend may be amplified involves the thawing of tundra, which can release significant amounts of the potent greenhouse gas, methane, which is trapped in permafrost and ice clathrate compounds.
There are also ecological effects of melting polar ice: for example, polar bears use sea ice to reach their prey and they must swim to another ice floe when one breaks up.
Ice is now becoming further separated and dead polar bears have been found in the water, believed to have drowned.
More recently, some scientists have suggested that the observed cannibalistic behavior in polar bears may be the result of food shortages brought on by global warming (Amstrup et al.
2006).
Global glacial mass balance in the last fifty years, reported to the WGMS and the NSIDC.
The increased downward trend in the late 1980s is symptomatic of the increased rate and number of retreating glaciers.Global warming has led to negative glacier mass balance, causing glacier retreat around the world.
Oerlemans (2005) showed a net decline in 142 of the 144 mountain glaciers with records from 1900 to 1980.
Since 1980 global glacier retreat has increased significantly.
Similarly, Dyurgerov and Meier (2005) averaged glacier data across large-scale regions (e.g.
Europe) and found that every region had a net decline from 1960 to 2002, though a few local regions (e.g.
Scandinavia) have shown increases.
Some glaciers that are in disequilibrium with present climate have already disappeared and increasing temperatures are expected to cause continued retreat in the majority of alpine glaciers around the world.
Upwards of 90% of glaciers reported to the World Glacier Monitoring Service have retreated since 1995.
Rock glaciers — caches of ice under boulders — are among other water signs such as drying meadows and warming lakes that scientists are studying in the Sierras in the western United States.
Connie Millar searches for the rock glaciers in the Yosemite area of the Sierra crest.
She hypothesizes that rock glaciers will be predictors of how ecosystems change with rising temperatures.
Millar is leading an effort (the Consortium for Integrated Climate Research in Western Mountains) to co-ordinate the work of many scientists to see how the pieces of the Global Warming puzzle may fit.
There is also some speculation that global warming could, via a shutdown or slowdown of the thermohaline circulation, trigger localized cooling in the North Atlantic and lead to cooling, or lesser warming, in that region.
This would affect in particular areas like Scandinavia and Britain that are warmed by the North Atlantic drift.
The termini of the glaciers in the Bhutan-Himalaya.
Glacial lakes have been rapidly forming on the surface of the debris-covered glaciers in this region during the last few decades.
According to USGS researchers, glaciers in the Himalaya are wasting at alarming and accelerating rates, as indicated by comparisons of satellite and historic data, and as shown by the widespread, rapid growth of lakes on the glacier surfaces.
The researchers have found a strong correlation between increasing temperatures and glacier retreat.Rising global temperatures will melt glaciers and expand the water of the seas through the mechanism of thermal expansion, leading to sea level rise.
Even a relatively small rise in sea level would make some densely settled coastal plains uninhabitable and create a significant refugee problem.
If the sea level were to rise in excess of 4 meters (13 ft) almost every coastal city in the world would be severely affected, with the potential for major damage to world-wide trade and economy.
Presently, the IPCC predicts sea level rise is most probable to be just short of half a metre, and at least between 9 and 88 cm through 2100 - but they also warn that global warming during that time may lead to irreversible changes in the Earth's glacial system and ultimately melt enough ice to raise sea level many meters over the next millennia.
It is estimated that around 200 million people could be affected by sea level rise, especially in Vietnam, Bangladesh, China, India, Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia, Nigeria and Egypt.
An example of the ambiguity of the concept of environmental refugees is the emigration from the island nation of Tuvalu, which has an average elevation of approximately one meter above sea level.
Tuvalu already has an ad hoc agreement with New Zealand to allow phased relocation and many residents have been leaving the islands.
However, it is far from clear that rising sea levels from global warming are a substantial factor - best estimates are that sea level has been rising there at approximately 1–2 millimeters per year (~1/16th in/yr), but that shorter timescale factors—ENSO, or tides—have far larger temporary effects.
Global warming may extend the range of vectors conveying infectious diseases such as malaria.
A warmer environment boosts the reproduction rate of mosquitoes and the number of blood meals they take, prolongs their breeding season, and shortens the maturation period for the microbes they disperse].
Global warming has been implicated in the recent spread to the north Mediterranean region of bluetongue disease in domesticated ruminants associated with mite bites (Purse, 2005).
Hantavirus infection, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, tularemia and rabies increased in wide areas of Russia during 2004–2005.
This was associated with a population explosion of rodents and their predators but may be partially blamed on breakdowns in governmental vaccination and rodent control programs.
Similarly, despite the disappearance of malaria in most temperate regions, the indigenous mosquitoes that transmitted it were never eliminated and remain common in some areas.
Thus, although temperature is important in the transmission dynamics of malaria, many other factors are influential.
Financial institutions, including the world's two largest insurance companies, Munich Re and Swiss Re, warned in a 2002 study (UNEP summary) that "the increasing frequency of severe climatic events, coupled with social trends" could cost almost US$150 billion each year in the next decade.
These costs would, through increased costs related to insurance and disaster relief, burden customers, taxpayers, and industry alike.
According to the Association of British Insurers, limiting carbon emissions could avoid 80% of the projected additional annual cost of tropical cyclones by the 2080s.
According to Choi and Fisher (2003) each 1% increase in annual precipitation could enlarge catastrophe loss by as much as 2.8%.
The United Nations' Environmental Program recently announced that severe weather around the world has made 2005 the most costly year on record.
Although there is "no way to prove that [a given hurricane] either was, or was not, affected by global warming", global warming is thought to increase the probability of hurricanes emerging.
Preliminary estimates presented by the German insurance foundation Munich Re put the economic losses at more than US$200 billion, with insured losses running at more than US$70 billion.
Nicholas Stern in the Stern Review has warned that one percent of global GDP is required to be invested in order to mitigate the effects of climate change, and that failure to do so could risk a recession worth up to twenty percent of global GDP.
Stern’s report suggests that climate change threatens to be the greatest and widest-ranging market failure ever seen.
The report has had significant political effects: Australia reported two days after the report was released that they would allott AU$60 million to projects to help cut greenhouse gas emissions.
Tony Blair said the Stern Review showed that scientific evidence of global warming was "overwhelming" and its consequences "disastrous".
The creation of biomass by plants is influenced by the availability of water, nutrients, and carbon dioxide.
Part of this biomass is used (directly or indirectly) as the energy source for nearly all other life forms, including feed-stock for domestic animals, and fruits and grains for human consumption.
It also includes timber for construction purposes.
While it's thought that an increase in carbon dioxide levels should speed up plant growth, which would slow down the effects of global warming, a new study has found the opposite to be true.
Scientists at Stanford have found that "elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide actually reduces plant growth when combined with other likely consequences of climate change -- namely, higher temperatures, increased precipitation or increased nitrogen deposits in the soil.
" A rising temperature can also increase the growing season in colder regions.
It is sometimes argued that these effects can create a greener, richer planet, with more available biomass.
However, there are many other factors involved, and it is currently unclear if plants really benefit from global warming.
Plant growth can be limited by a number of factors, including soil fertility, water, temperature, and carbon dioxide concentration.
Ocean plants (phytoplankton) are actually harmed by global warming, presumably with negative impact on ocean ecosystems.
Satellite data show that the productivity of the northern hemisphere did indeed increase from 1982 to 1991.
However, more recent studies found that from 1991 to 2002, widespread droughts had actually caused a decrease in summer photosynthesis in the mid and high latitudes of the northern hemisphere.
NOAA projects that by the 2050s, there will only be 54% of the volume of sea ice there was in the 1950s.
Melting Arctic ice may open the Northwest Passage in summer in approximately ten years, which would cut 5,000 nautical miles (9,300 km) from shipping routes between Europe and Asia.
This would be of particular relevance for supertankers that are too big to fit through the Suez Canal and currently have to go around the southern tip of Africa.
According to the Canadian Ice Service, the amount of ice in Canada's eastern Arctic Archipelago decreased by 15% between 1969 and 2004.
A similar opening is possible in the Arctic north of Siberia, allowing much faster East Asian to Europe transport.
Some effects of global warming themselves contribute directly to further global warming, in a vicious circle, the nature of which may be difficult to predict in advance.
Melting could also lead to increased heat absorption because ice reflects more solar radiation (i.e., it has higher albedo) than land or water.
Because sea ice and seasonal snow cover are more reflective than the underlying sea, any meltback may lead to further warming.
Warmer temperatures in the oceans reduce the productivity (growth) of ocean phytoplankton (algae).
This is expected to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide taken up by photosynthesis in the ocean, which would again increase the effects of anthropogenic CO2 releases on the overall amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, and hence increase the greenhouse effect.
This is a concern because ocean photosynthesis is as large a part of the planet's overall carbon balance as land photosynthesis.
The Energy Information Administration predicts world energy and fossil fuel usage will rise in the next decades.The likelihood that global temperatures will continue to significantly increase has led to proposals to mitigate global warming.
Mitigation covers all actions aimed at reducing the negative effects or the likelihood of global warming.There are five categories of actions that can be taken to mitigate global warming:
Strategies for mitigation of global warming include development of new technologies; carbon offsets; renewable energy such as biodiesel, wind power, and solar power; nuclear power; electric or hybrid automobiles; fuel cells; energy conservation; carbon taxes; enhancing natural carbon dioxide sinks; population control; and carbon capture and storage.
Many environmental groups encourage individual action against global warming, often aimed at the consumer, and there has been business action on climate change.
The world's primary international agreement on combating climate change is the Kyoto Protocol.
The Kyoto Protocol is an amendment to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
Countries that ratify this protocol commit to reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases, or engage in emissions trading if they maintain or increase emissions of these gases.
Although the governments of 163 countries ratified the Kyoto Protocol, (notably excluding the United States and Australia), there is a growing debate about how effective the Kyoto protocol has been.
Some politicians, including President of the United States George W. Bush, Prime Minister of Australia John Howard had argued that the cost of mitigating global warming via the Kyoto protocol is too large to be practical.
This view may be proving correct, as the signatories of the Kyoto protocol are currently struggling to meet their targets, including Europe and Japan.
After only five years, Canada has given up entirely.
Also, of the 163 countries that have signed and ratified Kyoto, only 31 are actually required to lower greenhouse emissions.
Some segments of the business community have accepted global warming and its attribution to anthropogenic causes as valid, as well as a need for actions such as carbon emissions trading and carbon taxes.Adaptation strategies accept some warming as a foregone conclusion and focus on preventing or reducing undesirable consequences.
Examples of such strategies include defense against rising sea levels or ensuring food security.
Calculations of global warming from a range of climate models under the SRES A2 emissions scenario, which assumes no action is taken to reduce emissions.
The geographic distribution of surface warming during the 21st century calculated by the HadCM3 climate model if a business as usual scenario is assumed for economic growth and greenhouse gas emissions.
In this figure, the globally averaged warming corresponds to 3.0 °C (5.4 °F)
Scientists have studied global warming with computer models of the climate (see below).
Before the scientific community accepts a climate model, it has to be validated against observed climate variations.
As of 2006, sufficiently high-resolution models successfully simulate summer/winter differences, the North Atlantic Oscillation[citation needed], and El Niño.
All validated current models predict that the net effect of adding greenhouse gases will be a warmer climate in the future.
However, the amount of predicted warming varies by model, and there still remains a considerable range of climate sensitivity predicted by the models which survive these tests; one of the most important sources of this uncertainty is believed to be different ways of handling clouds.
Part of the technical summary of the IPCC TAR includes a recognition of the need to quantify this uncertainty: "In climate research and modeling, we should recognize that we are dealing with a coupled non-linear system, and therefore that the prediction of a specific future climate is not possible.
Rather the focus must be on the probability distribution of the system's possible future states by the generation of ensembles of model solutions.
"An example of a study which aims to do this is the Climateprediction.net project; their methodology is to investigate the range of climate sensitivities predicted for the 21st century by those models which are first shown to give a reasonable simulation of late 20th century climate change.
As noted above, climate models have been used by the IPCC to anticipate a warming of 1.4 °C to 5.8 °C (2.5 °F–10.4 °F) between 1990 and 2100 [85].
They have also been used to help investigate the causes of recent climate change by comparing the observed changes to those that the models predict from various natural and human derived forcing factors.
In addition to having their own characteristic climate sensitivity, models have also been used to derive independent assessments of climate sensitivity.
Climate models can produce a good match to observations of global temperature changes over the last century [86].
These models do not unambiguously attribute the warming that occurred from approximately 1910 to 1945 to either natural variation or human effects; however, they suggest that the warming since 1975 is dominated by man-made greenhouse gas emissions.
Adding simulation of the carbon cycle to the models generally shows a positive feedback, though this response is uncertain (under the A2 SRES scenario, responses vary between an extra 20 and 200 ppm of CO2).
Some observational studies also show a positive feedback [87].
Uncertainties in the representation of clouds are a dominant source of uncertainty in existing models, despite clear progress in modeling of clouds [88].
There is also an ongoing discussion as to whether climate models are neglecting important indirect and feedback effects of solar variability.
Further, all such models are limited by available computational power, so that they may overlook changes related to small-scale processes and weather (e.g.
storm systems, hurricanes).
However, despite these and other limitations, the IPCC considered climate models "to be suitable tools to provide useful projections of future climates" [89].
In December, 2005 Bellouin et al.
suggested in Nature that the reflectivity effect of airborne pollutants was about double that previously expected, and that therefore some global warming was being masked.
If supported by further studies, this would imply that existing models under-predict future global warming.
[90]
Although global warming has been seen as potentially dangerous for some time, the first international attempt to define what constitutes a 'dangerous' level occurred at the Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change scientific conference in February 2005.
This took place in Exeter, United Kingdom under the UK presidency of the G8 [91].
At the conference it was said that increasing damage was forecast if the globe warms to about 1 to 3 °Celsius (1.8 to 5.4 °Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels.
It was concluded that the stabilization of greenhouse gases at the equivalent of 450 ppmv CO2 would provide a 50% likelihood of limiting global warming to the average figure of 2 °C (3.6 °F).
Stabilization below 400 ppm would give a relatively high certainty of not exceeding 2 °C, while stabilization at 550 ppm would mean it was likely that 2 °C would be exceeded.
It was stated that unless 'urgent and strenuous mitigation actions' were taken in the next 20 years, it was almost certain that by 2050 global temperatures will have risen to between 0.5 and 2 °C (0.9 and 3.6°F) above current levels.
With carbon dioxide levels currently around 381 ppm and rising by 2ppm per year, without such action greenhouse gasses are likely to reach 400ppm by 2016, 450ppm by 2041, and 550ppm by around 2091.
Increased atmospheric carbon dioxide increases the amount of CO2 dissolved in the oceans.
This ameliorates the greenhouse effect by removing the greenhouse gas from the atmosphere.
Unfortunately, carbon dioxide gas dissolved in the ocean reacts with water to form carbonic acid.
The net effect, even accounting for warming of the oceans, is an observed and accelerating ocean acidification.
Since biosystems are adapted to a narrow range of pH this is a very serious concern directly driven by increased atmospheric CO2 and not global warming.
Ocean acidification would not be created by any other postulated climate change mechanisms.
In fact, the result of these other forcings would be to decrease the acidity of the oceans as the sea temperature warmed.
This is exactly contrary to what has been observed.
Roger Revelle and Hans Suess first described the chemistry of the process.
Although they are often interlinked in the mass media, the connection between global warming and ozone depletion is not strong.
There are five areas of linkage:
The same carbon dioxide radiative forcing that produces near-surface global warming is expected (perhaps somewhat surprisingly) to cool the stratosphere.
This, in turn, would lead to a relative increase in ozone depletion and the frequency of ozone holes.
Radiative forcing from various greenhouse gases and other sourcesConversely, ozone depletion represents a radiative forcing of the climate system.
There are two opposed effects: 1) reduced ozone allows more solar radiation to penetrate, thus warming the troposphere instead of the stratosphere.
2) The resulting colder stratosphere emits less long-wave radiation down to the troposphere, thus having a cooling effect.
Overall, the cooling dominates: the IPCC concludes that observed stratospheric O3 losses over the past two decades have caused a negative forcing of the surface-troposphere system [92] of about -0.15 ± 0.10 W/m² [93].
One of the strongest predictions of the greenhouse effect theory is that the stratosphere will cool.
Although this cooling has been observed, it is not trivial to separate the effects of changes in the concentration of greenhouse gases and ozone depletion since both will lead to cooling.
However, this can be done by numerical stratospheric modeling.
Results from the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory show that above 20 km, the greenhouse gases dominate the cooling.
[94]
Ozone depleting chemicals are also greenhouse gases, representing 0.34 ±0.03 W/m², or about 14% of the total radiative forcing from well-mixed greenhouse gases [95].
Decreased ozone leads to an increase in ultraviolet levels.
Ultraviolet radiation may be responsible for the death of ocean algae, which operate as a carbon dioxide sink in the ocean.
Increased UV, therefore, may lead to a decrease in carbon dioxide uptake, thereby raising global carbon dioxide levels.
[96]
Some scientists now consider that the effects of global dimming (the reduction in sunlight reaching the surface of the planet, possibly due to aerosols) may have masked some of the effect of global warming.
If this is so, the indirect aerosol effect is stronger than previously believed, which would imply that the climate sensitivity to greenhouse gases is also stronger.
Concerns about the effect of aerosol on the global climate were first researched as part of concerns over global cooling in the 1970s.
The Earth has experienced natural global warming and cooling many times in the past, and can offer useful insights into present processes.
It is thought by some geologists that a rapid buildup of greenhouse gases caused the Earth to experience global warming in the early Jurassic period, with average temperatures rising by 5 °C (9.0 °F).
Research by the Open University published in Geology (32: 157–160, 2004 [97]) indicates that this caused the rate of rock weathering to increase by 400%.
As such weathering locks away carbon in calcite and dolomite, carbon dioxide levels dropped back to normal over roughly the next 150,000 years.
Sudden releases of methane from clathrate compounds (the Clathrate Gun Hypothesis) have been hypothesized as a cause for other past global warming events, including the Permian-Triassic extinction event and the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum.
However, warming at the end of the last glacial period is thought not to be due to methane release [98].
Instead, natural variations in the Earth's orbit (Milankovitch cycles) are believed to have triggered the retreat of ice sheets by changing the amount of solar radiation received at high latitude and led to deglaciation.
The greenhouse effect is also invoked to explain how the Earth made it out of the Snowball Earth period 600 million years ago.
During this period all silicate rocks were covered by ice, thereby preventing them from combining with atmospheric carbon dioxide.
The atmospheric carbon dioxide level gradually increased until it reached a level that could have been as much as 350 times the current level.
At this point temperatures were raised enough to melt the ice, even though the reflective ice surfaces had been reflecting most sunlight back into space.
Increased amounts of rainfall would quickly wash the carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, and thick layers of abiotic carbonate sediment have been found on top of the glacial rocks from this period.
Using paleoclimate data for the last 500 million years Veizer et al.
(2000, Nature 408, pp.
698–701) concluded that long-term temperature variations are only weakly related to carbon dioxide variations.
Most paleoclimatologists believe this is because other factors, such as continental drift and mountain building have larger effects in determining very long term climate.
However, Shaviv and Veizer (2003, [99]) proposed that the biggest long-term influence on temperature is actually the solar system's motion around the galaxy, and the ways in which this influences the atmosphere by altering the flux of cosmic rays received by the Earth.
Afterwards, they argued that over geologic times a change in carbon dioxide concentrations comparable to doubling pre-industrial levels, only results in about 0.75 °C (1.3 °F) warming rather than the usual 1.5–4.5 °C (2.7–8.1 °F) reported by climate models [100].
They acknowledge (Shaviv and Veizer 2004) however that this conclusion may only be valid on multi-million year time scales when glacial and geological feedback have had a chance to establish themselves.
Rahmstorf et al.
2004 [101] argue that S+V have highly and arbitrarily tuned their data, and that their conclusions are unreliable.
Paleoclimatologist William Ruddiman has argued (e.g., Scientific American, March 2005) that human influence on the global climate began around 8,000 years ago with the start of forest clearing to provide land for agriculture and 5,000 years ago with the start of Asian rice irrigation.
He contends that forest clearing explains the rise in carbon dioxide levels in the current interglacial that started 8,000 years ago, contrasting with the decline in carbon dioxide levels seen in the previous three interglacials.
He further contends that the spread of rice irrigation explains the breakdown in the last 5,000 years of the correlation between the Northern Hemisphere solar radiation and global methane levels, which had been maintained over at least the last 11 22,000-year cycles.
Ruddiman argues that without these effects, the Earth would be nearly 2 °C cooler and "well on the way" to a new ice age.
Ruddimann's interpretation of the historical record, with respect to the methane data, has been disputed.
Climate changes reflect variations within the Earth's environment, natural processes going on around it, and the impact of human activity.
The external factors which can shape climate are often called climate forcings and include such processes as variations in solar radiation, the Earth's orbit, and greenhouse gas concentrations.
Weather, in and of itself, is a chaotic non-linear dynamical system, but in many cases, it is observed that the climate (i.e., the average state of weather) is fairly stable and predictable.
This includes the average temperature, amount of precipitation, days of sunlight, and many other variables that might be measured at any given site.
However, there are also changes within the Earth's environment that can affect the climate.
Glaciers are recognized as one of the most sensitive indicators of climate change, advancing substantially during climate cooling (e.g., the Little Ice Age) and retreating during climate warming on moderate time scales.
Glaciers grow and collapse, both contributing to natural variability and greatly amplifying external forces.
For the last century, however, glaciers have been unable to regenerate enough ice during the winters to make up for the ice lost during the summer months (see glacier retreat).
The most important climate processes of the last several million years are the glacial and interglacial cycles of the present ice age.
Though shaped by orbital variations, the internal responses involving continental ice sheets and 130 m sea-level change certainly played a key role in deciding what climate response would be observed in most regions.
Other changes, including Heinrich events, Dansgaard–Oeschger events and the Younger Dryas show the potential for glacial variations to influence climate even in the absence of specific orbital changes.
A schematic of modern thermohaline circulationOn the scale of mere decades, climate changes can also result from changes within the ocean/atmosphere systems.
Many climate states, most obviously El Niño Southern oscillation, but also including the Pacific decadal oscillation, the North Atlantic oscillation, and the Arctic oscillation, have been recognized as modes within the climate system, owing their existence at least in part to different ways that heat can be stored in the oceans and move between different reservoirs.
On longer time scales, ocean processes such as thermohaline circulation play a key role in redistributing heat, and could, if changed, dramatically impact climate.
More generally, most forms of internal variability in the climate system can be recognized as a form of hysteresis, meaning that the current state of climate reflects not only the inputs, but also the history of how it got there.
For example, a decade of dry conditions may cause lakes to shrink, plains to dry up and deserts to expand.
In turn, these conditions may lead to less rainfall in the following years.
In short, climate change can be a self-perpetuating process because different aspects of the environment respond at different rates and in different ways to the fluctuations that inevitably occur.
Carbon dioxide variations during the last 500 million yearsCurrent studies indicate that radiative forcing by greenhouse gases is the primary cause of global warming.
Greenhouse gases are also important in understanding Earth's climate history.
According to these studies, the greenhouse effect, which is the warming produced as greenhouse gases trap heat, plays a key role in regulating Earth's temperature.
Over the last 600 million years, carbon dioxide concentrations have varied from perhaps >5000 ppm to less than 200 ppm, due primarily to the impact of geological processes and biological innovations.
Curiously, it has been argued (Veizer et al.
1999) that variations in greenhouse gas concentrations over tens of millions of years have not been well correlated to climate change, with plate tectonics perhaps playing a more dominant role.
However, there are several examples of rapid changes in the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere that do appear to correlate to strong warming, including the Paleocene–Eocene thermal maximum, the Permian–Triassic extinction event, and the end of the Varangian snowball earth event.During the modern era, rising carbon dioxide levels are implicated as the primary cause to global warming since 1950.
On the longest time scales, plate tectonics will reposition continents, shape oceans, build and tear down mountains and generally serve to define the stage upon which climate exists.
More recently, plate motions have been implicated in the intensification of the present ice age when, approximately 3 million years ago, the North and South American plates collided to form the Isthmus of Panama and shut off direct mixing between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.
Variations in solar activity during the last several centuries based on observations of sunspots and beryllium isotopes.The sun is the ultimate source of essentially all heat in the climate system.
The energy output of the sun, which is converted to heat at the earth's surface, is an integral part of shaping the Earth's climate.
On the longest time scales, the sun itself is getting brighter with higher energy output; as it continues its main sequence, this slow change or evolution effects the earths atmosphere.
Early in Earth's history, it is thought to have been too cold to support liquid water at the Earth's surface, leading to what is known as the Faint young sun paradox.
On more modern time scales, there are also a variety of forms of solar variation, including the 11–year solar cycle and longer-term modulations.
However, the 11–year sunspot cycle does not manifest itself clearly in the climatological data.
Solar intensity variations are considered to have been influential in triggering the Little Ice Age, and for some of the warming observed from 1900 to 1950.
The cyclical nature of the sun's energy output is not yet fully understood; it differs from the very slow change that is occurring to the sun as it ages and evolves.
In their impact on climate, orbital variations are in some sense an extension of solar variability, because slight variations in the Earth's orbit lead to changes in the distribution and abundance of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface.
Such orbital variations, known as Milankovitch cycles, are a highly predictable consequence of basic physics due to the mutual interactions of the Earth, its moon, and the other planets.
These variations are considered the driving factors underlying the glacial and interglacial cycles of the present ice age.
Subtler variations are also present, such as the repeated advance and retreat of the Sahara desert in response to orbital precession.
A single eruption of the kind that occurs several times per century can impact climate, causing cooling for a period of a few years.
For example, the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 is barely visible on the global temperature profile.
Huge eruptions, known as large igneous provinces, occur only a few times every hundred million years, but can reshape climate for millions of years and cause mass extinctions.
Initially, scientists thought that the dust emitted into the atmosphere from large volcanic eruptions was responsible for the cooling by partially blocking the transmission of solar radiation to the Earth's surface.
However, measurements indicate that most of the dust thrown in the atmosphere returns to the Earth's surface within six months.
Anthropogenic factors are acts by humans that change the environment and influence climate.
The biggest factor of present concern is the increase in CO2 levels due to emissions from fossil fuel combustion, followed by aerosols (particulate matter in the atmosphere) which exerts a cooling effect.
Other factors, including land use, ozone depletion, and deforestation also impact climate.
Carbon dioxide variations over the last 400,000 years, showing a rise since the industrial revolution.Beginning with the industrial revolution in the 1850s and accelerating ever since, the human consumption of fossil fuels has elevated CO2 levels from a concentration of ~280 ppm to more than 370 ppm today.
These increases are projected to reach more than 560 ppm before the end of the 21st century.
Along with rising methane levels, these changes are anticipated to cause an increase of 1.4–5.6 °C between 1990 and 2100 (see global warming).
Prior to widespread fossil fuel use, humanity's largest impact on local climate is likely to have resulted from land use.
Irrigation, deforestation, and agriculture fundamentally change the environment.
For example, they change the amount of water going into and out of a given locale.
They also may change the local albedo by influencing the ground cover and altering the amount of sunlight which is absorbed.
For example, there is evidence to suggest that the climate of Greece and other Mediterranean countries was permanently changed by widespread deforestation between 700 BC and 0 BC (the wood being used for ship-building, construction and fuel purposes), with the result that the modern climate in the region is significantly hotter and drier and the species of trees which were used for ship-building in the ancient world can no longer be found in the area.
A controversial hypothesis by William Ruddiman [1] suggests that the rise of agriculture and the accompanying deforestation led to the increases in carbon dioxide and methane during the period 5000–8000 years ago.
These increases, which reversed previous declines, may have been responsible for delaying the onset of the next glacial period, according to Ruddimann's hypothesis.
If a certain forcing (for example, solar variation) acts to change the climate, then there may be mechanisms which act to amplify or reduce the effects.
These are called positive and negative feedbacks.
As far as is known, the climate system is generally stable with respect to these feedbacks: positive feedbacks do not "run away".
Part of the reason for this is the existence of a powerful negative feedback between temperature and emitted radiation: radiation increases as the fourth power of absolute temperature.
However, a number of important positive feedbacks do exist.
The glacial and interglacial cycles of the present ice age provide an important example.
It is believed that orbital variations provide the timing for the growth and retreat of ice sheets.
However, the ice sheets themselves reflect sunlight back into space and hence promote cooling and their own growth, known as the ice–albedo feedback.
Further, falling sea levels and expanding ice decrease plant growth and indirectly lead to declines in carbon dioxide and methane.
This leads to further cooling.
Water vapor, methane, and carbon dioxide can also act as significant positive feedbacks, their levels rising in response to a warming trend, thereby accelerating that trend.
Water vapor acts strictly as a feedback (excepting small amounts in the stratosphere), unlike the other major greenhouse gases, which can also act as forcings.
More complex feedbacks involve the possibility of changing circulation patterns in the ocean or atmosphere.
For example, a significant concern in the modern case is that melting glacial ice from Greenland will interfere with sinking waters in the North Atlantic and inhibit thermohaline circulation.
This could affect the Gulf Stream and the distribution of heat to Europe and the east coast of the United States.
Other potential feedbacks are not well understood and may either inhibit or promote warming.
For example, it is unclear whether rising temperatures promote or inhibit vegetative growth, which could in turn draw down either more or less carbon dioxide.
Similarly, increasing temperatures may lead to either more or less cloud cover.
[3] Since on balance cloud cover has a strong cooling effect, any change to the abundance of clouds also impacts climate.
In all, it seems likely that overall climate feedbacks are negative, as systems with overall positive feedback are highly unstable.
Scientists use "Indicator time series" that represent the many aspects of climate and ecosystem status.
The time history provides an historical context.
Current status of the climate is also monitored with climate indices.
Evidence for climatic change is taken from a variety of sources which can be used to reconstruct past climates.
Most of the evidence is indirect—climatic changes are inferred from changes in indicators that reflect climate, such as vegetation, dendrochronology, ice cores, sea level change, glacial retreat.
Species have particular climatic requirements which influence their geographical distributions.
Each plant species has a distinctively shaped pollen grain and if these fall into oxygen-free environments, such as peat bogs, they resist decay.
Changes in the pollen found in different levels of the bog indicate, by implication, changes in climate.One limitation of this method is the fact that pollen can be transported considerable distances by wind or sometimes by wildlife.
Remains of Coleoptera beetles are common in freshwater and land sediments.
Different species of this beetle tend to be found under different climatic conditions.
Knowledge of the present climatic range of the different species, and the age of the sediments in which remains are found, allows past climatic conditions to be worked out.
Advancing glaciers leave behind moraines and other features which often have datable material in them, recording the time when a glacier advance and deposited a feature.
Similarly the lack of glacier cover can be identified by the presence of datable soil or volcanic tephra horizons.
Glaciers are considered one of the most sensitive climate indicators by the IPCC, and their recent observed variations provide a global signal of climate change, see Retreat of glaciers since 1850.
Historical records include cave paintings, depth of grave digging in Greenland, diaries, documentary evidence of events (such as 'frost fairs' on the Thames) and evidence of areas of vine cultivation.
Since 1873 daily weather reports have been documented, and the Royal Society has encouraged the collection of data since the seventeenth century.
Parish records are often a good source of climate data.
Climate change has continued throughout the entire history of Earth.
The field of paleoclimatology has provided information of climate change in the ancient past, supplementing modern observations of climate.
Obviously, these prehistoric changes are solely the result of natural factors.

The amount of carbon stored in the world’s tropical forests varies widely according to underlying geology and other factors, and current estimates of forest carbon reserves may be too high , according to a new study.
A research team from the Carnegie Institution for Science used satellite mapping, laser probing of forest undergrowth from aircraft, and local ground surveys to estimate how much carbon was stored in the 17,000-square-mile lowland forest in the Madre de Dios region of Peru.
The team’s surveys showed that the forest stored roughly 395 million tons of carbon — far less than the 587-million-ton estimate of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
The researchers, reporting in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, said that the earlier estimate was off because different tropical forests store varying amounts of carbon, and that forests where the underlying rocks are younger contain more carbon in soils and trees.
In another study, researchers said that the number of insect species in tropical forests also varies widely according to topography, and that montane tropical forests in the Ecuadorean Andes and highlands of Costa Rica contained six times more insect species than predicted.
More than 80 percent of the agricultural land created in the developing world between 1980 and 2000 came from cutting down tropical forests , a continuing trend that has serious implications for biodiversity loss and global warming, according to a study by Stanford University researchers.
Analyzing Landsat satellite data, the researchers determined that roughly half a million square miles of new farmland — an area roughly the size of Alaska — came into being in tropical regions during the 20-year period.
Roughly 55 percent of the felled tropical forests were intact forests and 28 percent were forests that had experienced some degradation, such as small-scale farming and logging.
Lead researcher Holly Gibbs said the destruction of so much tropical forest has major implications for climate change, since every million acres that is cut releases the same amount of carbon as 40 million cars.
Gibbs and her colleagues, reporting in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, said that population growth in the next half-century could mean a doubling of land needed for agriculture, likely leading to the loss of millions more acres of tropical forest.
But Gibbs highlighted one encouraging sign, which is that the main drivers of forest destruction now are not small farmers but big agribusiness, which is more susceptible to pressure campaigns from environmental groups and consumers.

Production of biochar (the carbon (C)-rich solid formed by pyrolysis of biomass) and its storage in soils have been suggested as a means of abating climate change by sequestering carbon, while simultaneously providing energy and increasing crop yields.
Substantial uncertainties exist, however, regarding the impact, capacity and sustainability of biochar at the global level.
In this paper we estimate the maximum sustainable technical potential of biochar to mitigate climate change.
Annual net emissions of carbon dioxide (CO
, without endangering food security, habitat or soil conservation.
Biochar has a larger climate-change mitigation potential than combustion of the same sustainably procured biomass for bioenergy, except when fertile soils are amended while coal is the fuel being offset.

Within each of these categories, the relative proportions of the components are approximated by the height/width of the coloured fields.
CO

A sustainable fraction of the total biomass produced each year, such as agricultural residues, biomass crops and agroforestry products, is converted by pyrolysis to yield bio-oil, syngas and process heat, together with a solid product, biochar, which is a recalcitrant form of carbon and suitable as a soil amendment.
The bio-oil and syngas are subsequently combusted to yield energy and CO
is returned to the atmosphere directly through combustion of bio-oil and syngas, through the slow decay of biochar in soils, and through the use of machinery to transport biomass to the pyrolysis facility, to transport biochar from the same facility to its disposal site and to incorporate biochar into the soil.
In contrast to bioenergy, in which all CO
that is fixed in the biomass by photosynthesis is returned to the atmosphere quickly as fossil carbon emissions are offset, biochar has the potential for even greater impact on climate through its enhancement of the productivity of infertile soils and its effects on soil GHG fluxes.
The data are for the three model scenarios over 100 years by feedstock and factor.
The left side of the figure displays results for each of eight feedstock types and the additional biomass residues that are attributed to NPP increases from biochar amendments; the right side displays total results by scenario for both biochar (left column) and biomass combustion (right column).
For each column, the total emission-avoiding and emission-generating contributions are given, respectively, by the height of the columns above and below the zero line.
The net avoided emissions are calculated as the difference between these two values.

Carbon intensity values for natural gas, oil and coal are also indicated.
The relative mitigation is calculated as cumulative avoided emissions for biochar minus those for bioenergy, expressed as a fraction of the avoided emissions for bioenergy (for example, a value of 0.1 indicates that the cumulative mitigation impact of biochar is 10% greater than that of bioenergy, a value of −0.1 indicates that it is 10% lower and a value of zero indicates that they have the same mitigation impact).

) emissions have risen by more than 3% annually 1 , putting Earth's ecosystems on a trajectory towards rapid climate change that is both dangerous and irreversible 2 .
To change this trajectory, a timely and ambitious programme of mitigation measures is needed.
Several studies have shown that, to stabilize global mean surface temperature, cumulative anthropogenic greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions must be kept below a maximum upper limit, thus indicating that future net anthropogenic emissions must approach zero 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 .
If humanity oversteps this threshold of maximum safe cumulative emissions (a limit that may already have been exceeded 7 ), no amount of emissions reduction will return the climate to within safe bounds.
Mitigation strategies that draw down excess CO
from the atmosphere would then assume an importance greater than an equivalent reduction in emissions.
Production of biochar, in combination with its storage in soils, has been suggested as one possible means of reducing the atmospheric CO
concentration (refs 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 and see also Supplementary Note for a history of the concept and etymology of the term).
Biochar's climate-mitigation potential stems primarily from its highly recalcitrant nature 14 , 15 , 16 , which slows the rate at which photosynthetically fixed carbon (C) is returned to the atmosphere.
In addition, biochar yields several potential co-benefits.
It is a source of renewable bioenergy; it can improve agricultural productivity, particularly in low-fertility and degraded soils where it can be especially useful to the world's poorest farmers; it reduces the losses of nutrients and agricultural chemicals in run-off; it can improve the water-holding capacity of soils; and it is producible from biomass waste 17 , 18 .
Of the possible strategies to remove CO
from the atmosphere, biochar is notable, if not unique, in this regard.
is removed from the atmosphere by photosynthesis.
Sustainably procured crop residues, manures, biomass crops, timber and forestry residues, and green waste are pyrolysed by modern technology to yield bio-oil, syngas, process heat and biochar.
As a result of pyrolysis, immediate decay of these biomass inputs is avoided.
The outputs of the pyrolysis process serve to provide energy, avoid emissions of GHGs such as methane (CH
O), and amend agricultural soils and pastures.
The bioenergy is used to offset fossil-fuel emissions, while returning about half of the C fixed by photosynthesis to the atmosphere.
In addition to the GHG emissions avoided by preventing decay of biomass inputs, soil emissions of GHGs are also decreased by biochar amendment to soils.
The biochar stores carbon in a recalcitrant form that can increase soil water- and nutrient-holding capacities, which typically result in increased plant growth.
This enhanced productivity is a positive feedback that further enhances the amount of CO
removed from the atmosphere.
Slow decay of biochar in soils, together with tillage and transport activities, also returns a small amount of CO
to the atmosphere.
A schematic of the model used to calculate the magnitudes of these processes is shown as Supplementary Figure S1 .
The figure shows inputs, process, outputs, applications and impacts on global climate.

Even under the most zealous investment programme, biochar production will ultimately be limited by the rate at which biomass can be extracted and pyrolysed without causing harm to the biosphere or to human welfare.
Globally, human activity is responsible for the appropriation of 16 Pg C per year from the biosphere, which corresponds to 24% of potential terrestrial net primary productivity (NPP) 22 .
Higher rates of appropriation will increase pressure on global ecosystems, exacerbating a situation that is already unsustainable 23 .
The main aim of this study is to provide an estimate of the theoretical upper limit, under current conditions, to the climate-change mitigation potential of biochar when implemented in a sustainable manner.
This limit, which we term the maximum sustainable technical potential (MSTP), represents what can be achieved when the portion of the global biomass resource that can be harvested sustainably (that is, without endangering food security, habitat or soil conservation) is converted to biochar by modern high-yield, low-emission, pyrolysis methods.
The fraction of the MSTP that is actually realized will depend on a number of socioeconomic factors, including the extent of government incentives and the relative emphasis placed on energy production relative to climate-change mitigation.
Aside from assuming a maximum rate of capital investment that is consistent with that estimated to be required for climate-change mitigation 24 , this study does not take into account any economic, social or cultural barriers that might further limit the adoption of biochar technology.
emissions.
The relative climate-mitigation potentials of biochar and bioenergy depend on the fertility of the soil amended and the C intensity of the fuel being offset, as well as the type of biomass.
Locations at which the soil fertility is high and coal is the fuel being offset are best suited for bioenergy production.
The climate-mitigation potential of biochar (with combined energy production) is higher for all other situations.
To ensure that our estimates represent a sustainable approach, we use a stringent set of criteria to assess potential feedstock availability for biochar production.
Of primary importance is the conversion of land to generate feedstock.
In addition to its negative effects on ecosystem conservation, land clearance to provide feedstock may also release carbon stored in soils and biomass, leading to unacceptably high carbon-payback times before any net reduction in atmospheric CO
is achieved (ref.
25 , Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Fig.
S2 ).
For example, we find that a land-use change carbon debt greater than 22 Mg C ha−1 (an amount that would be exceeded by conversion of temperate grassland to annual crops 25 ) will result in a carbon-payback time that is greater than 10 years.
Clearance of rainforests to provide land for biomass-crop production leads to carbon payback times in excess of 50 years.
Where rainforest on peatland is converted to biomass-crop production, carbon-payback times may be in the order of 325 years.
We therefore assume that no land clearance will be used to provide biomass feedstock, nor do we include conversion of agricultural land from food to biomass-crop production as a sustainable source of feedstock, both because of the negative consequences for food security and because it may indirectly induce land clearance elsewhere 26 .
Some dedicated biomass-crop production on abandoned, degraded agricultural soil has been included in this study as this will not adversely affect food security 27 and can improve biodiversity 28 , 29 .
We further assume that extraction rates of agricultural and forestry residues are sufficiently low to preclude soil erosion or loss of soil function, and that no industrially treated waste biomass posing a risk of soil contamination will be used.
Within these constraints, we derived a biomass-availability scenario for our estimate of MSTP, as well as two additional scenarios, Alpha and Beta, which represent lower demands on global biomass resources ( Table 1 ).
Attainment of the MSTP would require substantial alteration to global biomass management, but would not endanger food security, habitat or soil conservation.
The Alpha scenario restricts biomass availability to residues and wastes available using current technology and practices, together with a moderate amount of agroforestry and biomass cropping.
All three scenarios represent fairly ambitious projects, and require progressively greater levels of political intervention to promote greater adoption of sustainable land-use practices and increase the quantity of uncontaminated organic wastes available for pyrolysis.
We do not consider any scenarios that are not ambitious in this study, as the intention is to investigate whether biochar could make a substantial contribution to climate-change mitigation—an aspiration that certainly will not be accomplished by half-hearted measures.
The range of mitigation results reported thus refers only to the scenarios considered and does not encompass the full range of less-effective outcomes corresponding to varying levels of inaction.
The scenarios are based on current biomass availability ( Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 ), the composition and energy contents of different types of biomass and the biochar derived from each ( Supplementary Tables S3 and S4 ), and the rate of adoption of biochar technology ( Supplementary Fig.
S3 ).
How this biomass resource base changes over the course of 100 years will depend on the potential effects of changing climate, atmospheric CO
The data are for the three model scenarios over 100 years by feedstock and factor.
The left side of the figure displays results for each of eight feedstock types and the additional biomass residues that are attributed to NPP increases from biochar amendments; the right side displays total results by scenario for both biochar (left column) and biomass combustion (right column).
For each column, the total emission-avoiding and emission-generating contributions are given, respectively, by the height of the columns above and below the zero line.
The net avoided emissions are calculated as the difference between these two values.
Within each column, the portion of its contribution caused by each of six emission-avoiding mechanisms and three emission-generating mechanisms is shown by a different colour.
These mechanisms (from top to bottom within each column) are (1) avoided CH
to the net avoided emissions (if these increased crop residues are converted to biochar), followed by reductions in soil N
The relative importance of all these factors to the GHG budget varies considerably among feedstocks.
Notably, rice residues, green waste and manure achieve the highest ratios of avoided CO
O-N, from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change default values assumed in this study up to the higher rate of 5% suggested by more recent work 33 , 34 .
This would increase the net avoided GHG emissions by up to 8%.
Given that much of the increased climate mitigation from biochar relative to biomass combustion stems from the beneficial feedbacks of adding biochar to soil, and that these feedbacks will be greatest on the least fertile soils, the relative mitigation potentials will vary regionally with soil type (see Supplementary Methods , Supplementary Fig.
S9 and Supplementary Tables S8–S11 for an account of how these feedbacks are calculated).
The distribution of soils of varying fertility on global cropland is shown in Figure 6 .
Globally, 0.31 Gha of soils with no fertility constraints are in use as cropland, as well as 0.29 Gha of cropland with few fertility constraints, 0.21 Gha with slight constraints, 0.32 Gha with moderate constraints, 0.18 Gha with severe constraints, 0.13 Gha with very severe constraints and 0.09 Gha of cropland on soils categorized as unsuitable for crop production.
The amount of biomass produced in soils of different fertilities is shown in Supplementary Table S12 .
Figure 7 shows how the climate mitigation from biochar varies relative to biomass combustion when both soil fertility and the carbon intensity of energy offsets are considered.
The relative benefit of producing biochar compared with biomass combustion is greatest when biochar is added to marginal lands and the energy produced by pyrolysis is used to offset natural gas, renewable or nuclear energy.
When biochar is added to the most infertile cropland to offset the current global primary energy mix (M
), which has a carbon intensity of 16.5 kg C GJ−1, the relative benefit from biochar is as much as 79–64% greater than that from bioenergy ( Fig.
7 , Supplementary Fig.
S10 ).
This net benefit diminishes as more coal is offset and as biochar is added to soils with higher fertility.
Nevertheless, with the exception of those geographical regions having both naturally high soil fertility and good prospects for offsetting coal emissions (in which bioenergy yields up to 16–22% greater mitigation impact than biochar), biochar shows a greater climate-mitigation potential than bioenergy.
The relative benefit of producing biochar compared with bioenergy is greatest when biomass crops are used as feedstocks ( Fig.
7b ), because avoided CH
emissions from the use of manure, green waste and rice residues occur regardless of whether these other feedstocks are used for energy or biochar.

Carbon intensity values for natural gas, oil and coal are also indicated.
The relative mitigation is calculated as cumulative avoided emissions for biochar minus those for bioenergy, expressed as a fraction of the avoided emissions for bioenergy (for example, a value of 0.1 indicates that the cumulative mitigation impact of biochar is 10% greater than that of bioenergy, a value of −0.1 indicates that it is 10% lower and a value of zero indicates that they have the same mitigation impact).

over the course of a century, are possible at current levels of feedstock availability, while preserving biodiversity, ecosystem stability and food security.
The biochar scenarios described here, with their very high levels of biomass utilization, are not compatible with simultaneous implementation of an ambitious biomass energy strategy.
The opportunity cost of this forgone energy resource must be taken into account in an economic comparison of the two strategies.
However, in terms of their potentials for climate-change mitigation, the mitigation impact of biochar is about one-fourth larger, on an average, than that obtained if the same biomass were combusted for energy.
Regional deviations from this average are large because of differences in soil fertility and available biomass.
Our model predicts that the relative climate-mitigation benefit of biochar compared with bioenergy is greatest in regions in which poor soils growing biomass crops can benefit most from biochar additions.
In contrast, biomass combustion leads to a greater climate-mitigation impact in regions with fertile soils where coal combustion can be effectively offset by biomass energy production.
The global climate-mitigation potential achievable from the use of terrestrial biomass may thus be maximized by a mixed strategy favouring bioenergy in those regions with fertile soils where coal emissions can be offset, and biochar elsewhere.
Nevertheless, we have included biochar production in fertile, coal-intensive regions in our scenarios because other potential benefits of biochar, such as its potential for more efficient use of water and crop nutrients 36 , 37 , 38 , may favour its use even in such regions.
We emphasize that the results presented here assume that future biochar production follows strict sustainability criteria.
Land-use changes that incur high carbon debts and biochar production using technologies with poorly controlled emissions lead to both large reductions in avoided emissions and excessively long carbon-payback times, during which net emissions are increased before any net reduction is observed.
Biochar production and use, therefore, must be guided by well-founded and well-enforced sustainability protocols if its potential for mitigating climate change is to be realized.
Biochar can be produced sustainably or unsustainably.
Our criteria for sustainable biochar production require that biomass procured from agricultural and silvicultural residues be extracted at a rate and in a manner that does not cause soil erosion or soil degradation; crop residues currently in use as animal fodder not be used as biochar feedstock; minimal carbon debt be incurred from land-use change or use of feedstocks with a long life expectancy; no new lands be converted into biomass production and no agricultural land be taken out of food production; no biomass wastes that have a high probability of contamination, which would be detrimental to agricultural soils, be used; and biomass crop production be limited to production on abandoned agricultural land that has not subsequently been converted to pasture, forest or other uses.
We further require that biochar be manufactured using modern technology that eliminates soot, CH
O (see Supplementary Table S14 for a summary of estimated global warming potentials for these GHGs).
Although the different atmospheric lifetimes of these gases ensure that there is no equivalence among them in any strict sense, we nevertheless adopt the common practice of normalizing each gas to a 'CO
-C equivalent' using the estimated radiative forcing produced by the emission of each gas, integrated over a 100-year period following emission, using Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 100-year global warming potentials 39 of 23 for CH
The rate at which installed biochar production capacity approaches its maximum is constrained by simple economic considerations.
Data for estimated capital costs are shown in Supplementary Table S15 .
These are implemented in the model using a Gompertz curve ( Supplementary Methods ).
The model allows for a lead time of 5 years, during which little plant capacity is commissioned.
Slow-to-moderate investment for the remainder of the first decade and rapid adoption over the following three decades at a rate of capital investment consistent with the 2% of global gross domestic product that Lord Stern estimates to be required for climate-change mitigation 24 culminate in near-maximal biochar production rates after a total of four decades.
Net avoided GHG emissions over the first decade are negligible, because of a combination of initially slow adoption and carbon-debt payback.

Are this year’s monsoon floods due to global warming?
No single weather event can be attributed to climate change, but a warming climate does load the dice in favor of heavier extreme precipitation events.
This occurs because more water vapor can evaporate into a warmer atmosphere, increasing the chances of record heavy downpours.
In a study published in Science in 2006, Goswami et al.
found that the level of heavy rainfall activity in the monsoon over India had more than doubled in the 50 years since the 1950s, leading to an increased disaster potential from heavy flooding.
Moderate and weak rain events decreased over the past 50 years, leaving the total amount of rain deposited by the monsoon roughly constant.
The authors commented, “These findings are in tune with model projections and some observations that indicate an increase in heavy rain events and a decrease in weak events under global warming scenarios.” We should expect to see an increased number of disastrous monsoon floods in coming decades if the climate continues to warm as expected.
Since the population continues to increase at a rapid rate in the region, death tolls from monsoon flooding disasters are likely to climb dramatically in coming decades.
Dave’s Landslide blog has some great discussions of the flooding and destruction wrought by the terrible monsoon rains this year in Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, and China.
The massive humanitarian crisis in Pakistan requires a huge response by the international community.
Wunderblogger Dr. Ricky Rood, author of our Climate Change Blog, has a friend working in Pakistan who underscored the desperate situation there:
This is the worst natural disaster in the history of Pakistan in terms of number of people and area affected.
Although not as many people have been killed as in the 2005 earthquake, we have already nearly 900,000 displaced persons thus far just in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Crops are destroyed; shops, hotels, and other business have simply been swept away in Swat, which had just this year been cleared of Taliban and was on the way to recovery; and districts closer to Peshawar and parts of Peshawar district are still, or perhaps again after yesterday/today, under water.
After the immediate emergency response, it will be years of rebuilding to replace what has been lost and to start to develop again.
I know you have the power to control the weather, so if you cold give us a week or two without more rain at least we could keep the helicopters flying and give people a chance to go to their homes, recover what might still be there, set up tents if we can get enough to them, and start to clean up.”

By 2050 or so, the world population is expected to reach nine billion, essentially adding two Chinas to the number of people alive today.
Those billions will be seeking food, water and other resources on a planet where, scientists say, humans are already shaping climate and the web of life.
In Dot Earth, which recently moved from the news side of The Times to the Opinion section, Andrew C. Revkin examines efforts to balance human affairs with the planet’s limits.
Conceived in part with support from a John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship, Dot Earth tracks relevant developments from suburbia to Siberia.

Access to cheap energy underpins modern societies.
Finding enough to fuel industrialized economies and pull developing countries out of poverty without overheating the climate is a central challenge of the 21st century.
Human advancement can be aided by curbing everyday losses like the millions of avoidable deaths from indoor smoke and tainted water, and by increasing resilience in the face of predictable calamities like earthquakes and drought.
How are climate change, scarcer resources, population growth and other challenges reshaping society?

With the benefit of hindsight, the firestorm of controversy created by "Climategate" - the illegal release of emails from the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit (CRU) at the end of 2009 - had been brewing for a very long time.
In the highly politicised world of climate science, the accusative chorus of sceptical voices and the increasingly exasperated statements of defence from beleaguered climate scientists had become a deafening cacophony.
Initial media reports talked excitedly of the emails as a "smoking gun" showing climate change to be an elaborate hoax, but these were quickly exposed as completely unfounded.
A House of Commons inquiry in March found no evidence of systematic deception by CRU researchers.
A science panel led by Lord Oxburgh found no evidence of scientific malpractice.
And finally on 7 July, after many months of gathering information, the independent inquiry led by Sir Muir Russell reported its long-awaited findings.
Scientific objectivity goes no further than the circles of expertise that comprise fields of scientific endeavour.
Of course, there are any number of "facts" to be objectively recorded in the natural world through experiment or observation.
In climate science, the facts unambiguously point to the influence of human activity on the climate.
But as the science and environmental journalist David Adam has suggested, the process by which scientists judge each other's work as fit for publication has always been where objective science dashes on the rocks of subjective human opinion.
Short of automating the peer review process, the human fallibility of peer reviewers is simply unavoidable.
Arguments such as these are potent fuel for the fire of sceptical claims that climate science has become a self-regarding consensus machine, fine-tuned to keep out the outliers and reinforce the status quo.
Three inquiries into Climategate have found no evidence that this is the case.
But sceptics have been eager to use the emails as a vehicle for attacking climate science and climate scientists' behaviour nonetheless.
The science journalist Fred Pearce - despite doing an enormous amount of work in challenging the initial media response to Climategate - has repeatedly criticised CRU researchers.
"I think the emails raise questions about conflicts of interest apparently tolerated in science that would surely not be tolerated in most other professions," he said.
In one email, Phil Jones expresses a desire to "keep out" two papers critical of his work from the Fourth Assessment Report of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
The papers were not, in fact, excluded.
But according to Pearce, "Phil Jones seemed to relish the chance to 'go to town' against those questioning his work.
"
There is a movement in science towards publicly accessible data, and the archiving of databases is now common practice in many subjects.
The digitisation of data and the ubiquity of the internet have ushered in a new level of expectation around public access to information - not only in science, but in global society more generally.
Reflecting this, the aftermath of Climategate has seen repeated calls for climate scientists' raw data to be made available to the general public.
The move towards open access is not only reasonable but inevitable.
But for highly politicised areas of science such as climate change, there may be hidden dangers.
"I'm not sure it would solve things in the way people would like," says Evans, "because the data themselves would still need to be analysed in the context of the scientific theories that give them meaning.
"
As with much of the Climategate debate, there is more at stake than climate change data.
Although the perceived integrity of climate science seems to need a shot in the arm, it cannot come at the cost of a functioning scientific community.
"Scientists would spend their whole lives trying to pick apart what other people had done, and the science would just grind to a halt," Collins suggests.
Throwing open complex climate science databases without due caution could amount to sacrificing climate change data on the altar of public opinion.
Faced with dozens of well-publicised and smartly presented pseudo-analyses of climate change data, who other than the climate scientists themselves would be capable of sorting the wheat from the chaff?
But are the legions of bloggers and auditors - often, but not always, ideologically motivated to find fault (real or imagined) with climate science data - really fulfilling the role of citizen scientists?
Alice Bell, a lecturer in science communication at Imperial College London, has argued that successful citizen-science projects work because they offer collaborative relationships between scientists and the public - not an adversarial auditing of data on the assumption that scientists are dishonest.
The bottom line is that open access can never be a panacea for a crisis of institutional trust.
Last week saw the release of three university-led nationally representative surveys on public attitudes towards climate change – two in the US ( 1 , 2 ) and one in the UK .
In line with previous surveys from the last few years, the UK poll shows four consistent findings:
A large majority of people think the climate is changing (78%)
A large majority of people say they are willing to reduce the amount of energy they use in order to tackle climate change (65%)
If this doesn’t sound like the findings you saw reported, or your impression of public attitudes towards climate change, then go and look up the results which are publicly available.
The picture in the US is slightly different, but not drastically so, with large majorities agreeing that climate change is happening and expressing support for developing low-carbon energy infrastructure.
But what about belief in whether humans are causing climate change?
Isn’t that the crucial measure of scepticism?
Intriguingly, given that the public are frequently portrayed as teetering on the brink of abandoning climate change altogether, one of the US polls recorded an increase in the number of people who believe that human activity is changing the climate (the other had no previous survey to compare with, but found that 75% acknowledged human influence on the climate).
True, the number of people who agree that climate change is largely the result of human activity is significantly lower (in the UK and the US) than it was three years ago.
But given the four consistent findings outlined above, the big question has to be ‘so what’?
Even in the BBC poll, at the height of everything-gate, a healthy majority accepted that the climate was changing.
In the very same poll, only 11% reported being any less concerned about the risks of climate change.
The BBC results are completely consistent with the fact that a majority of people are concerned about climate change – anthropogenic or not – and want something done about it.
That significant numbers of people feel confused about whether human influence is responsible for climate change is unsurprising – a great deal of effort has been expended in trying to confuse them.
The parallels between the strategies of the tobacco industry in the 1960s and the tactics of ideologically driven climate sceptics today are now well documented .
The tobacco companies knew that if they could create enough uncertainty around the link between smoking and lung cancer, then people would continue to consume their product.
But as opinion poll after opinion poll comes in, it is starting to look like the link between belief in human-caused climate change and support for low carbon policies is nowhere near as direct.
There is no escaping the fact that there is a major disparity between the level of certainty expressed by climate scientists and by the general public about the basic facts of climate change.
It seems counter-intuitive that people dispute anthropogenic climate change, but are willing to modify their behaviour to prevent it.
It seems bizarre that 73% of the BBC poll respondents who had heard about ‘climategate’ and IPCC glaciers error claimed that their views about climate change had not been altered.
But this is what the polls are telling us.
The merchants of doubt will soon run out of steam – for all the uncertainty they can generate about human impact on the climate, public support for mitigating climate change remains high.
However you look at this it is a sharply relevant question for action on climate change, because primarily of the policy that comes out of the coalition.
It is yet also a basic conundrum of politics to which the climate change challenge more than any other needs forward progress.
We need stronger consensus building, better working together to meet the challenge of climate change and straight up vested interest horse trading - the Old politics - won't do it, the lack of progress from Copenhagen showed that.
Nick Clegg is in the public gaze the embodiment of this so called “new politics” (ahead of David Laws still yet as things stand!
) and his fate will probably reveal whether May has seen begun a genuinely new phase of progressive politics.
And there are 2 persons whose fortunes may reveal how positive or not this new political context will be for action on climate change.
Lib Dem Chris Huhne the new energy and climate change secretary was one of David Cameron's first coalition ministers to venture into the news agenda.
He told us "There are a whole series of compromises which have been struck in this agreement which I think are obviously unpleasant for each of the parties"
A refreshingly honest characterisation of cabinet and coalition politics you could say.
He expressed these sentiments in the context of his explanation of the coalition policy on Nuclear power; New nuclear power stations will be built if they are funded by the private sector and Lib Dems can continue to hold to their election manifesto position of disagreeing with nuclear power generation.
Huhne reconciles himself to this policy by speaking loud the belief that the private sector hasn't and probably won’t be able to build nuclear without state support - refreshing or regressive change?
Ed Miliband Labour ex energy and climate change minister came up with the memorable line Huhne in his job was like “putting a vegan in charge of MacDonald’s.”
, delegates at the Washington Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species voted against a ban on fishing bluefin tuna.
The decision was widely condemned by environmental groups, and in The Guardian, George Monbiot described the refusal to acknowledge the critically endangered state of the bluefin tuna as:
‘ Bottomfeeder ’, by Taras Grescoe is a book about the overfishing and ultimate demise of many of the world’s fisheries.
Combining barely-believable statistics about the collapse of once abundant oceanic ecosystems (some estimates put European fish populations at 5% of their first-recorded levels) and interviews with countless fishermen and traders in ports and harbours around the world, Grescoe builds up a bewildering picture of the world’s seas.
While the evidence is anecdotal rather than statistical, it is striking just how many of the fishermen (and it is primarily men) that Grescoe speaks to are adamant that climate change is warming their seas and driving away their catch.
Their intuition that the seas are warming is supported by sea temperature data – but by far and away the biggest impact on the number of fish they are pulling out of the sea is intensive overfishing.
Far fewer of Grescoe’s interviewees acknowledge this – blaming seals, foreigners, and global warming before conceding that perhaps their methods of fishing might be having an effect.
So, notorious Guardian message board climate denier CheshireRed solemnly supports the protestors who seek to prevent overfishing of the bluefin tuna, and accepts that those who are responsible for the overfishing are in denial about the cause of the problem – but does not support measures to curb greenhouse gases which would (presumably) impact on his behaviour.
Conversely, the fishermen responsible for overfishing happily accept climate change but doubt that their actions have any impact on the state of the world’s fisheries.
I’m going to go out on a limb and guess that CheshireRed (and his message board buddies) are not sea fishermen, with a vested interest in underplaying the impact of overfishing.
However, like most of us in the developed world they have a personal stake in climate change being shown to be a scam – it would eliminate the need to change our high-consuming lifestyles.
Some people – for economic or ideological reasons – have a more formal desire to reject the science of climate change.
Perhaps we need to start asking some more subtle questions about belief in climate change.
Combating the increasing level of climate change scepticism is high on most campaigners’ priority lists.
But without a sensible grasp of the reasons for scepticism, an awful lot of effort could be expended without any discernible effect.
We urgently need a typology of scepticism.
Confronted with a problem like climate change, our consumption-based economy responds in the only way it knows how – by selling sustainability like it sells soap.
But while a desire to be "seen to be green" clearly leaves us vulnerable to the dubious motives of commercial marketing campaigns (not to mention some ribbing down the pub), harnessing the primal urge for social status is critical for promoting pro-environmental behaviours that are more substance than spin.
We may currently compete through demonstrations of conspicuous material consumption, but material goods are simply a marker for social status.
It's the social status that's important – and the markers we use to signify it can easily change.
Earlier this year the Centre for Research on Environmental Decisions at Columbia University published a guide to The Psychology of Climate Change Communication .
My favourite bit is a table of 'words with different meanings to scientists and the general public'.
Here are some of them (science term first, followed by non-science interpretation):
While this is probably something of a caricature of how people interpret these words, there's an important message in here for climate change communication - don't assume that people interpret specialist terminology in the same way you do!
On August 1st, 2008, the New Economics Foundation issued a report stating that there are 100 months in which to set in motion policies that will prevent 'dangerous' climate change.
100 months...and counting.
George Marshall seeks to understand the psychology of people who deny the existence of climate change- and finds some very common and very human failings.
Most disturbing of all, 60% of people believe that “many scientific experts still question if humans are contributing to climate change”.
Thirty per cent of people believe climate change is “largely down to natural causes”, while 7% refuse to accept the climate is changing at all .
None of this bodes well for a rational approach to climate change .
Climate change is invariably presented as an overwhelming threat requiring unprecedented restraint, sacrifice, and government intervention.
The metaphors it invokes are poisonous to people who feel rewarded by free market capitalism and distrust government interference.
It is hardly surprising that political world view is by far the greatest determinant of attitudes to climate change, especially in the US where three times more Republicans than Democrats believe that “too much fuss is made about global warming” .
An intuitive suspicion is then reinforced by a deep distrust of the key messengers: the liberal media, politicians and green campaign groups.
As Jeremy Clarkson says, bundling them all together: “…everything we’ve been told for the past five years by the government, Al Gore , Channel 4 News and hippies everywhere is a big bucket of nonsense.” Michael O’Leary , the founder of Ryanair, likens “hairy dungaree and sandal wearing climate change alarmists” to “the CND nutters of the 1970s” .
These cultural prejudices, however simplistic, align belief with cultural allegiance: “People like us,” they say, “do not believe in this tripe.”
However much one distrusts environmentalists, it is harder to discount the scientists… depending, of course, on which scientists one listens to.
The conservative news media, continues to provide a platform for the handful of scientists who reject the scientific consensus.
Of the 18 experts that appeared in Channel 4′s notorious sceptic documentary The Great Global Warming Swindle, 11 have been quoted in the past two years in the Daily and Sunday Telegraph, five of them more than five times.
Dr Myanna Lahsen, a cultural anthropologist at the University of Colorado, has specialised in understanding how professional scientists, some of them with highly respected careers, turn climate sceptic .
She found the largest common factor was a shared sense that they had personally lost prestige and authority as the result of campaigns by liberals and environmentalists.
She concluded that their engagement in climate issues “can be understood in part as a struggle to preserve their particular culturally charged understanding of environmental reality.”
This individualistic romantic image is nurtured by the libertarian right think tanks that promote the sceptic arguments.
One academic study of 192 sceptic books and reports found that 92% were directly associated with right wing free market think tanks .
It concluded that the denial of climate change had been deliberately constructed “as a tactic of an elite-driven counter-movement designed to combat environmentalism”.
So, given that scepticism is rooted in a sustained and well-funded ideological movement, how can sceptics be swayed?
One way is to reframe climate change in a way that rejects the green cliches and creates new metaphors with a wider resonance .
So out with the polar bears and saving the planet.
Instead let’s talk of energy independence, and the potential for new enterprise.
And then there is peer pressure, probably the most important influence of all.
So, when dealing with a sceptic, don’t get into a head to head with them.
Just politely point out all the people they know and respect who believe that climate change is a serious problem — and they aren’t sandle-wearing tree huggers, are they?
Having said ‘out with the polar bears’, the Guardian brilliantly headed it with a stock photo of a polar bear in a little scrap of ice.
What is rather more interesting are the comments that follow which are mostly text book examples of the various denial strategies we know only too well:
“Even from the point of view of someone who believes in the global warming mass hysteria, it is obviously sensible to see that its a global problem and not local (who In Britain would regret a bit of warming?
) that its obviously future, because its not happening now”
“consensus of every major scientific institution” does not equal “fact”.
..How is it possible that a planetary body that has endured ice ages, meteor strikes, volcanic eruptions, etc can be said to be under threat by a puny species like humankind?”
Very interesting, George.
I read George Lakoff’s book latest book at the end of last year and (the bits I understood!
) – he has some profound insights.
He makes a strong case that we should think about clusters of beliefs, which is very relevant about how we think about climate change and the low-carbon economy.
A. Beautiful nature – doing “good for the environment” means helping to save things threatened by climate change.
Please imagine ice caps, coral reefs, wildlife, mountain shots, waterfalls, beaches, birds and earth from space.
I stumbled across your blog looking for climate related blogs.
I just started a blog, which in part, addresses global warming.
I was very intrigued by your post.
Especially since I am one of those “deniers”.
Very interesting, I must say.
I’m not responding to bash you or explain myself for thinking the way I think.
It amazes me how much passion there is on both sides of the issue.
I really try to keep the passion and zeal to a minimum.
I read a lot on the subject and just try to be informed.
Ultimately I came to the conclusion that man-made global warming doesn’t add up.
I don’t expect to change your point of view and you will not change mine.
But there are some of us “deniers” that have no hidden agenda and don’t view this as a left-right issue.
It is an extremely important issue because of what the government would like to do in the name of climate change.
I’m sorry to say but that scares me very much.
As with human psychology in general, I think there are a lot of things going on.
I agree with the idea that a shared sense of being attacked can be one of them.
One thing that I’ve encountered among otherwise apparently rational people, is the idea that if the explanations given by the scientific consensus are not “obvious” (however that’s defined by the individual), or contradicts what appears to be obvious to them, then they’re NOT going to buy in.
This is understandable to a large degree, because in many cases the resolution of particular issues in daily life is fairly obvious; evolution has given us the ability to make the necessary quick (and accurate) judgments and act accordingly.
But with big, hairy complex topics operating at very large scales beyond what our experience gives us the skill to discern well, uncertainty as to cause and effect necessarily arises.
We are simply not equipped to make the call on such topics, and large scale, systematized knowledge acquisition–well beyond the abilities of any individual–is necessary to do so.
When that uncertainty arises, all hell breaks loose in a lot of people.
They don’t know how to handle it, it’s not in their tool kit.
Some find it incredibly disconcerting that “common sense” explanations may not be correct.
And indeed, that is troubling–if we can’t trust our own observations, senses, intuitions–that’s really a very serious problem.
We have to deny that as a possibility, for sake of our sanity and ability to act in the world.
Others realize, that hey, whatever, we’re just human, we can’t be expected to correctly evaluate super complex topics without serious cooperative enterprises (i.e.
science). Even among scientists this “common sense” issue can arise, because scientists in different areas use very different tools and assumptions.
If you’re not familiar with stochasticity, signal to noise ratios and other fundamental concepts in complex science, you’re less likely to buy in.
I once worked in molecular biology and I guarantee that most of those people have little clue about such things.
A lot of engineers as well–they expect exact and tidy answers.
Most ecologists on the other hand, have no problem with climate change science, because they’re used to multivariate, noisy processes.
Another big one, which you touch on, is the difference in deeply held value systems.
Frankly, a lot of people just don’t CARE about things that seem too remote from their day to day existence and unconnected from their values.
The sad fact is that there’s a LOT of people, at least in the U.S., who are +/- completely disconnected from the natural world.
It’s not important, it doesn’t figure into their daily concerns because it appears to have no bearing on such.
I once roomed with a guy from a large family farm who said someone once told him “We don’t really need farmers, we could just eat canned goods if we had to”.
To many people, food comes from the supermarket, gas from the gas station, everything else from the mall, and weather only matters if it alters their travel plans.
Think the average corporate person, much less the ones near the top of the ladder, gives a damn about climate, agriculture or ecology?
?
Others don’t have the energy to care about such things–they’re too busy taking care of themselves and those close to them.
The global climate, 100 years from now???
As if!!
How about their kid’s college tuition or a higher paying job.
I can understand your idea that we should appeal to the ideas that resonate with the audience instead of those that alienate.
OK, to some degree if that’ll help.
But if that involves the acquiescence of OUR value systems, sorry.
I’m one of those sandal-wearing hippies, who also happens to be a scientist, that believes in the sanctity of the biosphere and I put that value way ahead of things like “energy independence” or “economic growth”.
You econ-heads want energy independence, fine, good idea all around.
You want to disparage my world view, fuck off, I’ll fight for what I value, not what you do.
I’ve just been led to your site by an interesting critical article at Climate-Resistance.
In your postscript you cite some comments to your Guardian article which you describe as “text book examples of the various denial strategies we know only too well”.
My intemperate comparison stemmed from the fact that I disapprove strongly of the whole tenor of your article, which suggests that scepticism over catastrophic anthropogenic global warming is some form of mental aberration akin to denial of evolution by religious fundamentalists.
As long as science is a process of open-minded enquiry; as long as climate science is an ongoing process and not a corpus of established truth; and, above all, as long as the future hasn’t happened yet; scepticism is a valid, justifiable position.
Refuse to debate with us if you like; the world will go on without you.
Fear trumps common sense just about every time ….this is why the pros on the Climate skeptic Business side constantly use the term ‘Alarmist ‘ in all their papers and blog entries ….they do this and have done this sort of thing in one way or another for many thousands of years because it Works so well.
If you think CO2 does not cause climate change in any way, shape or form , then you are assuredly not well informed.
If you think one lone genius has it all figured out when the rest of the scientific community have deceived themselves, then I have no problem labeling you a denier.
Nor, I suspect, are you receptive to “further discussion.”
A friend of mine recently said, “I can say truthfully that the conclusions that Al Gore and the IPCC have arrived at are based on some awfully shaky data.
Climate is always changing.
Would it shock Gore to know that during the greatest explosion of biodiversity ever recorded, 530 million years ago, carbon dioxide levels were 5000-7000 ppm, as opposed to 385 ppm today?
That oxygen levels were half of what they are today?
That during the Cretaceous period, when dinosaurs were tromping around, CO2 levels were 1800 ppm, and glaciers were oscillating with periods of time when the average global temp was 30 degrees C?
That right now sea level is about as low as it can be without being in an ice age?
The only way for them to go is up.
It drives me nuts!
We see a little climate change that is an order of magnitude smaller than what has happened in the past, and we automatically assume that it’s our fault!
Species right now are going extinct fast not because of climate change, but because we keep chopping down habitat.
Sea level is rising because we are coming out of an ice age.
Over 80% of the history of the Earth is ice-free.
No glaciers anywhere.
Sure we are messing up the ecosystem.
But we are not causing large-scale alterations in weather patterns.
No way.
The episodic oscillations in the output of the sun matched the climate record way better than co2 levels.
Google reports in the late 60′s and early 70′s about the great New Ice Age scare, when the Earth started cooling down, all while CO2 levels were going up.
It boggles my mind how self-respecting scientists can say that their computer climate models say that we are to blame, when those models can’t reproduce the Little Ice Age of the 1500′s, or the cooling trend a few decades ago, or the Younger Dryas period, or the Holocene Maximum.”
[George writes- I do not usually accept comments from people arguing against the science- this site is to discuss responses to climate change, not its existence, but this is more thoughtful and open minded than usual]
Here is how you could convince me to support you all.
First, acknowledge that other factors create climate change more than man made gases.
The impact from sunspots etc may also be more predictable, so change could be demonstrable.
Then start addressing how to deal with the changes, rather than wasting energy on preventing it.
Seriously, if you all really truly believe all of this imminent doom and gloom, why wouldn’t you focus on preparing to cope with the results now?
As long as you yourselves are not focused on that as your top priority, nobody is going to believe it is even that much of a concern for you yourselves.
And all of the time and energy you spend telling each other how stupid or ignorant deniers are seems completely pointless, you should stop that too – leaders lead, they don’t whine about why people are not following them.
Do you also explore the psychology of people who have become “believers” in climate change and refuse to admit even the possibility that it is a legitimate pursuit of science to question prevailing views with new data and ideas.
If you refuse to admit that you may be wrong then you can no longer say you are advocating a scientific view.
Like some of your other readers, I’m here looking at any information I can find on Climate.
I’m more than sceptical about any catastrophic climate change induced by man’s use of fossil fuels.
It has nothing to do with emotion or mindset.
I’m a physicist.
C02 is clearly a greenhouse gas, and most sceptics understand this.
But at 380ppm, they realize it hasn’t the heat capacity to drive a catastrophic change, and indeed, the IPCCs favored climate models realize this also, looking instead to water vapor for the feedback that would cause a meaningful temperature change.
Our own government monitors polar ice extent with satellites, and when I see that Antarctica has been accumulating ice according to their calculations, and again, according to their calculations, at a much greater rate than losses in the arctic, one has to wonder where the water will come from to cause catastrophic rise in ocean levels.
Here in recent weeks, the arctic has ice within one standard deviation of the 1979-2000 mean.
Yes, of course I expect this new ice will most likely decline below the mean this summer.
But since I’m expecting a cyclical behavior, my suspicion is we’re on a cooling trend that will last for another 20 years or more.
When this ice information comes direct from the NSIDC, I find it very credible.
Short of sending up my own satellite, I’m not sure how I would validate their findings.
But I do believe oil companies have no hand in this information.
So my contribution to your question of what makes a sceptic is: It’s the data.
The failure of ice to melt (consistently), the failure of temperature to rise (without falling back periodically) If the current period of cooling, which, by the way, was NOT predicted by the GCMs, continues in tandem with weakened solar cycles (expected for SC24 and SC25), one can only conclude that if Solar variability (however yet misunderstood) or any other forcings, can drive global average temperatures lower, we must also accept they can drive those temperatures higher, and we just need to understand the mechanism by which they do this.
It was wholly appropriate to question if man’s massive contribution to C02 could have a harmful effect.
We have learned that C02 is a factor, and I’m grateful for the warmth it provides, but it doesn’t validate as the primary factor, or as yet, as a validated risk to mankind.
You’d be interested to know that at least one of the scientists in the Global Warming Swindle “documentary” has claimed that he was swindled and mislead about the purpose of the documentary and regrets being apart of the project.
see http://www.medialens.org/alerts/07/0313pure_propaganda_the.php
Steve says that climate change is “an extremely important issue because of what the government would like to do in the name of climate change.
I’m sorry to say but that scares me very much”.
I think FEAR is the underlying reason that Steve is prepared to dismiss the consensus among the scientists of all major scientific institutions on climate change.
It is clear that our world is going to change very substantially in the next few decades, whether because of climate change directly, or because of the action that will be taken to prevent it.
On this basis, it is a pointless waste of energy to indulge in fear – yet the automatic reaction to fear is to fight (a commonly chosen behaviour of those who will not accept the reality of climate change).
There is a deep seated irrationality in right wing political movements, whether Italy during the 1930′s or the U.S. today. We are probably naive if we think that scientific investigation and findings by world class scientists is going to change the minds of those with a political worldview.
Many on the Right are suspicious of any efforts to ameliorate climate problems, seeing the dark hand of international institutions, supranational elites, and the concomitant loss of U.S. sovereignty. You know, the “U.N.
has black helicopters” crew.
Of course the media, like Fox News helps to perpetuate climate change denial.
Plug in “global warming” into their website and you come up with links to the nonsensical junk science website, which is run by an individual who is not even a scientist.
But as China continues to destroy the climate, I think it was 6 billion tons of carbon dioxide they pumped into the atmosphere last year, the Right may suddenly see the light.
This blog explores the topic of the psychology of climate change denial - with observations and anecdotes about our weird and disturbed response to the problem.
It seeks to answer a question that has puzzled me for years: why, when the evidence is so strong, and so many agree that this is our greatest problem, are we doing so little about climate change?
My name is George Marshall- I am the founder of a climate change charity, the Climate Outreach Information Network .
Watching it I can only conclude that architects exhibit a particularly interesting and complex form of denial.
Architects are, in my experience, aware people with progressive politics.
As a profession they have a huge responsibility for causing climate change (the energy consumed by buildings and their materials are the single largest source of greenhouse gases) and a huge opportunity to develop the forms and structures of a low carbon economy.
And, to be fair, they do talk about climate change a fair bit in magazines and conferences and books.
But the people at the top of the profession who get the Stirling and Pritzker prizers and the Gold medals and the gongs and the big fancy projects are not building anything that remotely reflects the realities of climate change.
Take concrete for example.
Cement has horrible CO2 emissions- very high temperatures are needed to slake the lime which produces yet more carbon dioxide as a by product.
Cement manufacture accounts for 5% of the worlds greenhouse gas emissions.
If we were serious about climate change it would be used very sparingly indeed.
And yet the bookies favourite to win the Stirling prize was Zaha Hadid’s extraordinary Phaeno Science Centre.
It is is a symphony in ‘compacted concrete’ – the concrete floors sweeping up and around the museum to create one organic whole.
It creates a thrilling new language for concrete that will be imitated widely.
But it pays a high price.
It used 27,000 cubic metres of concrete which produced nearly 10,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide.
Given that a sustainable level is probably not much more than one tonne of carbon dioxide per person per year, that is a huge footprint.
The winner of the Stirling Prize is Richard Rogers’ Barajas Airport.
An airport wins the prize!
A parking garage for the fastest growing cause of climate change!
The top architects probably spend half their lives in airports and are especially subject to the near universal denial about the impacts of flights.
Yet, if we are going to deal with climate change this building type needs to become as obselete as the bear pit.
One reason that people don’t see planes as polluting is that it doesn’t feel dirty.
There are no smokestacks or piles of coal.
Planes feel (and feelings count more than reality when we assess impacts) very smart and white and clean.
Rogers and his team have concentrated their creativity on creating an airport that extends that feeling- all open and bright and fresh.
But the openness and brightness of the interiors is made possible by large expanses of plate glass (and a lot of steel to hold it up).
What we don’t see in the pictures is the huge cooling and heating plant which keeps it at a tolerable temperature.
No doubt Rogers, who speaks often about climate change (his shortlisted Welsh Assembly building appears to have made a serious attempt to be green), has achieved a very high energy design by using lots of clever technology and design to keep the energy load manageable.
And one could expand on this point endlessly.
All around the world the best and most creative architects are using new technologies to push the expressive potential of their buildings.
Gehry faces his buildings with sheets or stainless steel and titanium (the most energy intensive metal of all).
Rem Koolhaas has built a new library in Seattle with entirely glass walls and roof.
Work was suspended on Herzog and de Meuron ‘s Olympic stadium in Beijing because of the costs of the 80,000 tonnes of steel involved in its construction.
That’s 152,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide- an incredible indulgence…and so I could go on.
None of these designs are models for a sustainable future.
All the architects have won the Pritzer award- the highest award for architecture.
As you can tell, I love architecture but despair of what is being done with it.
Modernism arose from an entirely valid critique that traditional building was not able to meet the needs and opportunities of the modern world.
In fifty years time, as the seas are rising and the hurricanes are crashing every month into Florida these buildings will appear pathetically dated- the last decadent rococo flourish of the carbon age.
So why, when all the scientists agree on the problem, are they still be built and lauded?
This is an interesting commentary on current society.
However, society–and humanity–always lags behind reality.
People only respond to a crisis when they are already deeply into it; September 11 and Pearl Harbor are prime examples.
The human race will not react to Global Warming and its dire consequences until a similarly devastating even occurs (I imagine it to be the West Antarctic ice fields sliding off into the sea), so it is no surprise that the world of architectural design would pay no attention to the next era’s ethos.
What I really cant get my head around is how deeply out of touch the people who are commissioning this building must be.
I can understand that they have absolutely no understanding of the deep environmental crisis we are facing.
They must know nothing about Climate Change (2) or issues of Peak Oil and energy security (3) but a randomly piled series of glass boxes for an Art Gallery ?
Where do they hang the pictures ?
Where are the centuries of wisdom on how to perfectly design an art gallery –Kettles Yard in Cambridge with the soft top light showing the pictures to perfection, the Clore Gallery, and all the other wonderful spaces for hanging pictures !
Oh yes and then there is the little fact that the extraordinarily high energy consumption in it will produce huge amounts of the CO2 that is driving the climate change that will cause the heat waves ….
Did no one tell Sir Nicholas ?
Does the project suffer from the ‘Beautiful’ syndrome?
Why did the engineers not say ‘this is a deeply not very clever idea?’.
My recent plenary talk at the American Solar Energy Society conference was on the subject of ‘Adaptation’ (4).
The thesis there was that it is probably too late to concentrate just on mitigation programmes for climate change and we urgently need to address the challenge of how to Adapt our buildings to enable us to survive through the coming difficult decades of the 21st century.
(2) For extensive and authoritative information on climate change and it s impacts see: http://www.ukcip.org.uk and http://www.ipcc.ch
There are a very few of us promoting social and environmental responsibility (which is how I met my first wife), and I did a PhD in the area of Community Design in housing.
There is an exceptional organisation called Architects and Engineers for Social Responsibility, that actually sent a delegate to the Climate and Energy UNED-UK working group in the run-up to the 2002 UN World Summit.
I went to a recent lecture by Zaha Hadid at the AA School of Architecture, and was shocked that all the students around me were totally enraptured over what she was saying about her grossly profligate use of concrete, and no one of any age questioned her about environmental impacts at all (I was in a basement overflow room).
Yes, it is galling to witness such blinkered creativity of those who are at the pinnacle of creating and shaping the cathedrals of architecture of our time.
But I feel sure that with the rapid groundswell of recognition for the need for sustainable living that seems to be marching ahead at such a great pace, so will the cathedrals of our future start to address environmental impact as well as aesthetic considerations.
But I doubt such a shift will come from those who are already well established and set in their ways – rather I think there will be two major driving forces of change.
The first, in the short-term, from a general shaping of informed understanding, and secondly, in the longer-term, sheer necessity by dint of more extreme climate change conditions.
The door of necessity is closing rapidly on us.
Although I doubt WW2 rationing was held back for ‘right to choice’, I can hear the words spoken today ….
“The thing is Prime Minister, we think we should give people the right to choose…” Choose what?
Polluting and unsustainable practices?
Environmental damage?
The ability to survive when oil prices go through the roof?
The problem with presenting choice is it implies knowledge of the alternatives – and acceptance that the each option proffered is an acceptable choice.
The whole issue is enormously complex and there is in my view a lot of smoke and mirrors.
It is almost impossible to support one argument as there is always a valid counter.
In my view sensible low tech site responsive solutions are the answer.
People understand how to live in the space and they don’t break as often.
This blog explores the topic of the psychology of climate change denial - with observations and anecdotes about our weird and disturbed response to the problem.
It seeks to answer a question that has puzzled me for years: why, when the evidence is so strong, and so many agree that this is our greatest problem, are we doing so little about climate change?
My name is George Marshall- I am the founder of a climate change charity, the Climate Outreach Information Network .
When I first started working on climate change at an environmental policy unit at Oxford University in 1992, a joke said to be doing the rounds among senior business executives was that if we were all going down on the Titanic one might as well go first class.
“Like a string of pearls… made up of hundreds of tiny islands, [these] are many people’s idea of the perfect tropical paradise: white-sand beaches, palm trees and a handful of tasteful, luxury resorts where wooden bungalows perch on stilts over the cobalt blue sea.
But they are also poised on the brink of extinction…At a time of rising seas, melting ice caps and increasing storms, experts warn a large number of islands are likely to become submerged in the next two decades.”
All this can be yours…for seven nights from £1,380 ($2,740) per person, room only, including flights and transfers.
But don’t worry about the environmental impact of flying, says article co-author Joanne O’Connor: “Tourism has proved itself to be a powerful tool for encouraging local populations to protect their natural resources…[and] Ripping up our passports and vowing never to fly again will not solve the problem of global warming.”
Further, there are far too many poor people in the world dependent on primary resources such as reefs and forests ever to be reached by eco-tourists.
This great majority will not receive the benefit of eco-tourist dollars but will suffer the impact of the tourists’ pollution.
Very often eco-tourism is a stalking horse mass tourism, which is hugely destructive of the environment in both the short and long run.
If you are genuinely concerned about the welfare of those who you think would benefit from eco-tourism don’t fly there for pleasure.
Instead, send your money to a responsible, locally based and owned organization that helps people build more sustainable livelihoods for themselves.
The disproportionately large damage of aviation to the atmosphere is abundantly documented and reported, not least by The Guardian/Observer.
So don’t give me this codswallop.
Take coral reefs, in which I have a particular interest.
Climate change is far from being the only threat to them.
In the Philippines, for example, around 95% have been destroyed by destructive fishing practices.
That said, there is abundant evidence that reefs are the most vulnerable global ecosystem to anthropogenic climate change.
Some scientists are predicting, for example, that “bleaching” (due to heat stress, and potentially very damaging to corals) could soon be a yearly event on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef .
Already last February a company in Australia was reportedly marketing tours to the ghost reef .
In a way the object of your anger has grown into an entire exhibition of nice, beautiful places that are about to disappear from climate change; see 100places.com – not exactly travel journalism though.
But the Maldives is their spot no 57.
I also blogged a bit about these picturesque places of death at climatechange.thinkaboutit.eu !

My name is George Marshall- I am the founder of a climate change charity, the Climate Outreach Information Network .
It is time for another selection of images from advertising and newsmedia that respond to climate change in a bizarre and dissonant manner.
Many thanks to the denial bloggers who contributed.
Here’s a cracker for a starter.
It’s the front cover of Wallpaper, a design magazine for the bling encrusted show-off international rich with feature articles on which airports have the most glamourous first class lounges.
I have to admit that I am a subscriber- but then I’m sick.Wallpaper themed its November issue around climate change with this bizarre image.
Post modern s eating for King Canute?
This new Play Station game ‘Need for Speed CARBON’ came out a few months ago.
I suspect the word ‘Carbon’ was chosen with the same ‘climate change is for sissies’ mentality that we’ve noticed before in ads (see november posting)- after all, would a car racing game ever use the word carbon if we not hearing so much about climate change?
I can imagine in this case that it is also aiming to add a sense of living on the edge Mad Max apocalypse to their wretched game.
However, is was easy to get a picture of this bumber sticker because it was a freebie that fell out of my Saturday Guardian.
The Guardian newspaper has been on the forefront of serious reporting on climate change and , despite the cynical decision to carry excerpts from Bjorn Lomborg some years back, they’ve been pretty good,.
So what to make of this free giveaway sticker?
Certainly it does not read to me like a positive message that the driver is driving as little as possible to save the climate.
The whole tone and phrasing seems to be saying ‘piss off with your nagging climate change whingeing- I’m the one to make the decisions about when and where to drive my car’.
As such, intentional or otherwise, it certainly qualifies for the undercurrent of reactive climate change denial mentioned in the ADS 4 LADS posting
Peter writes ‘this advert is less obvious than the car adverts, but, for me, just as disturbing as they are using powerful family brand values to promote a key culprit for causing global warming.
(How about images of dying coral, species loss, bush fires, people starving from desert encroachment etc etc.instead!!)’.
On the desert encroachments I would add that burning this much coal produced 360,000 tons of carbon dioxide.
That’s twenty times more than the entire annual emissions of Somalia.
And they’re the ones who are going to starve as a result.
Chris Petit sent me this advert from Shell which appeared in 14th October 2006 edition of ‘The Week’ which he says he spotted in his girlfriends bathroom – presumably during a meditative reading break.
I have cropped the image and cut off text about how creative and hard working ‘John’ has to be to squeeze the last toxic fossil fuels out of the ground.
Chris says ‘ It’s their blatant posturing that appears to say ‘hey, we know the world’s resources are running low, but don’t worry we have heroes like this guy working for us to source even the hardest to reach reserves.
So don’t worry your little minds about things running out, there’s still plenty of natural resources out there to be had, so keep on living your unsustainable lifestyles and keep on consuming, it is OK.’ It really saddens me.
Finally thank you Chris Smith and Mark Gater who both wrote to remind me of the disgraceful adverts produced by the Exxon and Texaco funded Competitive Enterprise Insitute with the strapline “Carbon Dioxide: they call it pollution, we call it life”.
It is not exactly denial so much as unspeakable cynical manipulation.
adverts that reveal some aberrant response to climate change (including outrageous greenwash).
Please send scans to george@coinet.org.uk or snail mail me a hard copy c/o COIN, 16B Cherwell Street, Oxford OX4 1BG, UK and I will scan it for you.
But don’t you worry about that!
I’m sure Shell have some heroic guys working right now on finding new rivers for us to pollute and abuse…somewhere…
When it comes to Playstation, the use of the word carbon has nothing at all to do with climate change – I think that only someone who is completely and utterly obssessed with CO2 emissions could possibly think that.
This blog explores the topic of the psychology of climate change denial - with observations and anecdotes about our weird and disturbed response to the problem.
It seeks to answer a question that has puzzled me for years: why, when the evidence is so strong, and so many agree that this is our greatest problem, are we doing so little about climate change?
My name is George Marshall- I am the founder of a climate change charity, the Climate Outreach Information Network .
George Marshall seeks to understand the psychology of people who deny the existence of climate change- and finds some very common and very human failings.
Most disturbing of all, 60% of people believe that “many scientific experts still question if humans are contributing to climate change”.
Thirty per cent of people believe climate change is “largely down to natural causes”, while 7% refuse to accept the climate is changing at all .
None of this bodes well for a rational approach to climate change .
Climate change is invariably presented as an overwhelming threat requiring unprecedented restraint, sacrifice, and government intervention.
The metaphors it invokes are poisonous to people who feel rewarded by free market capitalism and distrust government interference.
It is hardly surprising that political world view is by far the greatest determinant of attitudes to climate change, especially in the US where three times more Republicans than Democrats believe that “too much fuss is made about global warming” .
An intuitive suspicion is then reinforced by a deep distrust of the key messengers: the liberal media, politicians and green campaign groups.
As Jeremy Clarkson says, bundling them all together: “…everything we’ve been told for the past five years by the government, Al Gore , Channel 4 News and hippies everywhere is a big bucket of nonsense.” Michael O’Leary , the founder of Ryanair, likens “hairy dungaree and sandal wearing climate change alarmists” to “the CND nutters of the 1970s” .
These cultural prejudices, however simplistic, align belief with cultural allegiance: “People like us,” they say, “do not believe in this tripe.”
However much one distrusts environmentalists, it is harder to discount the scientists… depending, of course, on which scientists one listens to.
The conservative news media, continues to provide a platform for the handful of scientists who reject the scientific consensus.
Of the 18 experts that appeared in Channel 4′s notorious sceptic documentary The Great Global Warming Swindle, 11 have been quoted in the past two years in the Daily and Sunday Telegraph, five of them more than five times.
Dr Myanna Lahsen, a cultural anthropologist at the University of Colorado, has specialised in understanding how professional scientists, some of them with highly respected careers, turn climate sceptic .
She found the largest common factor was a shared sense that they had personally lost prestige and authority as the result of campaigns by liberals and environmentalists.
She concluded that their engagement in climate issues “can be understood in part as a struggle to preserve their particular culturally charged understanding of environmental reality.”
This individualistic romantic image is nurtured by the libertarian right think tanks that promote the sceptic arguments.
One academic study of 192 sceptic books and reports found that 92% were directly associated with right wing free market think tanks .
It concluded that the denial of climate change had been deliberately constructed “as a tactic of an elite-driven counter-movement designed to combat environmentalism”.
So, given that scepticism is rooted in a sustained and well-funded ideological movement, how can sceptics be swayed?
One way is to reframe climate change in a way that rejects the green cliches and creates new metaphors with a wider resonance .
So out with the polar bears and saving the planet.
Instead let’s talk of energy independence, and the potential for new enterprise.
And then there is peer pressure, probably the most important influence of all.
So, when dealing with a sceptic, don’t get into a head to head with them.
Just politely point out all the people they know and respect who believe that climate change is a serious problem — and they aren’t sandle-wearing tree huggers, are they?
Having said ‘out with the polar bears’, the Guardian brilliantly headed it with a stock photo of a polar bear in a little scrap of ice.
What is rather more interesting are the comments that follow which are mostly text book examples of the various denial strategies we know only too well:
“Even from the point of view of someone who believes in the global warming mass hysteria, it is obviously sensible to see that its a global problem and not local (who In Britain would regret a bit of warming?
) that its obviously future, because its not happening now”
“consensus of every major scientific institution” does not equal “fact”.
..How is it possible that a planetary body that has endured ice ages, meteor strikes, volcanic eruptions, etc can be said to be under threat by a puny species like humankind?”

Plastic bags - shocking statistics!
Five trillion plastic bags are maunfactured globally each year.
It takes around 1,000 years for a plastic bag to break down.
In the process, toxic substances leak into the soil and enter the food chain.
Approximately 1 billion seabirds and mammals die each year by ingesting plastic bags (source: Say No To Plastic Bags).
Tropical rainforests took up to 100 million years to evolve and are believed to be the oldest and most complex land-based ecosystem on earth, containing over 30 million species of plants and animals.
That's half of the Earth's wildlife and at least two-thirds of its plant species!
Meat and climate change Links between meat eating and climate change have been widely known for many years, partly due to deforestation in the Amazon rainforest to make room for cattle grazing.
Clearing these forests is estimated to produce a staggering 17% of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than the entire transport sector!
Water: The source of all life About 70% of the earth’s surface is covered with water and 97% of this is salt water.
Although the salt can be removed (desalination), it is a difficult and expensive process.
2% of the water on earth is glacier ice at the North and South Poles while less than 1% of all the water on earth is fresh water that we can actually use.

Polar bears face 'tipping point' due to climate change The journal Biological Conservation has published research which suggests that polar bears face a ‘tipping point’ due to climate change.
The research claims that there will be a dramatic and sudden decline in the number of polar bears, due in the main to falling pregnancy rates and fewer bears surviving during longer, ice-free seasons.

"The issue of climate change is one that we ignore at our own peril.
There may still be disputes about exactly how much we're contributing to the warming of the earth's atmosphere and how much is naturally occurring, but what we can be scientifically certain of is that our continued use of fossil fuels is pushing us to a point of no return.
And unless we free ourselves from a dependence on these fossil fuels and chart a new course on energy in this country, we are condemning future generations to global catastrophe.

Environmental groups say the 6km-long (3.75-mile) long dam will threaten the survival of indigenous groups, and the lives of up to 50,000 people could be affected as 500 sq km (190 sq miles) of land would be flooded.
New research suggests that up to 150 million people could be displaced as sea levels rise by 30cm to 70cm by the end of this century.
This could result in flooding of low-lying coastal areas, including some of the world's largest cities.

“…slash-and-burn practice is very shortsighted and damaging to forests… Removal of the vegetation not only destroys the habitat for numerous species of plants and animals, but it also can lead to soil erosion, watershed degradation, and climate change in the area.
Once the vegetation is removed the rapid processes of plant growth, death, and decay that created the fertile environment are severely limited or entirely destroyed.” (1)
Inuit activist honoured by the United Nations for climate change work.
Evidence of climate change is being seen right now in indigenous communities in the Arctic.
Some people outside of the Arctic assume that climate change would be a good thing for Arctic peoples, if it means that the weather will get warmer.
Unfortunately, that is unlikely to be the case.
Arctic peoples are well adapted to their environment, and to using the plants and animals that are adapted to the cold northern weather.
As the weather gets warmer, people, plants and animals are becoming stressed.
Saami are seeing their reindeer grazing pastures change, Inuit are watching polar bears waste away because of a lack of sea ice, and peoples across the Arctic are reporting new species, particularly insects.
Some communities are having to sand-bag their shorelines to try to slow down an increase in coastal erosion, while in others, buildings, pipes, and roads are slumping because the permafrost is thawing.
Vital travel routes linking communities to each other and to harvesting sites are becoming dangerously unpredictable.
Routes across the ice become dangerous when the ice thins, or thaws at times different from the past, and water routes can also become dangerous as water flows change.

This information is perfectly valid but it's difficult to be sure that it reflects the concerns of the people who live in the region and face the local manifestations of climate change.

Climate change, a christian perspective, an argument for action on climate change based on our common humanity.
The Great Warming is a facinating fresh perspective on the problem of climate change.
We don't have the flash graphics and the head on approach of An Inconvenient Truth; we have a very nicely put together documentary about the impacts of climate change, focusing on human health, agriculture and personal stories.
This angle, along with the neutral term Great Warming, does well to move past the negative association that many US christians have with environmentalism.
It seems obvious to many that climate change is a moral issue, perhaps to obvious for the comfort of those of us involved in this issue within a secular society.
The involvement of the chirstian community therefore makes perfect sense, but how to get this 'creation protection' started?
The great warming is a superb start, it's suitability for church groups and it's solutions based approach are most wellcome!

In the Philippines El Nino Means Drought and Huge Carbon Release
According to Columbia University's International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI) El Nino cycles are associated with drought in the Philippines.
"Droughts are not generally associated with the Philippines, a country known for its steamy tropical marine climate.
But during El Niño cycles, much of the country experiences moderate-to-severe dry periods that can last for a season or more.
"
"[In] Manila, home to more than 10 million people, it is drought — not typhoons — that has led to rising tensions between urban dwellers and farmers who work just outside the city.
"
Whilst the verdict is still open on how the El Nino effect will be altered by climate change, the prevailing view seems to be that the base state of the atmosphere--the normal mode--will become more El Nino like.
According to RealClimate there is still much uncertainty as to how this will effect the events themselves, will the fluctuations remain the same (which would lead to more extreme floods and droughts if the atmosphere is already El Nino like) or will the events be tempered (leading to similar levels of extreme events)?
One very recent paper in the journal Nature suggests that extreme droughts and floods will indeed become more prevalent.
According to RedBolivia :
Study co-author Nerilie Abram says the new data suggest an unexpected link between monsoons and droughts in countries surrounding the Indian Ocean.
This year's drought in Indonesia is caused partly by a natural cycle of cooling in the Indian Ocean much like the El Nino phenomenon in the Pacific Ocean.
Despite this latest piece of science leading us to suspect a link between climate change and ever stronger droughts in Indonesia the media are by and large continuing there miserable failure to connect the dots.
The International Herald Tribune writes that inflation is up in Indonesia but completely fails to mention any possible link between climate change and this economic effect!
Another issue where there is no definitive evidence of a climatic cause but where this link is extremely likely and where key drivers are certainly environmental rather than political is the situation in Dar fur, but this is miraculously under reported.
Drought in Indonesia is, however, not simply worrying for the farmers and the nations economy but for the global community.
Thanks to rampant deforestation of old growth rain forest and the expansion of agriculture--particularly palm oil plantations into the heart of Indonesia--the number of forest fires has increased dramatically.
These fires are not, however limited to the dessicated fringes of rain forest but in many cases have led to the burning of the peat substrate on which the rain forests and newly planted crops reside.
Palm oil production in particular is having disastrous effects on the global carbon cycle, high carbon bogs have to be drained in order to create palm oil plantations.
Greenhouse gas emissions from this process across Indonesia have insured that in times of extreme drought due to strong El Nino Indonesia has--according to many estimates--supplanted the US for a time as the worlds largest contributor to climate change.
Palm oil is, ironically, being used more and more as a source of that green fuel Biodiesil!
First, let us think back to early in 2005, when catastrophic global warming hit the news as the biggest climate science conference opened in Exeter.2 Frightening evidence of climate change impacts and possible disastrous feedback mechanisms were published.
Most studies presented forecast a decline in grain yields, an expansion of deserts and a shrinking of the arable and habitable parts of the planet even at levels of warming which are probably now inevitable.
The collapse of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice shelves, of the Amazon rainforest, and perhaps even of the Thermohaline ocean circulation were shown to be real risks if greenhouse gas levels could not be stabilised quickly.
Whilst the media widely reported on the scary findings presented by climate scientists, the second part of the conference had a much lower profile: Recommending pathways which would help to stabilise the climate.
This is the remit of Working Group 3 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
Perhaps the most important paper submitted in this context was Pascala and Socolow’s proposal for ‘stabilisation wedges’.3 Pascala and Socolow argue that we need to choose from a range of technologies which we must employ on a large-enough scale so that together they reduce emissions enough to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.
Whilst most people would agree with the approach in general, the choice of technologies and the claims made for them are more problematic: One of the ‘wedges’ consists of having two billion 60mpg cars running on 100% biofuels, produced by 250 million hectares of high-yield crops, equivalent to one-sixth of the world’s cropland.
It is interesting to read the authors’ definition of ‘sustainable’ biofuels: “A sustainable biofuel is one obtained from plants that are replaced by new plants at the same rate as they are used”.
That’s it.
Another ‘wedge’ consists of ending deforestation and reforesting 250 million hectares in the tropics or 400 million hectares in the temperate zones.4 How this is compatible with the land requirements for biofuels in a world of falling grain yields and shrinking arable land, I do not know.
Yet Pascala and Socolow did not actually suggest that biofuels would cool the planet.
That idea came from two other contributors to the same conference, who appear to have a high profile within the IPCC Working Group 3: Peter Read and Jonathan Lermit.
They believe that biofuels are carbon neutral because they only release the carbon which they take out of the atmosphere whilst they grow.
If we burn them and capture and sequester that carbon in the process, then we will be extracting carbon from the atmosphere and, if we do it on a large-enough scale, we will be cooling the planet.
A large-enough scale, according to Read and Lermit, means using 40% of all arable land for bioenergy crops.
How can we squeeze so much more production out of the land?
We do so by intensifying agriculture across the developing world, farming all of Africa as intensively as Holland is farmed5.
The promised result?
A world where “the More Gas You Guzzle the Greener You Are”.
Putting hundreds of millions of hectares of land under energy crop monocultures and intensifying agriculture across the developing world is quickly being endorsed as a model for saving us from catastrophic climate change.
Detailed studies have been carried out for the IEA as to how this plan can be put into action.
Perhaps the most important one is the ‘Quickscan of Global Bioenergy Potentials by 2050’6, published by the International Energy Authority.
This provides a blueprint for increasing the global production of food, animal feeds and growing vast amounts of energy crops without increasing the global area under agriculture.
Those ‘sustainable biofuels’ must be produced essentially by eliminating traditional grazing and pasture economies and low-intensive and subsistence farming across the global South, and particularly across Africa.
It is up to national governments to decide whether rural communities should have a share of the profits.
All of the optimistic bioenergy scenarios assume that food production is not just secure but going to increase, without eating further into ancient forests and conservation areas.
As Eduardo Pereira de Carvalho, president of Unica, the union of cane-growers in Sao Paulo states: “As for conflict between food and energy, the fantastic increase in productivity has made all these Malthusian arguments completely nonsense, and we have hundreds of millions of hectares of idle land”8.
This optimism defies reality: Satellite images confirm advancing deserts across vast regions including north-central China (where two large deserts are about to merge and have already destroyed 24,000 villages in what was once fertile land), Kazakhstan (which has abandoned half its crop land since 1980 due to desertification), Afghanistan (where agriculture is being squeezed out by sand dunes and 100 villages have been lost), northern Africa (with Algeria now abandoning grain production in parts of the country), Mexico, and north-east Brazil.9 The biologically productive area of the planet is clearly shrinking, long before global warming inundates vast stretches of land.
The Millennium Ecosystems Report, published in 2005 was compiled by thousands of scientists and concluded, amongst other things, that 60% of all ‘ecosystem services’ have been degraded, 25% of the land surface is cultivated, and species extinction rates are 100-1000 times above the background rate.
It warned of an accelerating destruction of ecosystem services – even without fully taking climate change projections into account, nor without looking at a possible shift to large-scale biofuel monocultures.
Global warming, more frequent and severe heat waves, droughts and floods are a certainty for the coming decades – yet the ‘Quickscan’ report 6 states that it works on the premise that the climate will not change.
This should invalidate the entire report.
The Hadley Centre, a leading British climate research institute, predict that, ‘business as usual’ will lead to half of the planet suffering from drought and one-third turning to desert in coming decades.10 Over the last three years, Europe’s per hectare rapeseed yields have been falling due to ‘extreme weather events’11.
Global grain production has not reached the 2004 levels in either of the past two years, and world grain reserves are being drawn down as a result, raising the cost of staple food12.
A 2006
study of 700 experts, published by the International Water Management Institute and backed by the United Nations found that one third of the world’s population are now affected by water scarcity.
It predicted that, based on forecasts for population and food demand growth, water use would increase by 80% by 2050, and that growing biofuel crops will put further stress on ever scarcer water resources.13 On current and predicted climate trends, it is very difficult to see how people’s water needs can be met in future even without biofuels.
Surprisingly, I have been unable to find a single peer-reviewed paper which suggests that the main biofuel feedstocks – palm oil, soya, sugar cane and jatropha actually have lower life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions than fossil fuels at all.
There is simply no evidence to show that they are climate friendly.
Lots of studies exist about emissions linked to biofuels produced in Europe and the United States: We know, for example, that biofuels from rapeseed oil and sugar beet are linked to lower emissions than diesel or petrol, provided that no new, natural land is put under the plough - but also that thy can only replace a fraction of our energy use.
Germany uses 12% of its cultivated land for biofuel crops and can’t get beyond 2% of transport fuels without imports.
So why is there no peer-reviewed evidence on whether the tropical crops so widely promoted for biofuels are actually good for the climate?14 Could it conceivably be because a truly independent study on their life-cycle emissions might demolish the case for using them once and for all?
I have seen no scientific paper nor pro-large-scale biofuel institution which agrees with destroying rainforests to make way for energy crops – virtually all the organisations and papers which call for massive expansion of energy crops insist that this need not and must not happen.
Yet, unfortunately, biofuels are being introduced into a world run largely on neo-liberal principles – or, to be more specific, within trade rules which have a strong bias against regulation and any ‘trade restrictions’ to protect the environment, the climate or communities.
Where crops are grown is, by and large, determined by the market – not by scientists and NGOs drafting maps and plans.
The market favours those biofuels which are cheapest.
Generally that means those with the highest yields, which are tropical starchy and oily plants such as palm oil and sugar cane.
Lower-yield crops can capture the market if costs are kept low and governments guarantee an unlimited supply of new land and perhaps even subsidies – soy biodiesel being a prime example.
Rainforests, biodiversity, healthy soil and clean water and greenhouse gas emissions remain ‘externalities’ in the accounts, which will inevitably be sacrificed for real quick profits.
Take the Indonesian example: Although sustainable oil palm monocultures may be an oxymoron, Indonesia could at least tell its plantations companies that they should plant on the 12 million hectares of rainforest land which they already clear-cut and then abandoned, rather than granting them ever more concessions for new forest land.
But plantation companies make far more profits by selling timber than by growing palm oil alone – and they are powerful enough to stop policies which would cut into those profits.
Governments, institutions, NGOs and scientists are writing studies, many of them with dodgy claims, which show that biofuels could be grown without destroying any more rainforests, wetlands, peatlands, or biodiversity hotspots.
As a result, new markets are created which dramatically up the world market prices of palm oil, soy and sugar cane.
On the ground, plantation owners respond by growing more of those crops in the Amazon, in Uganda’s rainforests or in Colombia’s ancient forests and grasslands – unimpeded by regulations and unimpressed by those who tell them that they could be growing them somewhere else.
Trade rules, meantime, do not allow for discrimination on goods because of the way they have been produced.
Even if Europe might get away with a ban on deforestation diesel, they don’t even want to try.
Instead, there is a growing push to use biofuel expansion as a tool for pushing through further trade liberalisation and further barriers to regulation and environmental safeguards in the World Trade Organisation.16
One of Britain’s leading carbon capitalists and biofuel advocates is James Cameron, founder of Climate Change Capital.
He is a long-standing opponent of equal rights to the atmosphere, and an influential supporter of the Kyoto Protocol and its inequitable carbon market.
This is how he sets out his dire vision for Africa’s future: “The Africans are in a perilous position.
They will not be rescued by 20 years of debate about C&C.
Nor will they be rescued by the Carbon Market [or] beneficiaries of [it].
They’re going to have to really look to the possibilities that do exist in altering their economies to cope with very high fossil fuel prices and Climate Change at the same time .
. .
some combination of looking at land use and land use change issues; of coping more effectively with the water resources which are there; of growing biocrops; of ensuring that renewable energy technology is made available at low cost.”
This is a frank admission by one of the architects and profiteers of the carbon market.
He continues to advocate an extension of the present-day unsuccessful and inequitable carbon trading, knowing full well that it will not save Africa from being devastated by climate change, and that the carbon trade will not benefit its people.
It does, however, benefit him: Having helped to put the current emissions trading in place, he is now Chief Executive of a very successful merchant banking group which has just raised $380 million under Europe’s Emissions Trading Scheme, money which they will invest in ‘low carbon’ projects primarily in developing nations.
Climate Change Capital will be speaking at the Bioenergy Europe Conference in February 2007, a conference which will outline “the latest EU legislation and incentive schemes that aim to produce a dramatic increase in the use of biomass and biofuels across the 25 member states.”18 Clearly, biofuels are a profitable investment opportunity.
The above quote about Africa’s future was published by Aubrey Meyer, founder of the Global Commons Institute, who comments: “Cameron adds Africa to the growing pile of discards that the C3 scenario [i.e.
the Kyoto Protocol] inevitably causes and the economics of genocide inevitably requires.”19
We must remember, though, that biomass from waste will only meet a tiny proportion of our energy demand – there is little chance of it having any measurable impact on our greenhouse gas emissions.
Above all, we must remember that the EU Biofuel Directive, UN policies, bilateral biofuel agreements, etc.
have nothing whatsoever to do with this ‘green’ idea.
They are putting a global blueprint into action which is threatening local communities, biodiversity, water supplies, rainforest and the climate across the globe.
If people think that they can sit at stakeholder forums and make this blueprint sustainable then they should take some time out for reading: I would recomment those papers listed above which set out the global biofuel vision, the Millennium Ecosystem Report, and some good summary of climate change impacts.
As one UN Agency, international institution and government after another adopts this global blueprint, or adjusts its policies accordingly, we need to study the plans, and unite for the rights of the hundreds of millions of people who live on land conveniently classed as ‘degraded wastelands’ which are up for grabs.
We need to stop the web of biodiversity being destroyed by monocultures grown in the name of climate change mitigation.
And we need to speak out against anybody, no matter their scientific degree or qualification, who claims that monocultures can stabilize the climate.
There can be no sustainable energy system based on monocultures.
Today’s bioenergy revolution is already destroying some of the planet’s vital climate sinks and threatens to greatly accelerate the pace of global warming.
Accelerated global warming threatens all our future.
We have the evidence.
What we now need is a strong global opposition.
If you want to buy a carbon offset then they key desire is for the offset to be genuine, secondary issues such as the affect of the offset on local people and ecosystems are also important.
In the case of forestry you have to deal with biodiversity, indigenous rights and wider environmental impacts such as affects on hydrological regime.
Additionality and permanence are virtually impossible to grantee for forestry projects as the effects of climate change on forests are unclear.
In terms of transparency and rigour, offsets coming out of the NSW forestry projects are amongst the best around.
Carbon Planet uses credits from these sources.
In terms of benefits to biodiversity TreeFlights is one of the best companies around; it is arguable that it might be worth buying e.g twice the emissions offsets from organisations like these to ensure that you are truly carbon neutral as well as supporting reforestation with diverse native species.
MyClimate invests only in renewable energy or energy efficiency projects in developing countries, but specifically states that it does not support forestry sinks projects due to the risk that the carbon might be released back into the atmosphere in the long term.
Projects include solar power water heaters in Eritrea and Costa Rica, biomass in India, and methane to sewage in South Africa.
Local sustainable development and strict additionality rules are claimed to be foremost priorities for MyClimate.
A ‘team of experts’ from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology is responsible for verifying the projects.
One insidious belief that I have heard repeated several times by a range of people, from policy makers to member of the public and environmentalists is that environmental protection is something which you do when the economy is strong enough.
The major reason is the existence of Ecosystem Services.
In China, deforestation has been banned in some areas, and in fact some huge reforestation projects have been begun.
Green Futures magazine had a fascinating article on this recently.
The reasons for this are purely economic, a tree is worth more alive than dead.
Timber and pulp is of lesser value than the protection from flooding and landslides that trees provide for downstream farmers.
Numerous similar examples of highly threatened and highly valued ecological services are outlined in Lester Brown's book Plan B 2.0.
Finally, the Stern Review, recently calculated that unmitigated climate change would cost the world economy 5-20% of it's gdp whereas stabilising concentrations would cost between 1 and 2%.
Whatever the exact figures, the message is clear, we live by the green of leaves not the green of notes.
Without a stable climate and a thriving global ecosystems we cannot hope to have a thriving civilisation.
It is also worrying to me that by simply swapping coal for coal + ccs will give you a more pollouting plant in terms of local air quality.
Given the air quality in asia i do have some feeling about the morality of promoting a very expensive and more pollouting form of power that has the sole advantage of reducing carbon emissions.
Impacts on climate change and meeting our carbon emissions reduction targets.
The Camp for Climate Action Scotland has been tipped off that anonymous activists have successfully sabotaged the Glentaggart opencast coal mine in South Lanarkshire.
The unknown individuals have disabled the conveyor belt that moves coal from the mine to Ravenstruther rail terminal where the coal is then sent to Drax power station in Yorkshire.
The sabotage has the potential to greatly disrupt the removal of coal.
Insiders say that once it has been stopped it is difficult to restart the heavily laden conveyors which is several kilometers long and comes in quarter kilometer sections.
Drax powerstation was the site of the first Camp for Climate Action 2006.
The Camp for Climate Action Scotland is taking place cross the valley from Glentaggart at the site of another proposed open cast mine at Mainshill woods near Douglas.
A protest camp has already been in place for six weeks campaigning against the plans which have gone through despite strong local opposition.
The area is already one of the most heavily mined areas in Europe with a number of other opencast mines already being worked.
"“Fantastic.
Congratulations to those who did this.
Opencast mining is responsible for a spike in the number of lung related deaths in this small area.
It is time that the likes of Scottish Coal and the planning authorities are held directly responsible for their role in these deaths.
Climate change is a killer, both at home and in the Global South where those who have benefited the least from industrialisation are the first to pay the price.”"
The World Health Organisation estimates that climate change kills 150,000 people a year and that figure is expected to grow as countries fail to take action.
Cancer in the Douglas postcode area is 23% above the national average, and 28% above the regional average.
In the four years that the existing three opencast mines have been operating in the area pulmonary issues have increased 60%.
In a separate development the Camp for Climate Action has also learned that police leave across the central belt of Scotland has been cancelled as the various forces move to a state of high alert.
To date the policing at the Camp has been very low key, but campers remain alert.

The aims of the Camp for Climate Action Scotland are to highlight practical solutions to climate change from a grassroots level through education and demonstration of sustainable living, and to take direct action against the root causes of climate change.
It among the first of many such camps taking place this year.
Previously camps have taken place at Drax Powerstation, Heathrow and Kingsnorth Powerstation in the UK.
Yes, the Camp for Climate Action in Scotland is up and running, and needs you to come as soon as you can!
At the moment Climate Camp is busy with people building compost loos, grey water systems, cooking food and getting to know the local community.
We need your help to defend the trees and stop this site being turned into an open cast coal mine and contributing to climate change!
Greenpeace board a coal freight ship on it's way to make it's delivery at Kingsnorth.
EON's coal plant at Kingsnorth is the focus of campaigns by numerous organisations due to the govornments indication that a new coal plant could be built there as a replacement--the first new uk coal plant in 30 years.
Govornment policy has shifted somewhat, no new and entirely unabated coal plants are going to be allowed in the UK but a coal plant with a quater of its' carbon emissions captured as is currently proposed is a long way from the plans of a sane govornment.
If the govornment are keen on CCS then why dont they trial it rather than adding a token ammount of ccs to a vast polluting coal plnt which in all likelyhood will be around for 40 years?
The protestors are part of the Climate Camp movement and in particular the E.ON F.OFF campaign.
E.ON are planning to build the first new coal plant in the UK for over 30 years.
“BAM Nuttall say they need this work because of the recession, but this completely misses the point.
If we keep burning coal, then we’ll lose a lot more than just our jobs – people’s homes, health, food supply, and the stability of our society are all at risk from climate change.
Instead, we need to build a sustainable society, powered by renewable energy from the wind, sun and tides, which will lead to better ways to live and work.
We need to make sure that this transition is a fair one, actively involving workers from the energy industry.
We’re hoping to have some interesting conversations with BAM staff today about all of these issues!”
Several hundred climate change activists took part in a Pedal Power Bike Rush organised by the 'Climate Rush' around London yesterday evening (Monday 1 June 2009) demanding the UK government take effective action to counter climate change.
When six activists, protesting against climate pollution, scaled a tower at a coal-fired power station in 2007 the resulting court case drew support from the world's leading scientists.
Their subsequent acquittal proved historic and changed government policy.
Here, the 'Kingsnorth Six' tell their story
Six ordinary people.
One extraordinary feat of courage and endurance.
Twenty thousand tonnes of carbon dioxide belched into the atmosphere in a single day.
Twelve members of a jury, reaching a verdict that could change the future of the planet.
From these ingredients, Nick Broomfield has fashioned a film that tells the gripping and (the description is unusually literal) life-changing story of the Kingsnorth Six.
When a demonstration at the Kingsnorth power station in north-east Kent in late 2007 led to the arrest of six climate change activists, what had until then seemed a rather dry local planning issue exploded into a story of national and international concern.
The verdict at their trial turned out to have far-reaching implications for activism, the future of coal, even the planet.
It is a story that began in October 2007 when a coal-fired power station at the mouth of the river Medway was nearing the end of its natural life.
E.On, the German company that owns and operates it, had applied the previous year for planning permission to build a replacement on the site.
This would be the first new coal-fired power station in Britain for 30 years, but a string of similar applications was lined up behind.
If Kingsnorth went ahead, it was reasonable to assume coal-fired power stations would be built across the country.
The government gave every indication it was intending to give permission, though it is widely acknowledged that coal is the single greatest threat to the climate, responsible for about half the fossil fuel carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere.
The average Briton emits 11 tonnes of carbon a year; it would take this one hypothetical Brit 1,800 years to emit the equivalent of a day's emissions at Kingsnorth.
So, at 5am on the morning of 8 October, protesters waving placards jostled noisily at the front gates of the power station.
While the plant's security guards were distracted, another group of about 30 activists made its way quietly along the sea defences at the rear, cut a padlock and sneaked onto the site.
"A security truck with a couple of guys tore up," says Ben Stewart, who was there.
"We said we were Greenpeace and we had to shut down the power station because of climate change.
They said, 'Good luck.
Do it safely.
'"
The smokestack was filthy.
They had coal dust in their mouths, up their noses.
They had to scrape it off like tar.
After hours of struggle - "I'm told it was nine but it felt like 12," Stewart says, "a dusty, dark, carcinogenic, hot, horrible experience for hours and hours and hours" - they saw light at the top.
They were running at least six hours late.
They rested briefly to recover some strength, aware that if they stopped for too long it would get dark.
Williams rigged up ropes.
Emily Hall, who works for Greenpeace in logistics, mixed paint.
Rose shot photographs and film.
Stewart spoke to the outside world, including his parents.
"You might see me on the news on top of a power station chimney," he warned them.
"They said, 'Are you sure that's wise?
'"
They decided they were too exhausted to get back safely that night, so they went inside the chimney and slept in the heat and coal dust until 6am.
After a breakfast of tinned tomatoes, bread and coffee, they packed up and started back.
"It felt OK to come down then," Stewart says.
"We felt we'd done something important.
"
Perhaps, though, they weren't entirely dismayed.
Any criminal damage charge for more than £5,000 has to be tried by a jury.
"My first thought was, 'I'm going to go to jail,'" Stewart says.
"My second was, 'But I'm going to get a jury trial.
'" It would be an opportunity to put the climate change case in public.
The trial opened at Maidstone Crown Court (in Ann Widdecombe's constituency, perhaps not the first place a climate change activist would choose) on 1 September 2008.
"Michael Wolkind prepared really diligently," Stewart says, "but his first line to the jury was, 'They care about Tuvalu.
Do you too?
' And I thought, 'That's it, I'm going down.
'"
The standard defence against criminal damage is that by committing the crime, the defendant prevents damage to more valuable property - so it's acceptable to kick down the door of a burning house if you thereby prevent its complete destruction.
The argument Wolkind and his team had to make was that shutting down Kingsnorth for 24 hours was a significant contribution to retarding carbon emissions, preventing the worse harm of climate change.
They also had to establish that there had been no legal options.
To everyone's surprise, one of the world's leading climate change scientists, Professor James Hansen, responded to an email from Joss Garman, Greenpeace's coal campaigner, by saying he would testify on behalf of the Six.
Hansen, whom Garman describes as "a rock star of climate change", has been director of the Nasa Goddard Institute for Space Studies for the past 20 years, an adviser to US presidents, and was the first person to testify to Congress on the seriousness of climate change.
While in the UK, he met the prime minister and the foreign secretary, because that is the kind of person he is, but his reason for coming was to testify in a small courtroom in Kent.
The nub of his argument was that every tonne of carbon counts, so that while it may not be possible to pinpoint the extinction of one species to a particular molecule of carbon, it is reasonable to assert that Kingsnorth alone would lead to the extinction of 400 species over its lifetime.
Both Geoff Meaden, professor of geography at Canterbury Christ Church University, and Hansen produced maps showing the impact of rising sea levels on the Kent coastline, the world's leading climate scientist giving a private seminar to the jury about the future of their area.
Inuit leader Aqqaluk Lynge described the melting of polar ice and its impact on Inuit homes and food supplies.
Gordon Brown had just changed his mind about an autumn election; Zac Goldsmith argued that this had closed the normal democratic channels, especially given that it had recently been estimated that the world was a mere 100 months away from a climate tipping point.
Jennifer Morgan, a former adviser to Tony Blair and an expert on international climate negotiations, said the G8 had failed to deliver significant progress in preventing catastrophic change.
The defence's arguments were given a boost by the 2006 Stern review for the British government, which put a price on climate change for the first time, calculating that each tonne of carbon causes $85 worth of damage.
This means that shutting down Kingsnorth for one day may have prevented around £1m of damage.
Each of the defendants had prevented 3,300 tonnes of carbon from entering the atmosphere (their share of a normal Kingsnorth day's output).
It would have taken them 300 years of zero-carbon living apiece to have had an equivalent impact.
That night, the 10 o'clock news reported that a government decision on the future of Kingsnorth had been postponed.
That this was a U-turn is not in doubt.
E.On had already gone out to tender for construction of the new plant.
Exchanges between the company and the civil servants in the Department of Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR), obtained by Greenpeace under Freedom of Information legislation, prove that the government had been drawing up conditions for approval of Kingsnorth and was prepared to be conciliatory about how far these related to climate change.
Within a month of the verdict, business secretary John Hutton was reshuffled and responsibility for energy moved from BERR to the new Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC), which put energy where it belongs, not with business, but with the environment.
The new secretary of state was Ed Miliband who, with David Miliband and Hilary Benn, had previously opposed a new Kingsnorth in cabinet.
These are highly technical questions.
What is clear, even to those of us who are clueless about the science of carbon capture or unqualified to judge whether the energy gap can be bridged without coal, is that Kingsnorth is now unlikely to go ahead without offering some hope for climate change.
The publicity generated at the plant in October 2007 and the subsequent verdict has almost certainly (as long as Miliband doesn't crack) paved the way to a more thoughtful energy policy which has climate change at its heart rather than as bolt-on, entirely dispensable rhetoric.
German company E.On applies for planning permission to replace the existing plant at Kingsnorth in Kent with the first new coal-fired station in Britain for 30 years.
The plant would produce an estimated 19,800 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions every day.
The head of the government's sustainable development commission, Sir Jonathon Porritt, tells the secretary of state that a new generation of coal plants would "destroy the overall credibility of the government's climate change programme".
Environmental activists hold a climate camp outside Kingsnorth for 10 days.
Hundreds are arrested while taking direct action against the plant.
The trial of the Kingsnorth Six - those involved in the scaling of the tower - takes place.
Professor James Hansen, director of the Nasa Goddard Institute for Space Studies and the first person to testify to Congress about the threat of climate change, gives evidence on their behalf.
All are acquitted.
The committee on climate change finds that coal stations should be expected to capture and bury all of their carbon emissions by the early 2020s.
Ed Miliband, secretary of state for the newly created Department of Energy and Climate Change, announces a change of policy on coal, ruling out unabated coal stations.

We need to reduce the carbon output of of electrcity sector dramatically.
Govornment and industry have been convinced that we the people arent going to back down on this point.
So the question is: what are the solutions being offered?
Nuclear power is on the table and as soon as it becomes economically feasible I'm sure british power companies will dispatch carrier-pigs to deliver the news to the department of energy and climate change.
In the mean time, there are new ideas.
Offer #1 Is carbon capture and storage(CCS).
Offer #1 promises many of the negatives of standard coal power with some added complications, a reduction in efficiency and a long term waste storage issue.
On the positive side it can mitigate climate change at a cost somewhat lower than the construiction of hydrogen powered jet planes.
The bar seems to have been set rather low by this question.
CCS plants would generally pollute more than coal, would use more water, would have higher capital requirements and more maintaince staff than coal.
They would offer but one advantage: less carbon dioxide emitted.
The idea that the world is going to move from one inneficient a polluting technology to an even less efficient and more polluting technology that costs more is a little hard to swallow.
From the outset we can name renewables which cause negligible degrees of air and water pollution as well as eliminating water consumption.
We then have to look at costs, which for wind can be lower than standard coal already, and which will only go down with production capacity increases.
Finally, we are left with intermitancy and the status quo.
We have to find a way of dealing with intermitent sources of power.
We also need to find a way of convincing people that whilst is it certain that the great majority of our present electricity is derived from fossil fuels it is not certain that even a small minority of our future electricity will be produced that way.
This may seem like simple terrain for an overheated argument about CCS but much of it comes down to the presuposition of important bodies that 'coal is going to play an important part in our energy future' and a rising clamour of voices stating that 'incalcation does not amount to a solid argument'.
If we dont want to fire up backup generation then we have to move from temporal to spatial coping mechanisms.
Use of high voltage transmissions lines over large distances can help by both smoothing out the renewable energy resource supplies and by allowing for the inclusion of more distant storage supplies.
Although there are numerous challenges to be overcome, it does seem likely that a smart grid system with long range high voltage lines does offer the potential for a cleaner, low carbon electricity system with reduced demand on water resources for less than the cost of coal with carbon capture and storage.
So don't forget: 'coal is going to play no part in our energy future'.
LEIGH SALES: Six of the nation's leading climate change scientists have written to the coal industry, telling them to shut down power stations and take responsibility for the damage coal burning does to the environment.
The Guardian has generally been very sympathetic to the Climate Camp.
The Guardian has always had a strong editorial line on climate change and many readers sypathise with our activities.
One of our main activities has been an ongoing campaign against eon .
As eon are planning the first new coal plant in 30 years at Kingsnorth in Kent I think that our motivation is quite transparent; allowing new coal development in the developed world is not only damaging on our own climate targets but also on our credibility and on the climate negotiations as a whole.
eon try to distract from this hugely distructive role that they are playing by--i kid you not--putting a few solar pannels on a coal plant!
The Guardian recently ripped this to shreads .
Given the sympathy towards us, and the antipathy towards our targets it is somewhat baffling to see that rather than inviting Climate Campers along to there climate change summit for our take on the challenge ahead, they invite eon to become a major sponsor !
Finally it may be worth noting that eon's head office has been visited and protested by: Climate Camp , People and Planet , Christian Aid ...and possibly a few others.
Civil society in the UK is united against this company but The Guardian feels able to sell them some much needed credibility.
Tonight members of the camp for climate action where on...
EON 's plans top build the first new coal plant in over 30 years continue to focus the minds of climate change activists throughout the country.
"114 activists were arrested in a 2am raid on a community centre in Sneinton Dale , Nottingham early on Easter Monday, 13th April 2009.
It is believed that a protest was planned at the Eon powerstation at Ratcliffe-on-Soar and Eon has released a statement confirming this.
The Ratcliffe-on-Soar coal-fired power station is the 3rd largest source of carbon dioxide emissions in the UK and has been previously targeted by activists.
Similar to past police actions, some of the homes of those arrested have been raided while they were held in custody.
It has been confirmed that 5 properties have already been raided in Nottingham and the SUMAC Centre and personal paperwork and computers have been seized.
Activists are now being released on bail, to appear in court on 14th July, with no other conditions.
More raids are expected.
This police action is reminiscent of the arrests of climate change activists in April 2007 when they were on their way to protest against the M1 widening.
While the protestors were held in custody their homes were raided and computers were taken.
A year after the arrests the M1 case was thrown out of court.

E.ON is still committed to the development of cleaner coal and carbon capture and storage (CCS), insisted a company statement.
"We believe these have a key role to play, alongside renewables, gas and nuclear, in tackling the global threat of climate change while ensuring affordability and security of energy supplies.
"
However, the question mark now over Kingsnorth could have implications for the UK energy strategy, which is based on using a diverse range of resources.
This includes a continuing, big role for coal, which currently accounts for 37% (29GW) of the UK's electricity capacity, and generated 31% of the UK's electricity in 2008.
That level is, however, set to decline to 21GW as stations close in accordance with EU controls on sulphur and nitrogen emissions that cause acid rain.
Under plans announced by Ed Miliband, secretary of state for Energy and Climate Change in April, up to four CCS demonstration facilities are to be built in the UK.
This is part of ambitious government plans to require coal-fired power operators to capture all carbon emissions from their plants by around 2025.
All new coal-fired power stations, including demonstration plants, will have to capture at least 25% of their carbon emissions on startup.
Alongside the Government's ongoing competition to build a post-combustion CCS demonstrator, up to three further 300-400MW projects including pre-combustion technology will be funded by a new - yet to be developed - levy mechanism.
Power generators must prove that any new power station is 'carbon capture ready'.
The criteria here include: having sufficient space available to retrofit CCS; a suitable potential offshore area to store carbon dioxide; and a feasible potential transport route from the power station to the storage area.
- the strongest signal yet, from developed and developing countries alike, that CCS must be incentivised as part of a global climate deal in Copenhagen this December.
Energy and climate change secretary Ed Miliband, who co-chaired the Forum (CSLF) with Norway, said: "There's agreement that we need countries around the world to finance demonstrations, as we are doing in the UK, we need technology co-operation for know-how and capacity building and a financing agreement at Copenhagen which can drive CCS forwards in developing countries.
"
Finance was identified as the biggest barrier to seeing more full scale integrated CCS projects in operation.
The Global CCS Institute reports there are 64 full scale integrated CCS projects under way in the world and 7 are operational.
Ministers also considered a new IEA CCS roadmap that suggests 100 CCS demonstration projects are needed by 2020 to combat climate change, and half of these should be in developing countries.
Ho set out to reformulate the thermodynamics for living systems , based on this core principle, which has “large implications for ecosystems, food, health and economies.”
Wudja believe all that road salt we spread for “safety” purposes actually ends up somewhere else…like our groundwater and streams.
(You mean there is no “away” place we can throw this stuff?
) Duh!
Nor is this just about the impacts on aquatic life and drinking water.
It’s also about destroying roads, shortening the life of cars, and killing vegetation.
WTF?
As we track and anticipate climate change in these islands, the one certainty seems to be that we are in for â€œweirdâ€ weather.
Yeah!
Ain’t blip.tv gr8!
Already, many of the videos from last week’s Hawaii Conservation Alliance conference on climate change are uploaded and waiting for your perusal.
Watch ‘em here .
With our military budget now approaching $700B annually, a new report from IPS urges Obama to shoot for a minimum of $30B in each of the next 20 years for climate change initiatives, including R&D and retrofits for government facilities (via grist ).
Grist’s Kate Sheppard notes that this need not be a zero-sum game, since climate action could be funded from carbon cap revenues (if they ever emerge from Congress).
Still, ‘twould be smart to ratchet down on the gunboats as we ratchet up the green generators.
Even with the stimulus package, Obama’s military spending is still 9 times higher than climate action.
“Yes, it’s important to reduce waste and toxins in a company to protect our diminishing natural resources”, says Werbach.
Citing the horrors of ocean acidification, a major boating company has launched a ‘call-your-Senator’ campaign to push for a climate bill even stronger than Waxman-Markey.
Kewl!
West Marine sent emails to its customer base making the connection between CO2 and ocean acidification, noting that “solving one will solve the other”, and urging boaters to “demand far greater emissions reductions than were able to pass the House.”
Especially with ‘Big Coal” flooding the Senate withÂ cries for even more loopholes , this is a heartening sign.
Sure, I’m an economist, yet I’ve let all the recent financial news just wash over me.
(I gave up ‘stuff’ after Hurricane Iniki.
) I’m amazed that so many folks who’ve worked hard to “make it” are now not much better off than the rest of us.
The European Union (EU) has recently taken the lead on combating climate change.
On March 14th, EU leaders agreed to finalize their Climate Action Plan (CAP) by next year.
The CAP is a set of policy proposals released in January, which aim to meet the EU’s two goals for emissions reductions:
1. an EU commitment to achieve at least a 20% reduction of greenhouse gases by 2020 compared to 1990 levels and an objective for a 30% reduction by 2020 subject to the conclusion of a comprehensive international climate change agreement, and
At a two-day summit held March 11th and 12th, leaders from the EU Member States agreed that legally binding legislation governing Europe’s climate change policy would be very beneficial.
Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jansa, chairman of the summit, stated that this commitment to finalize negotiations by the end of the year was a “huge step forward.” This agreement between Member States is important because it is indicative of the strong level of commitment to treating climate change as a real and serious concern.
But the EU’s decision to create an ambitious, uniform climate change policy is not just important as a symbolic act, it is also important because of what it can accomplish.
This is because of the nature of the CAP and its timing.
The EU is attempting to put a policy in place before the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change talks in Copenhagen in November 2009.
This is the meeting where the post-Kyoto emissions standards will be created.
By finalizing the provisions of the CAP by the end of next year, the EU will be in a strong position to set the international standard at this meeting.
A strong European CAP would demonstrate to other countries, such as India and China, that a substantial and sincere commitment to combating global climate change is possible, despite criticism from industrial and public utility sectors that such a policy is too costly.
The European Union has a great opportunity to make its CAP an example of progressive climate change policy which can be acknowledged and built upon by other nations at the Copenhagen talks.
The agreement that the plan will be finished in time for these talks is encouraging.
But the impact of the Europe’s climate policy at Copenhagen is not dependent on its completion date, but on its content.
Negotiations on the specific proposals of the CAP will be debated for the next year.
This is an ample of amount of time for Member States opposing the CAP in whole or in part to push for compromises lessening the economic burden on industries and thus weakening the impact the plan would have on combating global climate change.
The CAP is based on four proposals :
These proposals, in their general form, are not particularly controversial.
But these proposals supply only the EU Commission’s basic strategy for accomplishing its emission reduction goals.
The controversy is in the details.
For instance, regarding the revisions to the ETS, the Commission has proposed that auctioning of emissions credits will be subject to common EU rules, not the rules of specific nations.
Inevitably some nations will support the EU’s allocation of emissions credits, while some will vehemently oppose it.
Under the EU rules, the power sector will be subject to auctioning beginning in 2013.
Nations in the EU block that would have imposed little or no environmental regulation on its own power sector will obviously oppose the Commission’s plan.
The same scenario is true with each of the CAP’s specific proposals-some nations will win and some will lose.
The critical inquiry is whether the nations who will lose economically from the CAP will have enough political clout to weaken its biting impact through compromises and exceptions.
To mitigate the effects of climate change the world needs a powerful, comprehensive, international agreement from the Copenhagen talks.
The EU’s recent proposed action plan and commitment to its finalization before Copenhagen are encouraging signs that Europe understands and accepts the undeniable truth that the quality of the world’s future will be decided by present climate change policy.
With so much at stake, will Europe actually create meaningful climate change policy?
A year’s time will tell.
While trusts are most often used for private purposes, the concept can and arguably should be utilized to protect the environmental and natural resource legacy that present generations will pass on to future generations.
These trusts are legislatively formed and protect assets that belong to the public, so they are known as “public trusts,” rather than private.
While the APF does place the state’s natural resources in a trust for the benefit of future generations, it is really about making the money last for future generations rather than the natural resource itself.
In order to really protect the environment and natural resources so that they can be passed onto future generations as a well-kept legacy, the environment or natural resource itself—rather than just the money that comes in from depletion—needs to be placed in a trust.
A group of senators in Vermont are trying to do just that.
For example, the air or atmosphere could be placed in the Common Assets Trust to protect against the harms of greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming .
While Vermont has already signed onto the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) ,which plans to place a cap-and-trade system on carbon dioxide emissions from fossil-fuel burning power plants in the region, that initiative only covers two percent of the carbon dioxide emissions in the state .
The Trust could catch the other 98% of CO2 emissions in the state (as well as other greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming) by establishing clear limits on greenhouse gas emissions from all sources, charging emitters for their use of the atmosphere, and distributing the proceeds as dividends to Vermonters on a pro rata basis (as well as using the funds for other beneficial purposes).
Like the RGGI, the Trust could set up a cap-and-trade system that would apply across the board, protecting Vermont’s common asset (the sky) so that it can be passed on to future generations.
Not only would trust help protect the atmosphere through direct regulation and management, it would also create incentives for Vermonters to make better use of these common assets.
It would provide an economic incentive to emit less, because the more you emit the more you pay (eventually surpassing the amount you received back in dividend-form).
Also, the trust would spur economic development in the state for energy conservation and alternative energy initiatives.
The amazing thing about this bill is that it represents a drastic departure from the approach that government has historically taken regarding common assets.
Instead of business as usual, Vermont is trying to protect the natural legacy that will be left for future generations by placing the environment itself in a trust—just like many private citizens do when they want to protect property that will be passed down to their descendants in the future.
The concepts of discounting and the time value of money are not new.
Anyone who takes a course in microeconomics or business will find the basic concept somewhere in their text around chapter two.
Who can forget Wimpy’s famed quip, “ I’ll gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today ?” So how then has this economic concept found its way to the forefront of environmental discourse, especially around intergenerational equity and climate change ?
This is where climate change fits into the discussion.
Because the greatest costs of global warming will be felt in the distant future, policymakers must do this same type of analysis.
Regulatory actions to address climate change today will benefit future generations more than present day American citizens.
Given Sunstein and Rowell’s illustration, one can easily see that discounting becomes a menacing hurdle when searching for ways to protect future generations from climate change damages.
One strategy used to overcome this obstacle is to chip away at the economic theory underlying discounting.
Another way is to look again to the language of the Executive Order which allows for modification to the benefit cost analysis.
It does so by suggesting two approaches, either modifying the discount rate or supplementing the analysis with an explicit discussion of equity issues.
This departure from a traditional cost benefit analysis, however, was rejected by the Fifth Circuit in Corrosion Proof Fittings v. EPA when it invalidated EPA’s ban on asbestos.2

Since Mr. Gore’s film debut, public awareness of climate change has dramatically increased.
But how much do people actually know?
That winter might be milder next year?
More importantly, how much does the younger generation know?
There has not been a mandated environmental curriculum to empower younger generations since the Reduce, Reuse, Recycle .
While progress has been made to educate the overall public about the climate crisis the world is facing, we are failing to adequately prepare the next generation — the one most immediately affected.
In some extreme cases, we are even promoting their ignorance under the pretext of partisan political views .
Recognizing the increasing number of pediatric diseases and developmental problems linked to climate change, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are calling on all pediatricians to incorporate considerations of climate change’s health effects into their professional practice, including lifestyle practices, political advocacy, and most importantly, patient education.
According to the AAP, children are most vulnerable to adverse effects of climate change because of their physical, physiologic and cognitive immaturity.
These consequences range from injury and death from extreme weather events and natural disasters to increases in climate-sensitive infectious diseases and in air pollution and heart-related illnesses.
Deaths from asthma, which is the most common chronic disease among children, are expected to increase by nearly twenty percent by 2016 unless urgent action is taken.
However, while the AAP’s dedication to children is commendable, we must do more.
Young people must be informed about the dangers of climate change and its dramatic effects on their health, environment and future, as well as the solutions.
The decisions we make today have a significant impact on younger generations and the generations to come.
It is imperative we include today’s youth in the decisions we make as a nation and as a world.
Together we need to prepare a youth that this not only climate-change literate, but prepared to fight the battle.
Therefore, the Department of Education must mandate a comprehensive climate-change curriculum that can be incorporated into all grade and subject levels.
Currently, science mandates vary from state to state and it is dependent on individual teachers to incorporate climate change education into their curriculum.
Governmental agencies, such as the EPA and the DOE , as well as NGOs, have developed a plethora of educational climate change computer resources.
However, these resources depend on independent students and educators to find them and put them to use.
Last May, Senator Obama sponsored a bill to authorize the National Science Foundation to establish a Climate Change Education Program .
Aside from being referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, action has yet to be taken.
This program would create a national information campaign to disseminate information on climate change, new technologies, and programs related to energy conservation, renewable energy, and greenhouse gas reduction.
Further, the Climate Change Foundation will create education materials relevant to climate change and climate science, develop K-12 curriculum, and publish climate change and climate science information in print, electronic, and audio-visual forms.
More than forty-six percent of the world’s population is younger the twenty five years old.
They are the next generation of environmental stewards and the more they know today, the more positive influence they can have on our world tomorrow.
Education has consistently been the most effective way to empower young generations to take responsibility for their own health.
For example, in its first two years that Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids used the Truth Campaign , smoking rates declined by 1.5 %, or 300,000 fewer youth smokers.
While the younger generation will feel the effects of climate change, we do not need to leave them un-armed to continue the battle.
Not only will educating children engage them in the global and local realties of climate change, but it will create a sense of empowerment at a young age.
As H.G.
Wells so eloquently wrote in 1920, “human history becomes more and more a race between education and catastrophe.” Let’s hope education wins.
Fast forward to the 21st century, where climate change threatens all we know and love.
From socio-economic impacts to complete loss of life and culture, we stand at a unique moment in history.
The Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change states that the “[w]arming of the climate system is unequivocal, as is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice, and rising global average sea level .” Estimates for the cumulative economic impact of rising sea levels, more frequent hurricanes and droughts, higher rates of infectious diseases, and other climate caused effects are in the trillions of dollars.
More importantly, global warming will displace millions of people leading to increased warfare, suffering, and ultimate death.
Global warming offers a distinctive challenge to the social movement paradigm.
Although Americans widely recognize that global warming exists, they view the repercussions as distant and removed: few care about the potential flooding of Indonesian archipelagos in fifty years, while many care about health care and the Iraq War today.
Yet major U.S. newspapers carry weekly stories on local, current impacts—from threatened maple trees in Vermont to wildfires in Colorado and hurricanes in Louisiana.
To move beyond climate change cognizance to action, people must be engaged in their individual communities, via families, schools, religious institutions, colleagues, and clubs.
In this way, citizens move the discussion from global warming is coming, to it’s here and what do we do now.
Given the present failure of government to address global warming, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) play an important role in connecting individual citizen advocacy with meaningful government response.
Not only are NGOs composed of and directed by citizens like you and me, but years of experience allow them to efficiently organize and educate on a massive scale.
NGOs like Greenpeace , Climate Action Network , Environmental Defense , and Natural Resources Defense Council educate the global citizenry about climate change and its consequences.
They petition governments for policy change as well as challenge judicial decisions and administrative rulemakings.
Asha-Rose Migiro, Deputy-Secretary General of the UN, stated that the “United Nations depends upon the advocacy skills, creative resources and grass-roots reach of civil society organizations in all our work.” Today, NGOs have become “ the world’s third superpower .”
In the face of government inaction, Australia provides an example of individuals and NGOs working together on progressive climate policy.
Although Australia exports the largest amount of coal in the world and joined the U.S. in rejecting the Kyoto Protocol, record drought and its toll on the agricultural sector—particularly cotton exports—raised Australian concern over global warming.
As drought forced farmers off their lands and into cities, people sympathized with the plight of the agricultural sector.
As education and awareness grew, people questioned the impacts of global warming on Australia’s ecology and lifestyle—from the current drought to Great Barrier Reef destruction and the spread of disease.
The Queensland Conservation Council responded to public opinion by pressing both the government and the courts for greenhouse gas mitigation.
This massive turn in public perception ultimately led to a political reevaluation of Australia’s climate change position.
In fact, the Australian federal election in November 2007 marked the world’s first climate change election .
Not only did the victorious party offer the strongest climate policy, but the entering prime minister’s first action was to sign the Kyoto Protocol.
Australia’s climate change movement progressed from individual and NGO action to an eventual political response.
There is no reason why we cannot do this in the United States.
After we engage in civil society and stress regional climate implications, U.S. NGOs will provide the next link by consolidating our voice and directing it at influential decision makers.
Step It Up , for example, organized the first open source, web-based day of action devoted to stopping climate change.
In April of 2007, more than 1,400 communities across the U.S. joined force to offer the following explicit message: “Step It Up, Congress: Cut Carbon 80% by 2050.” Not only does Step It Up bring together individual voices, but it also works with other organizations like 1Sky to further centralize the global warming movement.
Through mobilizing Americans around the climate change crisis, U.S. NGOs can help build enough political will to deliver real, meaningful, long term solutions.
Almost two and a half years ago, “ the most anticipated disaster ” in U.S. history tore through Louisiana and Mississippi.
Despite the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) warning that New Orleans was one of the U.S. cities most susceptible to natural disasters, Hurricane Katrina resulted in the displacement of over half a million people .
Still today, thousands of those who fled Hurricane Katrina remain unable to return to their homes in the Gulf Coast Region.
While the displacement caused by Hurricane Katrina is devastating, the level of displacement that occurs in developing countries is even more serious given that these countries are even less equipped to prepare for and respond to natural disasters and the resulting displacement.
Yet natural disasters resulting from climate change are more apt to strike developing countries than the better positioned developed countries.
Natural disasters are the leading cause of displacement and resulted in the migration of over 25 million persons from their homes by 1995 .
For example, in the African Sahel, five of the ten million persons displaced due to severe drought were unable to return home.
In Burma, the responses to climate change create 105 million displaced persons at any given time.
In addition, desertification in Morocco, Tunisia, and Libya results in the loss of more than one thousand square kilometers of valuable land each year.
As the environment continues to deteriorate due to climate change, the number of natural disasters such as drought, flooding, soil erosion, desertification, deforestation, and violent weather disturbances will continue to increase in quantity as well as severity , which will result in even more environment-induced migration.
The large number of EDPs poses a major concern: where will they go?
Currently, no country recognizes climate change as an acceptable immigration status.
Several articles suggest that New Zealand has such an agreement with Tuvalu—an island nation that statistics predict will be completely submerged within the next 40 years.
New Zealand, however, has given an official statement declaring that such suggestions are mere rumors.
While the United States does provide Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to natural disaster victims, it is limited in application and scope.
TPS only applies to applicants from a foreign state that has officially requested recognition as temporarily inadequate to provide its nationals with a safe return and that state temporarily cannot provide the applicant with a safe return.
Even the 2.6 million EDPs affected by the 2004 tsunami and the 2005 earthquake in India and Pakistan did not receive protection under TPS.
Overall, the United States and other developed countries continue to take similar steps to further limit the flow of immigrants coming from developing countries, regardless of their reason for immigrating.
An additional concern that results from the colossal number of EDPs is the further destruction to the environment caused by mass migration.
An increase in population necessitates an increase in housing facilities and means an increase in human waste and pollution as well as deforestation and wetland destruction.
Host countries often are not prepared or are unable to provide for EDPs, leaving them to fend for themselves and exploit the already scarce natural resources.
The host country’s meager natural resources must then stretch even further, often to the point of unsustainability.
When natural resources become scarce and survival is difficult, social and political conflict often follows.
Academics now, at least partially, attribute the conflict in Darfur to the decline in soil quality.
It resulted from the atypical weather patterns caused by climate change and corresponding changes in the migration patterns of pastoralists.
Conflict, then, also leads to further destruction to the environment because fighting results in further deforestation, pollution, and degradation of water sources and further displacement.
Climate change therefore generates a vicious cycle.
Even though developed countries are responsible for the majority of greenhouse gas emissions, and therefore climate change, currently developing countries take the hardest hit from climate change’s effects and those of accommodating EDPs.
Still, every nation is affected by climate change and with each hit these effects come closer and closer to home—whether that home is in a developing or developed nation.
For example, the addition of 1.4 million displaced persons in Bamako, Mali, which eventually led to a subsequent migration to England, brought threats to national security and the spread of HIV and other diseases.
From December 3–14, 2007, more than 10,000 participants representing over130 nations will come together on the island of Bali, Indonesia—the “Island of the Gods”—for the 2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference .
The conference marks the thirteenth conference of the parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) , which the United States is a party to, and the third meeting of the parties to the Kyoto Protocol , which the United States has chosen not to ratify.
According to the United Nations, the main goal of the conference is to deliver a “necessary breakthrough” and begin “negotiations on a new international climate agreement” that will replace the Kyoto Protocol when it expires in 2012.
While the conference is not aimed at delivering a fully negotiated and agreed upon climate plan, it is hoped that the Parties will agree on the key strategies and areas that the new agreement will cover, such as mitigation, adaptation, technology and financing.
The United Nations is also pushing for the parties to agree to a 2009 deadline for ending negotiations so that the new climate change deal can be ratified by 2012, avoiding a gap after Kyoto.
The conference comes on the heals of the September 17 release of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) fourth assessment report , which is a synthesis of three previous working group sections that were released between January and April of this year.
The first section dealt with climate trends, the second dealt with the world’s ability to adapt to global warming, and the third examined strategies for reducing global carbon emissions.
When the IPCC released this synthesis report, the scientists concluded that the evidence was “more explicit,” created “new emphasis and alarm,” and placed “the reality of human-induced global warming beyond any doubt” (in case there were any out there still questioning the already overwhelming evidence).
Rajendra Pachauri , a scientist and economist who heads the IPCC, stated: “If there is no action before 2012, that’s too late.
What we do in the next two or three years will determine our future.
This is the defining moment.” While the scientific community has again spoken on the urgency of the problem, the biggest hurdle is getting the political community to come together in agreement as well.
The United States’ refusal to ratify Kyoto, or agree to any domestic or international plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat global warming, is something that the United Nations hopes will begin to change in Bali.
The UNFCCC Executive Secretary, Yvo de Boer , has called on the United States to play a “more constructive role” in the international scheme.
De Boer is also looking to “re-engage” Australia and “more strongly engage major developing nations,” such as Brazil, India, and China (which is set to replace the U.S. as the largest greenhouse gas emitter this year, if it hasn’t already).
Fortunately, one of these nations seems to be answering the call.
Australia elected a new prime minister this week, Kevin Rudd , who has promised to cut Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions, plans to sign on to Kyoto (or its successor), and will attend the Bali conference.
Rudd has even spoken to Al Gore , who will also attend the conference, about what needs to be done globally regarding climate change.
With Australia planning to ratify Kyoto, the United States is now the only industrialized nation to refuse to join the international effort.
While this has not brought about any drastic (Australia-like) policy changes in the U.S., the Bush Administration does seem to be getting on board, albeit slowly.
The Administration’s reaction to the IPCC report, delivered by the chairman of the president’s Council on Environmental Quality, James L. Connaughton, was that the President agrees that “the issue warrants urgent action, and we need to bring forward in a more accelerated way the technologies that will make a lasting solution possible.” The Administration has also decided to send a U.S. delegation to the Bali conference, led by Under Secretary of State for Democracy and Global Affairs Dr. Paula Dobriansky and joined by Connaughton and several others.
The White House released a statement last week announcing that “[t]he United States is committed to advancing negotiations in Bali, leading to a new international approach on energy security and climate change.” This is not a definitive promise to join a post-Kyoto regime or substantially reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, but it clearly indicates that the Administration isn’t digging its heels in anymore or focusing on scientific controversy.
While the U.S. has acknowledged the problem and seems to be ready to cooperate, the world needs action, not lip service.
The United Nations and the rest of the world hope that the United States will prove that they are on board in Bali, but no one is hiding the fact that these changes will not come easily and will be met with a certain amount of resistance.
Secretary de Boer acknowledged that it will “take time” to convince America to join any future climate change regimes, but the hope is that the U.S. will at least commit to working towards a post-2012 agreement.
While the outlook painted by the IPCC is grim, the door has not closed, and the world has an opportunity to work towards saving Mother Earth—or “Ibu Pertiwi” as it is called in Balinese—from some of the future impacts and repercussions of climate change in Bali.
Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, who will be welcoming the thousands of conference participants to his nation, has stressed that the Bali conference is an important “opportunity to assure present and future generations that their prospects would not be dimmed by climate change.” Only time will tell, and all eyes will be on Bali over the next few weeks to see if thousands of members of the current generations can move towards change that will benefit the earth’s future generations .
If you have seen the news lately, you know that global climate change is getting more attention than ever before.
You probably also know that national governments around the world say they are taking serious action to solve this problem.
Among these nations are Britain and Russia.
In Britain , Prime Minister Brown recently stated that the UK government was looking at the possibility that its target of a 60% cut in carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 was “not ambitious enough.” Russia , as a party to the Kyoto Protocol since early 2005, continues to work to reduce its carbon emissions and has prepared a list of emissions sources and a register of emissions reductions.
But are these countries, as significant emitters of carbon, really acting faithfully to their stated goals of combating climate change?
On October 17th, 2007 the BBC reported that Britain is going forward with its claim to sovereign control over one million more square kilometers of Antarctic waters, to gain access to the oil reserves below.
The report states that this claim is legal under controlling international law, namely the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of December 10, (UNCLOS III)1982, and the environmental provisions added to the The Antarctic Treaty of 1991 .
Although the British government says that it knows that any present exploitation of natural resources would violate these treaties, this land grab, at its core, calls into question this nation’s true commitment to exceeding its Kyoto carbon reduction goal.
The message here is “we will do our best to combat global climate change, but in the mean time hedge our bets and find more oil.”
The message is being sent by Russia as well, which in July 2007 sent a submarine to the Lomonosov Ridge, the deep seabed under the Arctic Ocean which spans 460,000 square miles.
The purpose of this expedition was to prove scientifically that the territory — and the 5 billion metric tons of oil thought to be located there – is part of Russia’s continental shelf under United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of December 10, 1982, Part VI .
This provision states that “the coastal State exercises over the continental shelf sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring it and exploiting its natural resources.”
Although the steps Britain and Russia have taken to appropriate areas of the deep seabed are likely to be legal under controlling international law, it seems that these steps are deeply hypocritical, given these nations’ respective stated policy goals of reducing fossil fuel emissions.
Certainly Britain and Russia have violated the spirit of the law and the Common Heritage of Mankind (CHM) principle on which UNCLOS III and the Antarctic Treaty are based.
The CHM principle is a principle of international law written into treaties controlling common heritage regions, such as outer space , or those controlling property thought to be held in common for the good of all mankind, such as the DNA sequencing models from the Human Genome Project .
The CHM principle prevents any one nation or private party from appropriating common heritage areas or common heritage property; it also directs that benefits derived from these areas or property be shared equally.
Moreover, the CHM principle requires preservation of these areas or property for future generations, and using them only for peaceful purposes.
The CHM principle incorporates elements that will likely be essential to combating global climate change.
The steps that Britain and Russia have taken to appropriate the deep seabed for oil extraction run contrary to the CHM principle.
When one observes these actions, it is then difficult to keep faith with these nations’ stated goals for carbon reduction.
The stakes of mishandling solutions to the climate change problem are too high for nations to engage in policy “double speak” The public must make the connection and see the hypocrisy of engaging in deep sea oil prospecting while pledging to combat global climate change.
More fundamentally, increased public awareness of the CHM principle, as international law which encourages cooperation among nations in managing the commons for the benefit of all mankind and future generations, is needed.
If someday this principle is applied to the atmosphere, nations will hopefully adhere to both the letter and spirit of international law protecting the atmosphere from destruction by fossil fuel emissions.
Impacts of climate change are now being felt across the European Alps and future scenarios predict even greater changes, which will include a reduction in snow cover at lower altitudes, receding glaciers and melting permafrost, and changes in temperature and precipitation extremes.
These changes have potential implications for critical aspects of Alpine economies, including winter tourism; exposure of human settlements and infrastructure to natural hazards; agriculture and ecosystems; and water resources.
Adaptation to these observed and projected impacts is therefore becoming increasingly important – both to limit near and medium term damages and also to avoid decisions that might exacerbate vulnerability to climate changes over the longer term.
The Wengen 2006 workshop took place from October 4-6, 2006, and brought together experts from the climate science, policy, and economics communities together with decision-makers from countries within the Alpine Arc to examine the vulnerability of particular sectors and systems to climate change impacts, and more importantly to assess progress on the formulation and implementation of adaptation responses at local, regional, and national levels.
A particular focus was placed on: the role of government and private actors; comparative experiences between the Alpine countries; synergies and conflicts between adaptation responses and other priorities.

This weeks report of the week is actually a free book.
Just how you respond to this will probably depend on a couple of things; do you have time to read a 400 page book about climate change at the moment, and does the book actually cover a topic which is worth learning something about.A slightly condenced ;-) attempt at summarising all this information is also available here , a short report
I have no idea how much spare time you have but i do know it wont be wasted if you decide to read this book.
The report is derived from the research presented at the January 2005 conference Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change .
This conference, held at the behest of the UK govornment was so successfull and its conclusions so stark that futher funding and resources where supplied to the organisers by the UK department of the environment (DEFRA).
The research presented in january was up-dated as a result of discussions that occured as these climate scientists met and exchanged ideas.
Now all the researh presented has been analysed and integrated into this book.
I thought i`d just show all you climate change action users where the other users are from.
This weeks reccomended website is by the canadian broadcaster CBC.
This site isnt hugely indepth, but it is very informative about the impacts of climate change on Canada and is also very nicely and simply presented.
Just click on a part of canada to find out how climate change will effect it.
I know CBC do some good work on Climate Change, and when i looked back-sure enough-i found a previous piece of audio of the week from there website here .
Far more depth about climate change
I try to cover as wide a range as options for climate change mitigation as possible in this blog, I also try to talk about the consequence for the many different stakeholders, undoubtedly I lean towards the environmental issues as this is where my sympathies lie.
However I have just found a few good articles and reports about climate change in relation to business consequences.
This article in the journal Science talks about the subject of attribution of damages to environmental causes, particularly present and future climate change.
This article in Forbes describes the difficulties of insuring under a climate of change, insurance could become a major overhead for many businesses as there is less certainty in a more unstable climate system.
As I have mentioned previously climate doesn't gently shift, rapid fluctuating transitions-painful transitions- are more likely (for more on this look for the work of Richard Alley of PennState University).

prospects of increasing climate instability are daunting, and panelists
(BusinessWeek article + More...)In a totally remarkable article BusinessWeek report on what some of the world top corporations are doing in terms of climate change mitigation, both for saving associated with energy conservation and in terms of using low carbon technologies so they are ready when the regulatory environment changes.
It is widely expected that post-Bush there will be a nationwide carbon tax in the USA as there is already in Europe, and such schemes are likely to link up globally in the medium term.
In another recent report on the dangers of Climate Change to business by CERES it is warned that:
is renewed calls in the wake of Hurricane Katrina for the federal government
2.
I`m looking for a job at the moment (un-surprisingly I want to work in energy policy/climate change campaigning) so my next feature article on chunks of progress towards mitigation will be in the pipes for quite a while.
Over the months since i have been doing this blog i have subscribed to quite a few mailing lists about climate change and related issues.
Of these there are perhaps 3-4 that i regularly read.
One of these consistantly interesting newsletters is by the WBCSD .
Here is the latest issue , there is also the option of subscribing if you
This weeks action online is more of a personal commitment than an action.
I regularly listen to eco-talk radio which is one of the few good national radio shows about the environment, this often involves climate change.
The Bush Administration has come under renewed pressure at a recent conference 6 previous heads of the EPA called for federal action to fight climate change and not just token funding for technology, but for actuall mandatory caps within a trading system.
"The message to the Bush administration on global warming couldn't be clearer: Do something.
Since 2001, climatologists, environmentalists, economists, world leaders, governors, senators and business executives have been begging President Bush for something more than another study or voluntary cutbacks by industry on greenhouse-gas emissions, which trap atmospheric heat and warm the Earth.
(more below...)
Rising surface temperatures are melting ice caps, raising sea levels, and hurting plants and animals in ways scientists predict will increasingly endanger human health.
A study published in last week's journal Nature documents the first species believed to have been wiped out by global warming.
Joining the chorus for action this week were six former administrators of the Environmental Protection Agency dating to William D. Ruckelshaus, the agency's first leader, who served President Richard Nixon.
During a discussion Wednesday celebrating the 35th anniversary of the EPA, five Republicans and one Democrat agreed: Global warming is real and getting worse.
The United States should stop ignoring it.
William K. Reilly, who served President George H.W.
Bush, called remaining skeptics "outliers.
" He demanded remedies - such as energy-efficiency incentives or mandatory emissions reductions - instead of more hot air about the validity of climate science.
Global warming is rising on Congress' agenda, thanks to influential advocacy from senators including John McCain (R., Ariz.) and Joseph Lieberman (D., Conn.).
But key committee chairmen such as James Inhofe (R., Okla.), who once termed global warming a "hoax," still block most good ideas.
Last year, Inhofe called novelist Michael Crichton, father of the "techno-thriller," as an "expert" witness.
A medical degree and well-footnoted fiction don't qualify Crichton to advise Congress on protecting the atmosphere.
Other countries are acting aggressively to reduce man-made contributions to warming.
They're wisely heeding scientists' warnings that the ill effects of climate change will only accelerate the longer humans tarry.
Dr. Terry Root was interviewed by Ira Flatow on Science Friday about the Impacts of Global Warming on Species .
Her part of the show starts in at 14:45.
A very interesting interview highlighting some of the key environmental issues for the future.
The consequences of climate change on disease distribution are also looked at.
The video of the week is a great introduction to climate science.
The issue of climate science and the media is also looked at.
I must also point out that although a great introduction that doesn't mean there is nothing original in the presentation, i have been interested in climate change for several years i i found it refreshing and interesting.
Stephen Schneider is a professor of biological and climate science at Stanford but actually graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering and Plasma Physics from Columbia university.
He was heavily involved in the Third Assesment Report (TAR) of the International Pannel on Climate Change (IPCC).
Schneider is also working on the "Key Vulnerabilitites" cross cutting theme for the Fourth Assesment Report (4AR) now being undertaken by the IPCC to be published in 2007.
Slightly moving off track, I think the 4AR is going to have a huge impact when it is published.
The date of publication is not long before the third meeting of the parties (MOP) to Kyoto and bearing in mind the huge advances in science and the increased evidence of climate impacts occurring currently I think it is going to be a far stronger statement than the current standard for climate science the TAR which is a rather conservative document.
This weeks report is a review of global renewable energy capacity and potential.
This is a facinating report which is perticularly wellcome as it provides one clear example of real progress in the fight against climate change.
A previous report by the tyndall centre looked at climate change mitigation as a three part problem: 1.
Reduction in energy usage 2.
Increase in energy efficiency and 3.
Decarbonisation of energy supply.
It looks like the world is making
The website of the week is a project of the climate group called "North South East West" which aims to highlight the current and future impacts of climate change around the world.
This website describes the various aspects of climate change impacts and illustrates each with high qaulity photos.
"Climate change already touches every corner of the planet and every aspect of people’s lives.
As our global temperature increases, its impacts will become even more extreme.
To illustrate this we commissioned 10 of the world’s top photographers to bring together, in a single volume, what is happening in diverse countries and conditions around the world.
This is their record.
"
Climate change brings a whole new demention to concervation, you are afterall attempting to protect a unique ecosystem/landscape combination.
Climate change will force species to adapt or perish, for many species adaption will mean moving.
What then is going to happen to national park boundaries?
How severe are these effects going to be?
These are a couple of the issues delt with in this short report by the WWF which attempts to highlight some of these important questions.
"Protected area agencies have rightly resisted attempts to move protected area boundaries or de-designate protected areas for periods of time.
But under climate change, species for which a particular protected area was established may no longer survive there.
Some protected areas—for instance in coastal, arctic and montane regions—may disappear altogether in their current form"
For the rest of the reports i`m currently reading look over to Climate Change Resources .
My next article is going to be a look at the major pieces that make up climate change mitigation strategies for the future.
These pieces include The likes of: Distributed energy systems, increased car efficiencies, cuts in aviation growth etc.
In short I will be looking at discrete 'chunks' of progress.
The climate group was set up in 2004 :
"The organization was founded in 2004 by a diverse group of companies, governments and supporters who saw the opportunity to create new momentum in the international effort to stop global warming"
The "year in review" is facinating, it shows just how much has been happening in relation to climate change during 2005.
Left to Right: Dr. Gavin Schmidt (NASA Goddard Space Flight Center), Dr. Paul Knappenberger (President of the Adler Planetarium and Astronomy Museum), Dr. Wally Broecker (Columbia University), and Dr. Ray Pierrehumbert (University of Chicago) pose for a photo after the first of the Global Climate Change forum.
Forum I was held at the Adler Planetarium.
This is the first "action of the week", the idea is to pick a new online petition, letter or scheme to support each week and it will always be only a couple of minutes work , so do your good deed for the day, fight climate change from the safety of your own livingroom.
Wally Broeker will be a familiar name to anyone with an interest in climate science.
In this presentation he talks about the need for concerted action on climate change and describes the changes that very well may occur if we continue to "rock the boat".
The inocuous term global warming has never been acceptable to climate scientists, it betrays none of the complexity; indeed the globe may be warming on average but on local scales there may be cooling and there are certainly likely to be changes to the climate that have a far greater impact than the locallised warming.
Changes in precipitation, evaporation, extreme weather events, the time of the year the rain falls, the intensity of the rain etc.
These changes are innevitable to some degree, but if carbon emmisions are not brought down rapidly and dramatically we risk even greater re-adjustments to the climate system, changes such as the shutdown of the ocean conveyor (gulf stream in the north atlantic), changes to the monsoons and re-location of the ITCZ over Africa.
" Dr. Wallace S. Broecker is perhaps the world's leading interpreter of the Earth's operation as a biological, chemical and physical system.
His research interests include paleoclimatology, ocean chemistry, isotope dating and environmental science, yet he is probably best known for his identification of a "great conveyor belt" of ocean currents that plays a critical role in earth's climate.
His research has shown that the earth's climate has shifted abruptly many times in the past, and he has been a leading voice warning of the potential danger of increased greenhouse gases in earth's atmosphere.

"The Global Roundtable on Climate Change brings together more than 150
high-level, critical stakeholders from all regions of the world — including senior executives from the private sector and leaders of international governmental and non-governmental organizations — to discuss and explore areas of potential consensus regarding core scientific, technological, and economic issues critical to shaping sound public policies on climate change.
Such a consensus, if reached, could have a major impact on the international community due to the high-profile stakeholder status and top-tier professional positions of Roundtable participants.

The Tyndall Centre recently produced a major report entitled "Decarbonising the UK: Energy for a Climate Conscious future".
This report was the result of research undertaken in one of the Tyndal centres four major themes of research and represents the combined knoledge of world renowned experts from the universities of Oxford, Cambridge, UEA, Manchester and others.
Cutting the growth of aviation is the minimum required in order to mitigate the effects of future climate change.
The government has consistently failed its citizens in this; its duty of environmental protection.
Instead it has followed what the environmental audit committee describe as a predict a provide approach.
This strategy will lead to aviation emissions rising sufficiently to"entirely negate" emissions reductions made elsewhere in the UK economy.
Climate Camp: How Can We Mainstream the Marginalised?
The Camp for Climate Action , could, potentially be sidelined as an event for environmental extremists, since camping outside an airport is hardly a mainstream activity.
Ahh, i got it!
They could ban all the members from a whole range of groups such as the RSPB (one of the UK's largest membership bird conservation clubs) and the National Trust (the one that protects historic buildings and our best nature reserves).
These are two of fifteen groups that are set to be banned from a large area around Heathrow airport...an amazingly brazen attack on civil liberties by large corporate power.
Not exactly the sort of thing to get the support of local people, or the media!
This is in order to prevent there members from making it to The Camp For Climate Action
The injunction is designed to prevent ordinary people attending this year’s climate camp, a fun, peaceful week of workshops and talks about climate change.
See http://www.climatecamp.org.uk/
Claire Fauset writes on behalf of the Camp for Climate Action in the Guardian .
"Next month's Camp for Climate Action will put Heathrow airport at the frontline of direct action on climate change.
Hundreds of people, including many from the local community, will be camping there.
"
Camp for Climate Action comes to Heathrow this summer
Aviation is the fastest growing source of greenhouse gas emissions in the UK, and all our efforts to tackle climate change in other sectors are undone by the massive growth in air travel.
Holding the camp at Heathrow aims to highlight the lunacy of the government's airport expansion plans, target industry giants profiteering from the climate crisis, and raise awareness of the need to fly less.
The camp will also support local residents in their long-term struggle against the building of a third runway and the destruction of their communities.
Although the location is different, the philosophy of the camp remains the same: to be a place for the burgeoning network of people taking radical action on climate change around the country to come together for a week of low-impact living, education, debate, networking, strategising, celebration, and direct action.
The camp will feature over 100 workshops covering topics such as climate change impacts, carbon offsetting, biofuels, peak oil, permaculture, practical renewables, campaign strategy, skills for direct action, and much more.
Run without leaders by everyone who comes along, it will be a working ecological village using renewable energy, composting waste and sourcing food locally.
It all comes down to us, now.
We are the last generation that can do anything about climate change.
In 20 or 30 years' time, should we not change our ways, we'll be committed to emissions increases that will see forests burn, soils decay, oceans rise, and millions of people die.
If we don't get this issue right, so much else is lost too.
It has been left out of the first faltering frameworks to control emissions, eg.
the Kyoto Protocol and the Climate Bill.
The presence of Harmondsworth detention centre nearby highlights the plight of environmental refugees and the fact that climate change is fundamentally an issue of social and global injustice.
“We are concerned that prospects for growth in carbon offsetting, and the accompanying benefits in terms of lower global emissions, are being held back by suspicions that a lack of regulation and transparency in the market is allowing some schemes to be promoted which do not achieve acceptable outcomes.
This is a pity in view of the contribution offsetting can make to tackling climate change.

The month saw some extremely high daily rainfall totals, with 103.1 mm falling in the 24-hour period ending at 10 p.m. on 25 June in Fylingdales, North Yorkshire.
At this stage, it is not possible to say whether intense rainfall events are caused by climate change.
However, there is an expectation of heavier extreme rainfall events in most places as climate warms and the atmosphere becomes moister.
The Met Office works with government, the public and the private sector to forecast and advice on the possible consequences and risks of climate change.
With the 'normal' baselines changing, we all need to seek advice to make informed planning decisions and begin to put in place adaptation measures to meet the challenges posed by climate change.
There have been several groups of business leaders calling for action on climate change recetly, including the Global Roundtable on Climate Change (GROCC--Chaired by Columbia University) and the Climate Action Partnership (CAP--Chaired by Pew Centre for Global Climate Change).
Now another group (Via Carbon Planet ) broader yet, has got together to call for action on climate change, and the attendant regulatory certainty that they can work within.
This new grouping includes Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Peabody Coal , both of whom have lobbied massively and persistently against climate change regulation.
Whilst this change is encouraging, the latest partnership doesn't get into details on what is required to reduce emissions.
I characterised a recent article by Jim Manzi as a repositioning of the climate skeptic line, position 5, climate change is caused by us, it is bad, we can do something about it, it is worth doing this, but lets not be hasty we don't want a carbon tax or cap and trade.
This final position isn't ruled out by the latest partnership, yet it is clear that cap and trade is required, possibly along with a carbon tax, and a whole suite of more climate friendly policies.
The major transformative nature of climate change has to be accepted for us to approach our goals.
They are calling for an overhaul of the beef industry, after their audit revealed producing the meat caused substantial amounts of greenhouse gases and other pollutants.
It's worth noting that beef consistently scores badly in terms of it's climate change impact, other meet's often do far better.
A general rule that i am starting to use is 'avoid beef, moderate the rest of your dietary meat intake'.
I love the blurb about this podcast, the speaker is described as an optimist, this is justified by the fact that he thinks we can avoid climate change becoming a 'complete catastrophe'.
In uncertain situations views on outcomes are determined more by personality than by anything else, but i lean towards the thought that not believing climate change is going to be at least a very serious problem is starting to look not just optimistic but like naive wishful thinking.
The most important uncertainties have been reduced and the scope of the challenge is daunting for almost anyone with a true grasp of the picture.
Michael Oppenheimer explains ( MP3 ) climate change and discusses ways to deal with this mounting crisis.
A self-described optimist, he believes that we can change our behavior and prevent complete catastrophe.
There Kyoto Protocol was an important start in the fight against climate change, however there where many inadequacies.
One of the most important is the absence of industrialised nations such as the US and Australia from the agreement, this problem--of comprehensive buy-in from the developed world--has been exacerbated by the complete lack of effort made by Canada, a signitory.
The most likely political crisis i see at the negotiations for a post-2012 climate treaty is buy-in from India.
China will also be a challenge, but a united front from the developed world is essential.
A political roadblock at these negotiations could one of the greatest failures of govronance to ever occur.
The question is, is there the momentum required on this issue?
At the moment I don't think so, although we are nearing that point.
We need a awakening around the globe to this issue, as we have seen in the US, much of Europe and Australia.
Climate change is a more significant political force but still, i don't believe it is regarded as a first order challenge such as security or health.
It remains surprising, to this day, that human civilisation is so dependent on climate.
Often these links are not obvious, this being particularly the case in industrialised nations.
However, these links are real, and more and more areas are being investigated for climate vulnerability.
A project-- Noah's Ark --by the European Commission to investigate the impacts of climate change on Europe's cultural heritage has just been launched .
This EC project takes a detailed look at climate impacts, using the latest knowledge of material science.
A brochure with programme outline and an simple explanation of the work can be downloaded from here (PDF)
The project is however, limited in scope to Europe, another organisation very much involved with architectural preservation is UNESCO.
A report earlier in the year by UNESCO on the threat posed by climate change to world heritage sites received a great deal of attention.
More on UNESCO and climate change here .
The threats posed by climate change to natural and cultural sites on UNESCO's World Heritage List are outlined in a new UNESCO publication, "Case Studies on Climate Change and World Heritage" *.
The report features 26 examples - including the Tower of London, Kilimanjaro National Park and the Great Barrier Reef - case studies that are representative of the dangers faced by the 830 sites inscribed on the World Heritage
Sea Ice...how is it changing?
Compollation of research by EU
The EU's science framework includes a significant amount of emphasis on better understanding climate change.
A Dec '05 meeting lead to the production of a book ( PDF ) on sea ice research, pulling together much of the science available on changes in the Arctic region.
The wide-ranging papers in the book cover the methods used to measure ice thickness, on scales from basinwide down to local; the results obtained; the modelling of ice thickness;and the implications for Man’s activities.
Palaeoclimatic studies are also described, which reveal periods during the past 100,000 years when the Arctic Ocean has been ice-free, a challenge to our understanding of Earth system processes.
Since the disappearance of the Arctic sea ice is literally the most visible aspect of global warming in action – we can see the change in the face of the planet from space - it is appropriate that the European Commission should take the initiative in seeking to understand this phenomenon.
As climate change shows no signs of going away, more and more organisations are offering information and analysis on the topic, as well as ways of collaborating online.
The latest new blog with climate and energy policy being disucssed is from NRDC, very much mainstream US environmentalism, and a good group of bloggers to reflect the reputation.
Switchboard ( switchboard.nrdc.org ), [is] NRDC’s new global warming and energy conservation blog.
Switchboard features NRDC's policy analysts, scientists and lawyers responding to the day's news and commenting on policies to combat global warming and address America's energy needs.
Europe-wide research by nef (the new economics foundation), using a new measure of carbon efficiency and real economic progress reveals that Europe is less efficient today than it was 40 years ago.
The European Happy Planet Index: An index of carbon efficiency and well-being in the EU reveals (overview) for the first time the carbon efficiency with which 30 European nations produce lives of different relative length and life satisfaction for their citizens.
nef's analysis, (report) published in association with Friends of the Earth, also looks back over the last 40 years and comes worrying conclusions in an age of climate change, when it is more important than ever that we use our resources efficiently.
nef's Index reveals that:
Global warming is one of the biggest issues of our time, the European Commission says in its description of this video report.
One of the most promising technologies is Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS).
This a means of capturing CO2 from sources such as power plants, compressing the CO2 and storing it away safely in geological formations underground or under the seabed instead of releasing it into the atmosphere.

In the UK, tabloid papers (and my parents) regularly get wound up about the increasing power they perceive as being ceded to Europe from national Parliaments.
I see this as largely unfounded, in the areas that i am interested in Europe generally has a positive role to play.
Nation states are not limited to European standards for there climate policies for example, bu they are bound by minimum requirements.
I`m not sure where Europe is going on biofuels at the moment, but this could conceivably be a counter to my views as europe as a generally positive phenomenon.
Whatever happens, the framework for review and accountability is well established, as explained in this fascinating podcast by Andrew Moravcsik, Professor of Politics at Princeton University (it gets started at minute 20 after lots of introduction that can be skipped).
As i started by saying, dealing with environmental issues, or indeed broader ones such as climate change is political, you have to look at neo-liberalism and what it has done to the planet and say, this cannot continue if we wish to survive let alone prosper.
If talk of political/economic ideologies is to much for contemporary environmental organisations then they need to change.
When did you last see the WWF, Conservation International the RSPB or any other major conservation charity get seriously political?
In ' The Death of Environmentalism ' this ies exactly the argument being made by the authors.
In ' Capitalism asif The World Matters ' Jonathon Porritt makes the same case.
Finally, to get to the point, the UK's parliamentary environmental watchdog has published a report showing just how destructive the WTO is, particularly in stymieing vital environmental legislation.
Reducing emissions from deforestation is a pretty awful way of looking at things.
To spend a day in a rainforest and walk through one acre, to look at the immense biodiversity, the innumerable forms of life and an almost infinitely complex web of interactions, this is an experience that we should not deny future generations.
This beauty should add up to more than just carbon, yet , a new urgency comes to protecting our forests, not because of a new appreciation of there qualities and innate value, but rather because of the dire consequences of there destruction on our planet as a whole.
Deforestation is a significant contributor to climate change and many people have been looking at how we can best address the problem.
For an introduction to forest destruction, and what this means for the global climate you might be interested in a recent conference at the Environmental Change Institute of Oxford University.
For a four page introduction to the overall discussion, this document may be of interest (draft summary for SB side event 19 May 2006, 18.00-20.00).

“…slash-and-burn practice is very shortsighted and damaging to forests… Removal of the vegetation not only destroys the habitat for numerous species of plants and animals, but it also can lead to soil erosion, watershed degradation, and climate change in the area.
Once the vegetation is removed the rapid processes of plant growth, death, and decay that created the fertile environment are severely limited or entirely destroyed.” (1)

Hopefully, Live Earth will make a real difference in public awareness and attract talented young people to become scientists – it’s a cool job with a real purpose.
I am looking forward to Nunatak’s appearance in the Live Earth concert inspiring young people the world over.”
This is a really superb video about urban design, transport and climate change.
It takes a few minutes to get going but by 10 minutes in it is very compelling viewing.
Climate Clinic : A Chance for a broad coallition of NGO's to educate and lobby MP's.
Plane Stupid where represented at the climate clinic by Joss Garman, Dr Parr of Greenpeace
Dr Parr accused the aviation industry of not engaging with the challenges posed by climate change, asserting that it was 'rhetorically accepting it, but actually not dealing with it'.
We shared the experiences of how the poor in Kenya and El Salvador are affected by climate change.
We showed them that climate change is real, it’s really happening; it is the poor of the world, who are the smallest emitters of greenhouse gases, who are the most affected by the carbon pollution of the developed industrialised countries like the UK.
The institute of public policy research has quite a bit of audio , some on climate change, transport etc., from both the Lib Dem and Labour Party conferences.
The Lib Dems are the only ones who have taken climate change on as a central party theme for there conference.
For this reason, there is a fair amount of video available with the party leader and other party members discussing the issue as a central part of the conference proceedings.
The latest publication by IPPR on climate change is just out.
A follow up to 'Warm Words' this report ( Warm Words II ) studies how the dialogue about climate change is changing.
What are the words being used, how is the issue being framed and what are the predominant groupings (Discourses) of language, these are the questions pursued through research on UK media and broader communications materials.
1.
To map the public discourse of climate change in the UK, especially highlighting what has changed since the work we conducted in 2006.
This meant careful mapping of the dominant frames and discourses evidenced in popular print, television, radio and online national media coverage of climate change (for example, newspaper articles/columns, government publicity, influential blogs, material from non-governmental organisations [NGOs]).
2.
To look at what characterises climate change discourse at the local level – how local press, local authorities and groups engaged in climate-related activities on the ground construct and talk about the issues and their own actions.
3.
To compare these sources and discourses, and suggest implications for national and local communications and activities for all those seeking to change public behaviour on climate change.
This website is called Climate Change Action.
I believe that every post up until this point (several hundred) has been on climate change.
The last thing the world needs is another American led invasion in the middle east.
This would be a regional disaster and may spread beyond the region.
The consequences of having another issue bought on itself would be awful, not least in lost political capital on issues that really matter.
Namely, climate change, extreme poverty, environmental degradation, health and global inequity.
A worthwhile event if you are based in or around washington DC.
The only thing that i know about this event is that the UK arent planning to send a minister, let alone the PM.
It looks like a bit of a farce.

In a clearly manipulative move, George Bush is inviting top leaders from around the world to Washington, D.C. on Sept. 27th and 28th to officially convey his "deep concern" about global warming.
His proposed fix: more useless "voluntary" measures and huge subsidies for "clean coal" and nuclear energy.
The event is clearly meant to undermine real international efforts now underway to achieve mandatory greenhouse gas cuts under the Kyoto process.
Top ministers and heads of state from around the world will be attending Bush's conference as well as a great concentration of national and international media.
We need to show up and loudly proclaim our own message: George Bush doesn't speak for us!
We want real climate action now!
Recently i've been focusing less on climate impacts and more on solutions/politics here.
There are a lot of climate impacts, and they tend to be depressing and quite scary...depressed and scared people arent really likely to act to improve the situation: that isn't a motivational combination.
However, one recent story really caught my attention...reports are going around that this years arctic ice melt has been the fastest and largest yet, breaking records set just a couple of years ago.
Roughly an extra million sqaure miles of ice have melted as compared to the average minimum.
It strikes me that when we talk about many topics such as: 1.
Business Energy Usage 2.
Green Buildings 3.
National 'Intensity' targets.
We are talking about emissions relative to the past.
We need to talk about emissions relative to our planet, in other words, one big paradigm change of the climate challenge is saying no to relative targets: we dont live a a relative planet the logic dosent work.
If we accept relative targets for buildings (90% bigger than that size, when smaller sizes are possible) then why not for businesses?
If for businesses then why not for countries?
If for countries then why not for the world...answers are all the same.
I finished this video a while back...hope you enjoy it.
It's a few of the highlights from the Camp for Climate Action set to one of my favourite songs on M.I.A's new album, the song is Paper Planes.
It's been quite a productive few days here in Aberdeenshire, although it has to be said, not as glamarous as what 'Honey' is getting up to in India.
At our last meeting in Aberdeen we had quite a broad ranging discussion of our plans for the next few months.
In perticular we are starting up the Critical Mass again, initially on the rising tide day of action against the Royal Bank of Scotland (which calls itself the oil and gas bank ).
We also decided to find out more about a joint meeting proposed by several groups and brought to us by Christian Aid.
We are keen to help groups lobby local mp's about making the climate bill as strong as possible.
Finally, the situation at Aberdeen university seems very interesting, due largely to attempts by a member of shared planet to bring all environmental and ethical organisations together for a joint meeting on Sep 29th; this is a very exciting prospect.
There was a good deal of future work to come out of that meeting, but more on that can be read on our website .
Apart from the groups activities in Aberdeen we have also been busy fundraising for the office in London: the base of the Global Climate Campaign .
We just had a fundraising event at my parents t-room and raised nearly 850 pounds.
I was very pleased with that...we had a very busy day and quite a few generous customers.
Now we have to think bigger and see what else we can do...suggestions for big fundraising idead welcome!
In the meantime you can donate here .
There are now two bloggers on Climate Change Action, myself and secret mystery girl Honey Tan Bunzl (that's her porn name).
Honey (I have to abbreviate!
) is helping the Global Climate Campaign to build a presence in India.
A very important and worthwhile thing to do as i`m sure you will agree.
So where to start ......well i arrived in Delhi Sat.
morning with nine hours delay yes I know some of you will Be horrified that I flew but i could not spare the time to take the train besides with the troubles in the middle east It is not that straight forward.
Lying on my bed in my rather dingy hotel room I suddenly got a pang of anxiety .....what the hell am I doing here in this crazy place and then I remembered that wise saying that Dave the carbon coach sent me "in a world this sane I'm proud to be mad" no seriously how on earth was I going to build a climate campaign in India.
This country is huge and looking around I think people have more pressing problems like where there next meal is going to come from where to get the money to pay medical bills and send their kids to school etc.... well I was starting to head on a downward spiral so I grabbed some Bach flower remedies had a few squirts did some breathing exercises and promptly fell asleep.
A couple of hours later I'd landed at some plush looking hotel and was downing bloody Marie's and the prospects for the campaign looked far rosier....
Ask your MP for a Climate Change Bill that works
The difference between a 60% and an 80% target is the difference between a Bill which rises to the climate change challenge, and one which simply ducks it.
Only with an 80% emissions reduction target can we hope to prevent the worst effects of climate change.
Environmental Finance, 13 September 2007 - The UK insurance sector today launched a new initiative to tackle climate change and encourage more climate-friendly behaviour among customers ( Video Intro ).
They have agreed to six principles ( PDF ) that will help the insurance sector deal with climate change risk.
The companies have pledged to:
* reduce the environmental impact of their business; and,
Speaking at the launch in London today, Prince Charles said insurers had a crucial role to play in tackling climate change and applauded the companies for achieving an unprecedented level of co-operation on the issue.
Coinciding with the launch of ClimateWise asset manager F&C launched a report ( PDF ), warning that some insurance companies have been slow to act and urgently need to develop climate change strategies.
Insurers must also engage with policy makers and regulators to bring about systemic changes, urged the report, In the Front Line: The Insurance Industry's Response to Climate Change.
Vicki Bakhshi, London-based associate director of governance and sustainable investment at F&C and co-author of the report, said: “Insurers are currently standing at a crossroads.
If they don't act they are in real danger of becoming the victims of climate change, subject to ever increasing risks in their investment portfolios and claims that exceed their projections.
However, it doesn't have to be like that.”
She warned that traditional risk models, which rely on historic data to price forward-looking risk, are likely to become unreliable owing to climate change.
This could significantly affect the profitability of the sector, in which F&C holds investments.
There are a great series of report/articles/papers on climate change and urban development on this page .
Including entire books for free download!
' Air pollution control in the transport sector ' is a publication most interesting to me for its case studies, which i ususally find to be far more interesting than discussion in the abstract.
Atleast for an amateur it is easy to understand the issues through comparison.
' Urban Energy Use and Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Asian Mega-Cities ' is a lot broader than transport policy however it maintains the comparative approach and takes care to analyse the data.
If you can see the numbers then there is a good chance you can realistically appraise the issues for yourself.
As with many issues related to climate change good data is really the start.
The Brazilian government is planning two huge dams on the Madeira River, principal tributary of the Amazon, and a region of mega-biodiversity, with 750 fish and 800 bird species.
The dams were granted preliminary approval in July by Brazilian environmental authorities, even after technical experts of the Brazilian environmental protection service Ibama recommended against licensing the project without new studies being carried out.
Following the model established by the Camp for Climate Action in the UK, which was held for the second time this year, we want to initiate the process of organising a Climate-Action Camp in Germany in 2008.
Just like in the UK we want to create links between the exchange of knowledge (in workshops), self-organised living (in the camp) that minimises our ecological footprint, networking and direct action.
This email and initial call emerged from this year’s Camp for Climate Action in the UK, when several German-speaking people met there who had all, independently of each other, had the idea of organising such a camp in Germany.
We hope to use a first planning meeting either on the last weekend in October or the first weekend in November (26.-28.10.
/ 2.-4.11) somewhere in the geographical centre of Germany to decide how to go on from here.
If you want to attend the meeting, go to http://www.doodle.de/yu8vxh39em9zh7s7 and enter your preferred date – we can then select the most suitable date (provided it doesn’t clash with local organisation).
Both date and location should be agreed on by the end of September.
Climate chaos is a reality.
And there’s not much time left to limit the damage.
Which is exactly why we can’t simply jump into knee-jerk activism that simply reproduces the causes of the problem.
Rather, we need to take profound direct action, without of course excluding people.
We also need grounded analyses of the fundamental structures that serve to highlight the urgent need for social transformation and can communicate information about the underlying causes to a wider audience.
Climate Change is not only an ecological problem, but also a question of the distribution of its consequences.
It thus also poses social questions.
This is why we need immediate and direct action.
Of course, we also need to discuss many other questions, for example the following (a first rough list compiled by us in the camp):
Why are the media suddenly interested in the issue of climate change?
Which interests are pushing this?
Are these interests also our own?
How do we judge the climate change policies pursued until now by environmental NGOs?
What are their effects?
Is it possible to protect the climate in the context of the current socio-economic system?
Or is there a need for radical social change?
Who profits from climate change?
And what does that mean for our actions?
A climate camp could pursue these and many other questions, inspire people to think and act politico-ecologically, it could be a space for experimentation, think-tank and a space to network further common actions.
Of course, we’d first have to decide:
Unfortunately this means that the noble idea of stringent cross party policies developing on climate change is scuppered.
Cameron is getting so much flack that he cant be blamed for quickly getting his head back down behind the paraphet.
This obviouly proves to the left that he was never realy serious, and to the right that this whole saving the planet thing was never a very Tory idea in the first place!
Moral imperative for developed countries to remain focused on ensuring that global temperatures rise no more than two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels (p366/367).
This means the UK must plan for an 80 per cent cut in emissions by 2050 (p370) and include annual milestones in the Climate Change Bill (p372) and include Britain's share of international aviation and shipping emissions in its Climate Change Bill (p370).
Joint implementation measures and Clean Development Mechanisms (carbon trading) should not be used as a way of avoiding domestic reductions in carbon dioxide (p268).
Climate change was on the agenda as the Society of Environmental Journalists gathered last night at Stanford.
Former head of the British Antarctic Survey and new head of the British Science Museum , Prof. Chris Rapley CBE ( bio ), speaks about climate change and the likelyhood of real consequence being more severe than IPCC predictions.
Personally i always took the IPCC as a conservative baseline but this interview is certainly( MP3) worrying stuff and well worth a listen.
Sustainable urban transport is an idea that is relevant to so many problems.
Dependence on foreign oil, air quality, social inclusion, health and fitness, economic growth...all are positively benefited by a move away from private forms of transport.
Home Depot is funding the planting of 300,000 trees in cities across the US to help absorb carbon dioxide
The Campus Climate Challenge calls for all college campuses in the US to reduce their CO2 emissions to zero.
My initial thoughts on the UK govornment response to the climate change bill consultation.
The UK Climate Bill has been undergoing consultation ( consultation questions , response summary ).
The govornments response, or delay, has just been released .
No less than three parliamentary reports feed into the climate bill consultation before the legislation has even entered the law making process!
These reports are by the House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee , the Environment Food and Rural Affairs Committee and a special Joint Committee with both members of the House of Lords and House of Commons.
"Businesses want a clear steer on where climate change policy is going and this bill will help with that," he said.
"But where there are still legitimate questions, where the money is coming from?
If you look at the recent spending review, £7bn to £8bn is going on climate change, while £50bn goes on security, £100bn on health and £100bn on education.
That's not to say those other areas aren't important, just that the level of investment is not yet there to drive the transition to a low carbon economy.
"
We need a carbon treasury, a department with control of all climate related issues.
I think this is more important than a climate bill, which exists only on paper.
A real department with people working towards one goal: a zero carbon britain would be a more solid achivement.
The EAC push for this in thier latest report .
The cross-party Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) does much good work.
If you are interested in what the UK government are doing about climate change and how this could be improved then the EAC is a brilliant place to start.
In their latest report "The structure of Government and the challenge of climate change" ( PDF ) the committee accuse the government of having confused policies, and of failing to grasp the magnitude of the challenge.
Yesterday, i posted two short pieces about what i thought was the link between climate change and wildfires.
One of these pieces featured a video in which the head of the US Fire Service, stated that the number of fires and there magnitude had increased drastically in the last 20 years.
The other piece showed a summary of research into fires that appeared to indicate a stronger than expected link between climate change and wild fires.
But my failure to realise that these people are taking us for saps was corrected just half an hour ago thanks to NewsBusters.
This organisation that fights to remove the liberal bias from the media has release a couple of statements attacking the climate-fire link.
And yes, they are just like GhostBusters but rather than destroying threatening spirits from the afterlife they attempt to destroy threatening news stories than may attack industry vested interests.
The best headline being: "Scientists Disagree With Media Blaming Wildfires on Global Warming".But still the liberal media continue !
What does she know, she is only the Forest Service Chief!
There is more of that sort of nonsense on Grist which has a extensive post on the speculative climate-fire link.
Climate alarmists at Science Daily are also at it, contending that unless we change our ways and live in a cave (or a solar heated house with decent insulation) we will experience these fires at increasing frequency .
"We're showing warming and earlier springs tying in with large forest fire frequencies.
Lots of people think climate change and the ecological responses are 50 to 100 years away.
But it's not 50 to 100 years away -- it's happening now in forest ecosystems through fire.
"
"This is exactly what we've been projecting to happen, both in short-term fire forecasts for this year and the longer term patterns that can be linked to global climate change,"
"The latest models, Neilson said, suggest that parts of the United States may be experiencing longer-term precipitation patterns -- less year-to-year variability, but rather several wet years in a row followed by several that are drier than normal.
"
In California, many severe impacts from climate change are expected, including more deaths duting prologed heat waves, less snowpack in the siera nevada, and more wild fires.
Recent research by climatologists, biologists, geographers, and fire ecologists has revealed that fires in western forests are more strongly linked to climate than was previously thought.
But the specific linkages are as yet poorly understood.
More practically, from a landmanagement perspective, it is not easy to sort through the scientific findings and pick out the most useful ones for planning and on-the-ground management.
The questions have become urgent with successive record-setting fire seasons in 2005 and 2006.
A key study published in Science in August of 2006 used real-time climate records to make a strong link between rising temperatures and increasing wildfire in the northern Rocky Mountains.
The researchers, led by A.L.
(Tony) Westerling of the University of California at Merced, found that warming temperatures and earlier springs are triggering increased wildfire activity in forests in the northern Rockies.
Today I had to give a presentation on the Global Climate |Campaign to the Law faculty of Delhi university something I had been dreading for an entire week.
I absolutely loath public speaking,which does not make me so dissimilar from the average Joe public, apparently when quizzed people in the UK voted getting up and speaking in front of an audience as their number two fear after death.
My talk was followed by a professor going into great depths about the Kyoto protocol, to be honest it was way too technical for me and I switched off.
All in all the students were very enthusiastic about the campaign.
A lot of them previously unfamiliar about climate change are now very keen to spread awareness, so all in all I think the evening was a success.
DSCOVR was a victim of such partisan politics.
Even though it is fully completed at a cost of $100 million, this unique spacecraft remains in a storage box in Maryland, rather than providing critical data on the progress of climate change.
Supporters of the mission have derided these figures; instead saying this effort would cost a mere $229 billion .
For the record, that would still pay for what the US government is spending annually on climate change research for the next 127 years.
Bear in mind that this radical surgery on NASA’s direction was apparently completed without any scientific peer review whatsoever.
It instead came directly from the brain of the perhaps the most unpopular president in US history – and a man who has repeatedly scorned the scientific consensus around climate change.
Lastly robots pose a much smaller risk of contaminating Mars with Earth-based life than astronauts.
Because Mars may harbor indigenous life forms, all the probes sent to the Martian surface have to be carefully sterilized .
Humans on the other hand are repositories of billions of microorganisms in our digestive tract.
If there was ever space suit failure on Mars, not only would the astronaut quickly perish, but the Red Planet would also be hopelessly contaminated with tenacious life from our world.
In this way, sending humans to Mars may irrevocably damage our scientific understanding of the very place we are trying to explore.
The scientific community is very clear about the most urgent priority now facing the planet: climate change.
Yet by diverting billions away from existing climate programs like DSCOVR, George Bush essentially decided that sending humans to Mars for an interplanetary photo-op is more important than tackling global warming.
There is little doubt at this point that George Bush is a fool.
History will only elaborate on that conclusion.
Yet beyond Iraq, the ballooning national debt and the loss of American soft power, perhaps his most shameful legacy will be his intransigent opposition to climate science.
In my last post i mentioned what i consider to be one of the biggest developments in the US on climate policy this year.
A coal fired power station had its application turned down, now that isnt an uncommmon thing of late, the important point was that this refusal was due to carbon dioxide (Co2).
This is the first time that i have heard of anything being denies a permit due to co2 it's a bizarre state of affairs, hopefully we can see more roads, power plants, airports etc., dennied planning permission as they are inately carbon intensive activities.
This is results on the grounds stuff, more positive in my eyes than traded carbon credits of uncertain voracity.
Coal fired power plants are going out of vogue, fast.
There was an opinion survey taken in the US recently that illustrated the current mood of the nation very nicely.
This is some optomistic reading !
Go on, spoil yourself, give the latest climate science a mis and check out the changing political landscape.
"I believe it would be irresponsible to ignore emerging information about the contribution of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to climate change and the potential harm to our environment and health if we do nothing," said Bremby.
"Denying the Sunflower air quality permit, combined with creating sound policy to reduce carbon dioxide emissions can facilitate the development of clean and renewable energy to protect the health and environment of Kansans," said Bremby.
Together the plants would have produced 11 million tons of carbon dioxide annually, nearly as much as a group of eight Northeastern states hope to save by 2020 through a mandatory cap-and-trade program they plan to impose.
The attorneys general from those states had written a letter opposing the permit.
Nobel peace prize for Al Gore in his fight against climate change one day, people thrown in jail for the same thing the next.
●Reporting on GHG emissions is taken as guide of environmental management systems which tend to be good when overall management is good.
Not reporting GHG emissions accurately or at all is not a good sign to investors.
The 2007 Nobel Peace Prize was jointly awarded today to former US vice president Al Gore and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Norwegian Nobel committee announced in Oslo.
It said they had been awarded the prize "for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change.
" Gore, a vice president to Bill Clinton and failed candidate for the White House in 2000, has reinvented himself as a champion of climate change with his 2006 Oscar-winning documentary An Inconvenient Truth.
The IPCC, a UN body comprised of about 3000 atmospheric scientists, oceanographers, ice specialists, economists and other experts, is the world's top scientific authority on global warming and its impact.
The peace laureates will receive a gold medal, a diploma and 10 million Swedish kronor ($A1.7 million) to be shared between them.
Hopefully this award will do something meaningful, namely putting climate change firmly on the agenda of US presidential candidates.
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Rajendra Pachauri, who chairs the U.N. panel on climate change that won the Nobel Peace Prize along with Al Gore, said on Friday he was overwhelmed by the news.
The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change this year made the strongest ever link between mankind's activities and global warming -- gaining widespread publicity around the world.
I recieved an email asking me to highlight a video about unsustainable transport and climate change (unbranded but clearly by Virgin).
In fact i get paid £10 to post this...but hopefully you will agree it was worth sharing without the sweetner!
These companies where targeted for there hugely distructive role in Agrofuels (a.k.a biofuels) more information on this 'solution' to climate change here .
When the people lead the leaders will follow...so said somone famous...and a girl i met at a climate change meeting in London some time back.
Well, it looks like its time for the global political 'followers' to get there running shoes on!
Large majorities around the world believe ( report ) that human activity causes global warming and that strong action must be taken, sooner rather than later, in developing as well as developed countries, according to a BBC World Service poll of 22,000 people in 21 countries.
An average of eight in ten (79%) say that "human activity, including industry and transportation, is a significant cause of climate change.
"
Nine out of ten say that action is necessary to address global warming.
A substantial majority (65%) choose the strongest position, saying that "it is necessary to take major steps starting very soon.
"
However it's not just city folk who are worried about climate change, thanks to the nwfr for the survey results:
77 percent of New Hampshire Sportsmen agree the U.S. should be a world leader in addressing global warming.
66 percent of New Hampshire Sportsmen agree global warming is an urgent problem requiring immediate action.
Is global warming the number one election issue?
Debrief and Planning: The Scotland Neighbourhood of the Climate Camp
Let's keep up the fantastic and powerful energy for action on climate
In order to plan for Dec 8th a planning meeting is being held, anyone with an interest in climate change who wants to get involved and make this happen in scotland rather than taking the treck to london.
Come along!
Why Climate Change is not being reported in mainstream Indian media....
Difficult to give a short answer.
It is not only climate change only, Indian
Indian media mentions climate change only when they need to report
building.
On the other hand, reporting the politics of climate change
from reporting complex events.
There is also another problem... Climate
Rice is the staple diet for 40% of the worlds population.
Effects of climate change on rice are therefore of great significance.
As with all outcomes from climate models when we are looking at precipitation, temperature, and other factors, along with non-climatic factors the conclusions are not definitive or precise.
However, the heterogeneity of the situation is significant of itself, and indeed is perhaps the most important aspect of the models.
With more than 2-3 degrees warming all the trends are negative and the yields of many crops in many areas are declining, before that point there are a lot of areas making gains, and a lot loosing out.
This is not a situation that farmers are going to easily adapt to and large scale migrations from one area to another will be significant without the yield necessarily decreasing.
But how do we balance our need for large quantities of secure, low carbon electricity with the impact on biodiversity and local communities?
Is a publicly led and financed project the only way to protect habitats and ensure long-term success?
- The UK climate bill still omits the emissions from the aviation industry from its calculations - which makes the whole sum nonsensical.
It seems that recently i have been doing both a lot less writing and a lot more meeting, protesting, organising.
I`m aware that this dosent translate well to this blog.
I will still try and talk about key issues in climate change with whatever spare time i have.
This years big topic seems to be high food prices.
This is a vital topic and I'm keen to have in covered in depth at this years Camp for Climate Action.
I will be doing a post on this at the next possible opportunity.
On the supply side there are both short term issues such as bad weather in some parts of thw world, and long term issues such as loss of soil qaulity, water table depletion, crop damage due to climate change and shifitng agricultural regions also due to climate change .
The relative importance of these factors, now and into the future is very difficult to predict although it is likely that they are all leading in one direction; towards agricultural stress.
The Global Climate Campaign is the name of a project initiated by Campaign against Climate Change .
The focus of this campaign is an International Day of Climate Action that is planned to coincide with the annual UN climate talks.
One reason for it's success is the broad nature of the coallition building that has been carried out; the general message has been if you support a global and leaglly binding climate change deal then join us on this day and be part of something bigger than any of our individual efforts.
The Global Climate Campaign is a growing movement with representation in many, many countries, but perhaps not yours?
If you would like to add your group to the list of those supporting the call bellow then email the campaign office via the website:

National Climate Camp Meeting: London 10th-11th May
On Tuesday Friends of the Earth and Stop Climate Chaos held a public meeting at Friends Meeting House on Euston Road.
A large crown turned out to hear Environment Secretary Hillary Benn and Environment spokesmen for both the Lib-Dem's and Tories talk about there position on the Climate Bill which has just passed the House of Lords and is heading back to the Commons.
Hillary seemed reasonable if not visionary; thats a shame really becuase we need a visionary to deal with an urgen challenge rather than a large problem.
Jo Abess has written a review of the proceedings over at her climate college .
The main reason for mentioning this event, wasnt to highlight the great work that FOE are doing, but to share my experiance of leafleting at the event.
I was there to highlight the next national organisational meeting for the Climate Camp.
There was a lot of support for this despite the numerous campaigns that had congregated to reach others concerned about climate change.
There was just one attitutde that bothered me, people expected that the climate camp would exist and that they could just turn up for the week.
This is not a f%7("~g festival!
It dosent just appear, it is created by all those who come together to make it happen; it is a free event with donattions for some services requested, the real price of addmitance is involvement!
Having moved from not that near Aberdeen to the edge of London my options of getting practically involved in climate change related activities have increased dramatically.
The new issue is priorities.
I am strongly supportive of the work being carried out by many groups such as Campaign against Climate Change, Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, Rising Tide, Plane Stupid, The Camp for Climate Action, HACAN and the Campaign against Urban 4*4's.
In fact i have recently been along to events by many of these groups.
Living just outside the centre of London however means added transport costs and time for every event attended so despite knowing people and enjoying the social side of these groups i`m going to focus on the work of the Climate Camp.
I'm also going to stay involved with anti-Heathrow events as this is an issue with a lot of local support.
Finally, i`m still keen to get involved with Plane Stupid.
I think that two groups with regular commitments, and occasional support to the anti-aviation campaigns is a manageable level of commitment.
I`m also thinking about creating my own campaign which will not be ostensibly environmental but rather will focus on broas economic and social questions that are of concern to most citizens.
We all know that climate change isn't a top tear issue for many people; well it is possible to move the mountain to mohammed.
In other words we can find a lot of smart policies to address that both fight climate change and improve peoples lives in a way that enables an openness and generosity required for support of climate change policies.
I want to develop this in some detail and possibly build the group at a the Cimate Camp .
When time magazine first did a climate change front page with a lonely polar bear on thin ice, it was clear to all that the debate on the reality of climate change was coming to an end in the US.
Indeed this is not a debate that the US presidential candidates would have.
In this new political atmosphere the media is moving ahead with the discussion, focusing on the possibility of green collar jobs and a weak US economy and on the potential of lower oil imports by ramping up renewables.
The largest oil-related environmental disaster in the world - Chevron dumped over 18 billion gallons of toxic wastewater in the Ecuadorian Amazon.
Now they are trying to hide their disaster and launching public relations campaigns about "human energy".
The truth is Chevron's actions cause death, cancer, birth defects, miscarriages and the worst oil related destruction of the Amazon.
They damage is estimate at up to $16billion.
Chevron can't hide its actions any longer and should pay up.

Chevron is a big bad oil company operating in the neo-liberal global trade climate of the 21st century.
Multinationals can currently get away with a lot; globalisation of capital has outstripped globalisation of government and regulation.
Raping the planet is all part of the game, not doing so would be bad business unless the laws prevent it, or you can place compliance as a PR cost.
Now his project has gone global with 350.org ; the 350 refers to 350ppm CO2e , a concentration of greenhouse gasses significantly lower than most policy wonks are talking about but a level at which we may have to stabilise concentrations to prevent run-away climate change.
The project differs from the Global Climate Campaign (GCC) in having a very specific outcome and a more significant central organisation; this greater specificity and centrality will no doubt enable certain activities and engage certain new people not already reached.
The more ad hoc GCC however, worked as a de facto umbrella group and the day international day of climate action, a simple unifying element.
It will be interesting to see how these two activist elements work together to raise the profile and increase the cohesiveness of the global climate change protest movement.

From this Tuesday (15th April) all UK forecourts will be required by law to sell only fuel which is blended with 2.5% biofuel.
This will have devastating consequences on climate, carbon sinks, food prices and human rights, with people being violently evicted from their land.
EU targets are set to increase to 10% by 2020.
If you like, dress as a tree to be deforested or an April (bio)fool!
Bring along drums and instruments.
Please contact me if you want to discuss any of this or you would like an information sheet of key messages to get across.
Deforestation, peatland destruction and nitrogen fertiliser use mean that agrofuels are actually worse for the climate than fossil fuel.
Paul Crutzen (nobel prize-winner) suggests that rapeseed biodiesel is up to 70% worse for climate change than ordinary fossil diesel (even though it's grown in the UK so involves no deforestation or peatland destruction) due to nitrous oxide emissions from nitrogen fertiliser which is a 300x more damaging greenhouse gas than CO2.
IPS have just released a report into the World Banks involvement in carbon markets.
It's a bit of an odd one really, they are both funding the most polluting and destructive practices around, and projects to reduce the level of carbon.
They proffit handsomely in the latter!
“World Bank: Climate Profiteer,” a new report from the Institute for Policy
Lester Brown (Plan B; 1.0.
2.0, 3.0) has an interesting article doing the rounds in the green blogosphere in which he outlines the tough year that coal has had in the US.
The same will be true if it tries some kind of resurgence here in the UK.
I`m certainly going to do what i can in resisting such an appauling idea.
The progress made so far in the US, if it holds, could set a major precident for coal in the developed world; and moves the whole world towards a situations where coal without ccs comes to be seen in the right manner, namely hugely irresponsible, and just not something that is the done thing.
We will have to set this example and help provide alternatives in the growing Asian giants are to avoid this environmentally costly and dangerously polluting form of power.

The wind power sector offers a great example of economic growth and environmental protection going hand in hand.
Porche are suing the Mayor of London, Ken Livingston, for imposing a higher congestion charge on polluting vehicles.
In the process of this Urban Dinosaur hunt we had quite a few positive comments and no antagonism.
We where there for some time and i only noticed one potential customer taking a look through the windows.
Interestingly, one investor (we where in a very pricy area of London) stated that ii am very right wing' but just couldnt understand why the govornment hadent introduced 75MPG requirements as 'we have the technology'.
It's a funny old world.
On Saturday the 5th April Campaign against Climate Change staged a photo opportunity outside parliament.
We went along with giant prop loophole and model jumbo jet to make our point; aviation is flying through the climate bill, leaving a tattered rag where a serious climate bill used to be.
In fact it is both Aviation and Shipping.

Other factors such as soil degredation, decline of water qaulity and the effects of climate change on global agriculture through shifting weather patterns and drought, are all likely to add to these pressures in the medium to long term.
With widespread deforestation being drivin by demand for biofuel crops, this is starting to look like a bad idea!
This increases the pressure on land and in places like Brazil and Indonesia this increases the pressure on the rain forest and other surviving biodiverse ecosystems.
Clearance for palm oil plantations is now the biggest driver behind deforestation in Indonesia and an increase in the price of soy (caused by increased demand) is seen as the main cause of the recent huge increase in the rate of deforestation in Brazil.
Even if agrofuels are produced from, say, “certifiably sustainable” rapeseed in Europe this can have knock-on effects – it means there is less rapeseed available to produce cooking oils and foodstuffs and this results in a massively increased demand for Indonesian palm oil to fill the gap.

When the draft climate bill came out i stated that it had a loophole big enough to fly a 747 through.
Well, that is the theme of a protest at 10 Downing Street this Saturday 5th April at 2pm.
This might seem more technical than 'no third runway' but if aviation is included in the bill; and every sane person agrees that this is logical, then we will have a lot less flights to worry about.
This ammendment is both key and counter to the direction that labour has seemed to be going.
Lets make them pay for this failure, and hope for a change of course.
Al Gore is all over the news again, and as far as i`m concerned thats a good thing.
This time it is his project known as the Alliance for Climate Protection that is making the news for it's big money ad campaign to build momentum behind action on climate change.
Cathy Zoi who is heading up the Alliance for Climate Protection is a former Clinton administration aide on enviornmental issues.
She spoke to the aspen institute about the urgency of the issue and the Alliance's plans at a forum last week ( part 1 , part 2 ).
This was a facinating forum, judging by the speakers, who, incidentely included Andrew Revkin...perhaps explaining how he wrote such an informative article.
Videos from the forum here .
The huge expansion in aviation, of which the Heathrow expansion is the flagship component, is totally incompatible with winning the battle against climate catastrophe, totally incompatible in fact, with the Government’s own Climate Bill.
This is a battle we need to win – and a battle we can win !
We want to see people coming from all over the country to join the tens of thousands who will be protesting in West London.
We want a massive show of force to make sure we win our first big victory in the war to redirect Britain towards a low carbon future.
Come and be part of it – join a Spring Carnival of Resistance to the Third Runway, Airport Expansion and the insanity of government decisions that would lock us into climate catastrophe.
Recently several people have made the case for an emergency agenda on climate change.
Moving this whole issue back from 2050 to 2008.
The govornment keep wondering why people wont change their behaviour--isnt the rehtoric strong enought!?
But that is preciesly the point, thegovornment has done nothing to suggest that the war on climate change is infact even real.
Where are the troops, where are the resources for us to take this on together.
In short,.
where is the leadership that would encourage solidarity?
"The arguments for running down Heathrow have nothing to do with the contribution of aircraft to global warming, which is so small as to be completely irrelevant.
"
That is an interesting statement.
The Tyndall Centre for Global Climate Change have a different take:
This is the pre-eminent climate change research centre in the UK and possibly the world, giving a briefing suitable for journalists and the general public (Briefing Paper 84.
PDF). I wonder if you would be so good as to clarify these facts in writing?
I have recently highligted a great number of studies showing problems with biofuels.
From competition with food crops for land and water to encouraged deforestation, fertiliser usage and ecological impacts from pesticides.
However, there are reasons for optimism that biofuels have potential, this is perticularly true when we talk about vehicles with 100mpg rather than 20-30.
Perticulalry cellulosic ethanol seems to be the way to go, this is a process development challenge.
the roof of parliament because the democratic process had been corrupted.
"The aviation industry had taken full advantage of a weak prime minister to get the Heathrow consultation fixed.
"It does not even consider global warming despite everything (Prime Minister Gordon) Brown has said about the environment and despite the massive impact aviation has on the climate.
"
It is all very well framing a consultation in a local manner if that consultation is for local needs and has local impacts.
Heathrow is broadly opposed by residents and is often talked about in terms of Britain's economic competitiveness.
Heathrow's expansion rests on national strategic issues and this is an area that i would like to comment on.
Since the Aviation White Paper was released a series of reports by the environmental audit commission, SDC, AEF, IPPR and others have broadly condemned the strategy.
Not, it must be noted, based on their collective views on what government policy should be but rather based on what the government state to be its policy.
Government climate change policy is in direct opposition to it's plans for airport expansion.
Predict and provide is a widely used description for the governments aviation policy; this is not a balance it is a decision to prioritise putative economic gains over environmental outcomes, such equations seem antiquated, to put it mildly, in a post-Stern Review political climate.
I believe that this discordance is widely recognised in government.
The key point i wish to highlight is that we can't magic away this problem by invoking the EU ETS.
People will make various arguments for this, from local concerns such as traffic and loss of whole communities to considerations of Britain's future carbon budget and how this will be allocated between sectors.
As this consultation is tilted towards local consideration I will focus on the latter.
The only way we can get around this is by limiting aviation expansion.
The government cannot be serious about climate change and serious about building runways.
Tough emissions reductions targets are not achievable in the UK if aviation continues to be subsidised, facilitated and given preferential treatment when all other sectors are expected to contribute significant carbon emissions reductions.
Climate Code Red: The case for a sustainability emergency.
Climate change is a tricky issue to deal with as we all know.
Scaring people to change behaviour doesn't work, big changes require large commitments but how can these be driven if not with the urgency of fear?
Marketing companies are desperately trying to find a way to make climate change mitigation sexy...well, good luck with that!
The general confusion tends to lead to conservatism in a time when we need radical change.
Finding our way through this is going to be tough, one point that i think we need to take is that different types of communication are needed in different contexts.
If trying to sell 'green' products or services, it is a moot point as to if the green attributes should even take a high place in the marketing.
When dealing with government programs, i looks increasingly like a rallying call is required, a well resourced, broad and serious attempt to cut carbon emissions on a short time frame.
If we stop talking about 50 years and start talking about 5 years with regular targets for society then perhaps we can get there.
Camaraderie is a way to make people feel that they can have an impact, moving a whole society, as if on a serious mission.
The oft asked question 'why don't people get it, they just don't see how serious this is' has a surprisingly simple answer.
No one is treating this as an emergency, if we have a war on climate change then where are the troops?
It's well known that human behaviour is contextual so why should people take the extreme measure of not flying or not buying a car or spending a significant fraction of income on green home improvements.
If government starts taking serious actions, funding programmes in a proportionate manner and allowing large numbers of people to access them then we just might kindle a 'climate change war spirit'.
This kind of argument has been made by the Breakthrough Institute who are promoting a government led 'global warming preparedness act'.
More recently EcoEquity has produced a report calling for a climate change emergency agenda to be created.
The Better World Fund works to improve the relationship between the US and the UN.
An interesting new project that they are working on-- On Day One --aims to set the agenda for the next US president on climate change.
Go along and make your own suggestions for addressing the issue that matter to you.
I suggested taxing pollution more and income less.
Income tax would be
a carbon tax.
This 'green tax switch' is one no brainer that every country
In their book Break Through , Nordhaus and Schellenburger make the case for what they term "the politics of possibility" an alternative conceptual box to replace environmentalism.
One of the primary outcomes of accepting this proposal is the need to take a more active interest in social issues, on the understanding that environmentalism is post-material, people will find it hard to support change and perticulalry environmental protection if they their basic needs are not met.
For this reason I will be posting from time to time about significant developments that impact on peoples rights and sense of security.
The phrase 'flexible labour marker' is particularly Orwellian, it's real meaning is insecurity.
It seems quite unlikely that a anything other than environmental damage can result from a nation with a million extra people without the rights--the security--in employment that the rest of the nation enjoys.
The EU has had an emissions trading scheme for some time, the first revision was absurdly overallocated so the price of credits fell through the floor.
We will have and wait to see how this develops, one of the major changes going forward is the movement towards a auction based system.
The system is also becoming broader.
With the US likely to adopt a similar system soon it's important to take a look at what works and what dosent.
The New America Foundation, the Pew Centre for Global Climate Change and the World Resources Institute have produced a series of 10 (6 currently available) detailed videos looking at every aspect of effective emissions regulation.

In the few areas where the EU does speak with one voice--e.g., the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the World Trade Organization (WTO)--the United States has lost traction in dealing with its European allies on anything resembling a bilateral basis.
Frequently, it has found itself pitted against an institution that has predetermined its position and is intent on morally opposing American policy.
Something similar has happened with the idea of 'climate security' the connection between climate change and conflict seems to be quite a lively topic of discussion that i have largely missed.
This is one of many kinds of green tax switch that bennefit both the poor and the environment.
Sounds good to me, a safer world from military agression and climate change.
The 'Key Concepts' of this plan include:
The influence of such 'frames' is vast, Herman Daly suggests that many of the flaws he points to in Limits to Growth (i.e deforestation is classed as income, infinte capital can flow from near zero resources, exponential growth can be sustained) have not been examined closely due to a pre-analytic vision (frame) that excludes the flaws from the realm of critical thought.
Noam Chomsky explains this by means of an example.
Q: Why is it that the US so rarely criticised for it's foreing politics and role in conflicts?
A: By carrying out a literature search it was found that the US media have adopted 'peace process' for 'current US policy with regards to a given group of nations' over many years the US was never reported as being 'against the peace process' as the words 'peace process' by defenition exclude this possibility!
These two ideas, of questions being influence, and false pre-suppositions being built into these questions, in part explain the way propaganda works.
These issues face green campaigners as a barage, the climate change conversation is filled with so many questions based on false propositions that straightening out the mess is quite a minefield.
This minefield can be avoided
Joshua Busby of the Council on Foreign Relations authors a November 2007 report about Climate Change and National Security.
I`m uncertain at best about how he frames the issues, but if you are interested in how Al Gore won the Nobel Peace Prize then this is part of your explanation.
Climate change could lead to a heatwave in the south-east of England killing 3,000 people by 2012, a Department of Health report says.
So given the option I would rather protest at the Department of Transport when aviation expansion is proposed, not the company (BAA) that runs the airport; and i would rather protest at the department for the environment when coal expansion threatens, not at the company headquaters.
We don't have the resources to go after every polluting company, busineses are going to teach themselves about running thier busineses more efficiently, what no other group of society is going to do is bring corporate interests in line with community interest through relavent regulation.
On Febuary 14th the third gathering of institutional investors took place at UN Headquaters in New York City.
The "Investor Summit on Climate Risk" was a joint venture between climate risk investment group CERES , the UN Foundation and the UN Fund for International Partnership .
The Summit will focus on how investors can advance solutions to climate change, with a particular emphasis on the benefits of energy efficiency.
The Summit aims to help investors

At the confernece around $20 trillion worth of assets where represented.
A subsection of the group, with assets valued at 1.75$ Trillion signed up to a Climate Action Plan produced by CERES .
There was also growth in the companies who, although dodging the solid commitments of the climate action plan have the Investor Network in Climate Risk now involves companies with $5 trillion of investment.
Since London announced it's climate change strategy , a strange thing has happened, actions to implement that strategy have been taken!
That is perhaps only strage if you are used to national politics and broken promises.
In London Ken Livingston is putting on a good display of what can be done.
This strategy is getting most of it's funding from the newly announced congestion charge increase for large cars .
The idea of increasing charges on cars that emmit large qauntities of co2 is harldy likely to be unpopular amongst environmentalists.
However, it is problamatic in the sense that a congestion charge is being used for two policy goals: reducing the number of cars and supporting certain types of cars.
Local charges, perticularly in a city like London can have an influence on demand for types of cars but things would be done most effectively by having national policies to discriminate between cars based on pollution, and local charges to deal with demand.
One of the first podcasts that I ever subscribed to was TheWatt , a cleantech and climate change podcast.

The 5 stages of climate change denial
Pan Yue, deputy director of State Administration of Environmental Protection
"The introduction of economic policy environment can not wait!
We should release several policies within one year, set up major pilot projects within two years, and create a fundamental framework for an environmental economic system in China within four years.."
The State Environmental Protection Administration Pan Yue, deputy director in the 9th Twelfth "Green China Forum" that outlined China's economic policy environment timetable.
Forum on Pan proposed for the first time a new environment of economic policy framework and the road map, and called on the macroeconomic sector and professional sectors together environmental and economic policy research pilot.
First, the green tax.
To the development, conservation, the use of environmental resources of taxpayers units and individuals, according to the environmental resource development and use, pollution, destruction and the extent of protection levy or relief, the implementation of environment-friendly behavior tax preferential policies on the environment unfriendly act , and establish a basis for the amount of pollution emitted by the direct pollution taxes, indirect pollution based on the products of environmental taxes.
Second, environmental charges.
Raising the level of charges, in the resource price reform to take full account of environmental factors, pricing and fees to promote energy-saving reduction.
Fourth, it is ecological compensation.
This policy is not just an environmental and economic needs, but also political and strategic needs.
It is necessary to improve the developed areas of less developed regions, urban to rural, affluent crowd on the poor, on the lower reaches of the upper reaches, beneficiaries of the injured party, the "two high" industries of environmental protection industries to the financial transfer payment methods ecological compensation policy .
(translation not good enough for me...perhaps reperation in rural areas for resources required in cities?
An attempt at stabilising social tensions using the logic of environmental rights?
)
Fifth, it is trading.
The use of market forces to achieve environmental protection objectives and optimize the environmental capacity of the allocation of resources, reduce the total cost of pollution control, and mobilize the enthusiasm of polluters to prevent water pollution.
(water qaility credits in a market system, i believe the US currently uses this kind
Sixth, green trade.
For the developed countries more and more green trade barriers, China must change the simple pursuit of volume growth to the neglect of environmental capacity and resource constraints of the development model, the import and export trade and balance the interests of environmental protection at home and abroad.
Seventh, Green insurance.
Environmental liability insurance which most representative, on the one hand, by insurance companies and unforeseen pollution compensation to the victims of the government and enterprises to reduce the pressure on the one hand and enhance the market mechanism to force the supervision of enterprises sewage.
(I believe that this is a requirement for environmental insurance, insurance on a large scale is often only obtanable on the conditions of an insurance company such as monitoring and independent assesment of pollution risks, this gives central govornment a way to introduce monitoring of business on business)
Pan said that any one sector and macroeconomic environment with the professional competence to lead the departments are willing to implement economic policy environment, Environmental Protection Agency will meet to be willing to do supporting roles.
Arguements on climate change, seem to have receeded from the mainstream.
However, some of the premises used have not been publically discredited.
For example the case for action was hindered by arguments based on certainty of the science, we have largely stopped having these arguments as the science is solid: we have a problem.
However, there are still error bars around various climate impacts, a good example being sea level rise.
So this sort of argument will raise it's ugly head again.
What is needed is a more clear eyed look at the decison being made.
Who has the right to decide weather a certain level of climate change is dangerous?
What is the moral case for developed nations cutting emissions slowly, while the risk is placed on the inhabitants of low island developing states?
Climate change arguments are widely distorted in the media, a whole range of arguments need to be grounded in a moral framework.
So many of the cliched arguments are based on premises which if applied to every day situations would bee seen as farsical.
The Rock Ethics Institute at Penn State University is looking at these issues in detail.
The lovely Michael O'Leary wants a recession to kill off some competitors and put concerns about our children's welfare on the back burner.
Meanwhile, two studies in the journal "Science" confirm once again that putting the entire biosphere in our petrol tanks is a tad foolish.
The Pew Centre for Global Climate Change has just released it's latest report into the deployment of carbon caputure and storage technology.
Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a method for burning coal whilst prevnting the carbon from entering the atmosphere.
That atleast is it's technical ability.
It does have broader political implications; the coal industry which in the USA provides around half of all electricity, and in China provides around 80%, is a powerful constituency.
In a democracy, so the theory goes, people have the power, but i reality concentrations of capital are a rival centre of power often in oposition to the people.
CCS has the potential to placate this group, and turn coal production into part of the political solution not a source of fearce opposition.
To those who believe that we should take on this fight, i respectuflly disagree and hope that we can do the most important thing in the power sector.
Namely, preventing coal plants without carbon capture being built so that we can then focus on the many other problems.
I explain the basics of the technology in earlier posts (link bellow) the take home message from the IPCC special report on CCS is that capacity isn't the issue.
Saline aquifers, coal beds and depleted oil reserves have ample capacity to use this technology for more than 5o years.
The key problems are efficiency loss (some of the coal energy is used to store the fumes), cost (at current levels of development this may be twice that of standard coal) and the related issue of rolling out the technology with sufficient rapidity to make an impact.
The use of water for this technolgy may well also be a limiting factor locally.
"This paper discusses one possible avenue to accelerate deployment of carbon dioxide capture and sequestration (CCS) technologies: use of a special-purpose CCS Trust Fund.
Trust funds can be an attractive policy option because, if properly designed, they can raise significant amounts of funds from non-governmental sources and can ensure that those paying into the fund benefit from the program.
A CCS Trust Fund financed, for example, through fees on coal-based or fossil fuel-based electricity generation may have a role in reducing CO2 emissions from power plants because it could:
"Possibly the scariest outcome from Super Tuesday is that the top three candidates to become president all support a cap-and-trade approach to global warming.
Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.), Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y.) and Barack Obama (D-Ill.) are all smart and capable leaders, but they also have been completely engrossed in White House politics for more than a year.
Hopefully when they have the time to examine recent evidence they will reject their current proposals, which include costly carbon limits that will harm our economy without positively affecting the climate at all.
"
It is facinating to me that McCain is the leading republican candidate.
This happened in part due to two major endorcements, those of Gov.
Arnold Scwazenegger in California and Gov.
Charlie Crist of Florida.
Both of these men have been leaders on climate change, and infact Scwaxenegger's endorcement was given at a solar power factory!
It's amazing how radical this sounds to those of us who are used to govornment incramentalism on Climate Change.
We are constantly hearing of moving towards fleet wide efficiency targets that are relatively modest...why not just make this simple and ban inneficient cars.
This way there will be far greater incentive for innovating in the sports car market; that performance wont be available with petrol anymore electric and hydrogen will have to be seriously invested in.
The Institute of Policy Studies has just released a report comparing US expenditure on military and climate defence.
Needles to say that the US is spending vast sums on arms and military wages while spending virtually nothing on preventing the destabilisation of the global climate, which promises to cause mass migration, resource conflict and a wide range of other malodies.
"We will devote 50 times as much to arming the rest of the world as to helping it prepare for and avoid global climate catastrophe.
"
Protestors, from climate action group Rising Tide Newcastle, are locked onto machinery, stopping the conveyor belts that carry coal to Bayswater’s furnaces in protest against the Federal Government’s failure to stop Australia’s greenhouse pollution rising.
“Australia’s greenhouse pollution is still increasing and our addiction to coal-fired power is the main cause.
We are here because every day we hesitate, we are killing the Great Barrier Reef.”
In 2006/07, Bayswater Power Station created approximately 14 million tonnes of carbon dioxide pollution, making it equal greatest single source of greenhouse pollution in the country and among the top 100 polluting power stations in the world.
“The nation and the world are watching and we will not get another chance.
The people that are here today are parents and grandparents, professionals and tradespeople.
We are demanding a commitment from the Government today: Australia’s greenhouse emissions must start dropping from 2010, we must do whatever it takes to save the Barrier Reef from wipe-out and the world from devastating runaway climate change.”
The fight for the climate is far from over; the need for people to protest our failure to reverse greenhouse pollution is greater than ever.
It’s easy enough to set a target that’s 42 years away, but we don’t stand a rapidly melting snowball’s chance of achieving it if the government give the green light to new coal fired power stations (7 are in the planning stages, with E.ON’s new Kingsnorth being first up) and keep dishing out subsidies to new coal mines.
Coal is the dirtiest fuel there is, so while the government continues with business-as-usual through the last 100 months we have to make a difference on climate change, we call for 48 hours of action against new coal – now!
This day of action is supported by The Camp for Climate Action, Rising Tide, Plane Stupid and Campaign against Climate Change.
Huge energy company E.ON AG (EOA.DE)are going around careers fairs stating that 'climate change is a central issue for us not just something to tack on' meanwhile they are pushing for the first new coal plant in the uk for more than 20 years!

The UK Climate Bill will be the first legally binding national piece of legislation on carbon emissions.
Initiated due to a lobbying effort by UK environmental organisation friends of the earth the Bill has since recieved strong support both by opposition parties and by a whole range of environmental and development organisations including the Stop Climate Chaos coallition.
Initially the target proposed was a 60% cut by 2050 based on 1990 levels.
This target was assumed to exclude international aviation and shipping.
The official reasoning behind this has always been the difficulty of allocating carbon emissions to international travel and the lack of global agreement.
In reality it comes down to considerations of national economic competativeness.
Whatever the reasoning, this approach has been continuously assailed by large sections of politically active society.
These attacks have been strengthened by both a supportive stance from opposition parties and the govornment wish to base targets rhetorically at least on the latest climate science.
Clearly having loopholes of any significant size is not compatible with policies based on the urgent neeed for emissions reductions; the potential lack of any progress on uk emissions if aviation is excluded has regularly attained prominance.
Now at last it looks like international aviation and shipping are to be included within, or considered by, the climate bill.
We will have to wait for the debate to conclude this afternoon before the exact wording is known but at present it looks like good news for the UK's commitment to reducing climate change.
The climate bill was also toughened up recently to achieve 80% rather than 60% cuts.
The other issue which has been hotly contested is the ability of the UK govornment to use the EU emissions trading scheme to achieve its targets.
In other words does the UK really have to reduce emissions 80% or can it simply pay for other nations to take the low carbon route.
From a practical point of view this is a very important decision as all the uk climate campaigns on unabated coal, aviation expansion and road building, will be a lot easier to fight if we can show flat contradiction rather than simply the added expense of emissions permits.
At the moment there is a great deal of uncertainty about the degree of EU ETS credit purchasing that is going to be allowed.
Other interesting ammendments include proposals that the climate change and energy department set limits on co2/Kwh that new power generation facilities produce, provisions for companies opporating inside the uk to disclose there carbon footprint and allowances to be made for unions to have a workplace environmental spokesperson.
Clauses covering the civic estate are also included.
All of these ammendements can be followed on the Climate Bill page .
From the words of John Hutton at the Labour party conference it looked like labour where going to go ahead with new coal.
That looks less certain with Ed Milliband in charge of the newly created department for energy and climate change.
But the question remains, why would they do that?
Externally they seem likely to present this dastardly deed as a sensible energy policy that will benefit the UK as it exports the newly developed CCS technology to china.
This is arrogant, most new plants in China are more efficient than ours and Chinese development skills are growing fast.
It also seems to be countered by there lack of urgency.
What lack of urgency I hear you say, didn't Malcolm Wicks say that we use CCS or loose that battle against climate change ?
That sounds urgent.
Well, unfortunately it looks like that was just publicly acceptable rhetoric.
But in that case what are the government doing?
I`m afraid they are doing exactly the same thing as they are trying to do with the UK Climate Bill.
They want all of the climate bill quotas to be subsumed within the EU ETS.
They are trying to make coal or no coal, climate bill or no climate bill, irrelevances.
They want to rely entirely on the EU ETS.
They are deeply rooted to the free market doctrine that has been imploding in the financial markets over recent weeks.
The only question is where will this money be spent.
Some of us believe that repowering our carbon fuel based energy sector, and carrying out massive energy efficiency retrofits should be high on that agenda.
Housing efficiency spending makes particular sense in terms of jobs creation, cutting energy bills and fighting climate change.
If elected, Obama would be the first president to group emissions blamed for global warming into a category of pollutants that includes lead and carbon monoxide.
Obama's rival in the presidential race, Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona, has not said how he would treat CO2 under the act.
Placing heat-trapping pollutants in the same category as ozone may lead to caps on power-plant emissions and force utilities to use the most expensive systems to curb pollution.
The move may halt construction plans on as many as half of the 130 proposed new U.S. coal plants.
The president may take action on new rules immediately upon taking office, said David Bookbinder, chief climate counsel for the Sierra Club.
Environment groups including the Sierra Club and Natural Resources Defense Council will issue a regulatory agenda for the next president that calls for limits on CO2 from industry.
Ed Miliband is the first climate change and energy secretary
Climate change and energy secretary Ed Miliband said the current 60% target would be replaced by a higher goal.
Mr Miliband told MPs the government accepted all the recommendations of the report from Lord Turner's Committee on Climate Change .
"The CCC also advised that the UK’s climate change strategy, and the 80% target, should include international aviation and shipping.
" ( press release, pdf )
The figure comes from adding the value of the various services that forests perform, such as providing clean water and absorbing carbon dioxide.
The study, headed by a Deutsche Bank economist, parallels the Stern Review into the economics of climate change.
The good bit is when the council spokespeople get started,some nice ideas some hilarious non-secateurs and diversions.
A couple of my favourite arguments where, firstly, that air pollution models aren't accurate but from current modeling a couple of roads looked likely to be impacted in an unacceptable manner.
Not good, you would think, however the boroughs already poor air quality comes to the rescue.
We are told that since this level of air pollution isn't anomalous it is nothing to be worried about!
However the pice de resistance was a consultant brought in to talk about the carbon management plant the airport where working on.
There was talk of the fact city businessmen who mainly use the airport where coming in by tube--so that's green, the airport operators where doing ISO14001, which i`m sure you all know is a sustainable management code, and at one point i expected him to tell us about the aerating faucets they used to save energy and water.
Come on people get real!
Flying is the most environmentally destructive thing you can do--unless you own a forest which you can burn down.
The oddest bit of this testimony was the talk of fiscal measures and--wait for this--carbon capture and storage!
What in gods name does possible government responses to climate change have to do with this hugely polluting plan.
He could have just shouted--look over there nothing of interest going on here.
It was a joke.
But coal was only one of the issues voted on this past tuesday (Via Climate Change Corp):
Other positions on the ETS backed by lawmakers include full auctioning of allowances to the power sector from 2013 (though with some exceptions, for example for district heating), payment of half of auction revenues into an international climate protection fund, inclusion of shipping in cap-and-trade, and a higher exemption threshold for small-scale emitters (up from the Commission's proposed 10,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year to 25,000 tons).
While the ETS obliges industry to cut emissions, Finnish Green MEP Satu Hassi oversaw proposals requiring EU countries to reduce non-ETS emissions by 10 percent overall between 2013 and 2020.
This will contribute to a goal of a 20 percent cut by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, rising to 30 percent if an international climate deal is done.
Under Hassi's direction, the Environment Committee added new longer-term emissions reduction targets – 50 percent by 2035, and 60-80 percent by 2050.
Lord Turner of the Climate Change Committee has just written to Ed Milliband of the newly formed Department for Energy and Climate Change.
This letter--reccomending 80% cuts in emissions by 2050 along with inclusion of international aviation and shipping--has made waves in the news.
"The 80% target should apply to the sum of all sectors of the UK economy, including international aviation and shipping.
To the extent that international aviation and shipping emissions are not reduced by 80%, either these sectors would have to purchase credits, or more effort would have to be made in other sectors.
We therefore recommend that the emissions reduction target for those sectors covered by the Climate Change Bill should be at least 80%.
"
As part of the climate change bill the government set up and advisory committee, which Gordon Brown tasked with finding a suitable target.
Well, they have, and the target is 80% reduction by 2050 including aviation and shipping .
That sort of demand is 10 a penny from the likes of the sustainable development commission, environmental audit committee and various NGO's but this is coming from the very organisation setup to offer advice on the climate bill...it would be odd if the advice where ignored.
Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a technology that when developed would allow the climate changing emissions from large fossil fuel power plants to be prevented from entering the atmosphere and instead pumped underground into some kind of geological formation.
"It is confirmed - cabinet office minister Ed Miliband will be secretary of state at the new energy and climate change department.
"
The new department will take over the energy brief from the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and the climate change portfolio from the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.
Craig Bennett, director at the Prince of Wales' influential Corporate Leaders on Climate Change group, gave the reshuffle a cautious welcome, but warned there were many potential pitfalls that the new department could face.
"Having a dedicated department for climate change should help move it up the political agenda and having climate change championed in cabinet will be useful, " he said.
"But the devil will be in the detail... you could see it working very well, but you could also see it working very badly.
"
He warned that managing climate change through one department could allow other departments that have a direct impact on carbon emissions, such as transport and food, sideline the issue.
"There is also a risk that by putting energy and climate change together you could lose sight of the fact that climate change is not just about energy," he said.
"Issues such as adaptation and new technology could get lost if you look at climate change purely through an energy lens.
"
Friends of the Earth executive director Andy Atkins also gave the new department a ringing endorsement.
"The creation of a single department to overs ee climate and energy policy is a big step forward," he said.
"This is a golden opportunity to ensure the UK’s energy and climate policy – so often at loggerheads – work together to tackle both the climate and the energy crisis.
"
"By making the right sustainable energy choices, we can tackle energy security and climate change together, and we look forward to working with Ed Miliband to this make this happen.
"
On October 13th The Climate Rush is Going to Parliament
Shock-horror.
It seems that the big polluters actually suppressed evidence and denied the conclusions of their own scientific advisors!
Who'd have thought it.
Shocking and wholly unexpected.
I, for one, am shaken to the core that such paragons of civic and environmental virtue would stoop to such shit-splattering levels of sociopathic deceit.

Now for the serious bit: airport expansion is seriously bad for local people, increased noise, air pollution, and especially the climate.
The aviation industry want to expand airports across the UK and Europe, but opposition is huge, and the scientists are telling us we have to drastically cut emissions if we are to beat climate change.
Flashmobs are a fun way to highlight the real opposition there is to expansion at airports across Europe.
Here's another big chance to show our opposition to a 3rd runway at Heathrow.
Lib Dem MP David Howarth held a meeting in Westminster to present a highly disturbing and potentially explosive report on the way police in the UK are criminalising legitimate protest.
The report, produced by the Climate Camp's legal support team and entitled Policing of the Kingsnorth Climate Camp: Preventing Disorder or Preventing Protest?, is devastating for the police.
Ice and water continue to make the news
The Guardian has generally been very sympathetic to the Climate Camp.
The Guardian has always had a strong editorial line on climate change and many readers sypathise with our activities.
One of our main activities has been an ongoing campaign against eon .
As eon are planning the first new coal plant in 30 years at Kingsnorth in Kent I think that our motivation is quite transparent; allowing new coal development in the developed world is not only damaging on our own climate targets but also on our credibility and on the climate negotiations as a whole.
eon try to distract from this hugely distructive role that they are playing by--i kid you not--putting a few solar pannels on a coal plant!
The Guardian recently ripped this to shreads .
Given the sympathy towards us, and the antipathy towards our targets it is somewhat baffling to see that rather than inviting Climate Campers along to there climate change summit for our take on the challenge ahead, they invite eon to become a major sponsor !
Finally it may be worth noting that eon's head office has been visited and protested by: Climate Camp , People and Planet , Christian Aid ...and possibly a few others.
Civil society in the UK is united against this company but The Guardian feels able to sell them some much needed credibility.
It is right and proper that the events leading up to the death of Ian Tomlinson should be the subject of a criminal investigation but the danger, as we see it, is that it will be seen as an isolated incident and will be dealt with simply by disciplining individual officers, only serving to further obscure the role of the police in perpetuating a climate of fear.
Under the terms of the global surveillance state, citizenship has become an exercise in evading a charge of deviance.
In fact, the proliferation of forms of deviance is the flip side of the supposed 'lifestyle choices' available under the terms of consumer citizenship.
You can 'choose' to spend your money on home improvements, high fashion and high-tech gadgets and are applauded for making the 'right' choices.
But if you choose to occupy an unused building for the purposes of providing space for political discussion, self-education and creative activities without the intrusion of CCTV cameras, health and safety monitoring or access restrictions, and particularly if you refuse to levy a charge which situates these activities in terms of market forces, then you effectively become outlaw.. And, if you choose to express your outrage at a system that produces inequalities and then condemns those that become unemployed and homeless, you become a target for repression.
The differences between Tomlinson and the people who went to the Bank of England to demonstrate against the iniquitous excesses of neoliberal capitalism are marginal, despite attempts to distinguish between 'innocent' bystanders and 'guilty' protesters.
Tomlinson was on his way home from work.
The demonstrators were exercising their lawful right to protest.
Both were exercising their right to the city as citizens of a supposed democracy
Tonight members of the camp for climate action where on...
EON 's plans top build the first new coal plant in over 30 years continue to focus the minds of climate change activists throughout the country.
"114 activists were arrested in a 2am raid on a community centre in Sneinton Dale , Nottingham early on Easter Monday, 13th April 2009.
It is believed that a protest was planned at the Eon powerstation at Ratcliffe-on-Soar and Eon has released a statement confirming this.
The Ratcliffe-on-Soar coal-fired power station is the 3rd largest source of carbon dioxide emissions in the UK and has been previously targeted by activists.
Similar to past police actions, some of the homes of those arrested have been raided while they were held in custody.
It has been confirmed that 5 properties have already been raided in Nottingham and the SUMAC Centre and personal paperwork and computers have been seized.
Activists are now being released on bail, to appear in court on 14th July, with no other conditions.
More raids are expected.
This police action is reminiscent of the arrests of climate change activists in April 2007 when they were on their way to protest against the M1 widening.
While the protestors were held in custody their homes were raided and computers were taken.
A year after the arrests the M1 case was thrown out of court.

Gordon Brown and sheep-dog Boris both make extravagant claims about the greening of their budgets and the blissful cornucopia of fairy dust technology that will miraculously trump the ugly realities of a finite planet.
Should be worth a few votes.
It's a conundrum, isn't it?
Development and climate change.
Such a dilemma -convoluted and labyrinthine, loaded and provocative.
Whilst India pushes for escape from endemic poverty by pursuing a Nano for everyone, its' islands start to disappear, as do its' neighbours .
The result of success will be failure.
Hmm. Tricky.
Plenty of arguments to be had there.
Good job we're all totally focused on it and not distracted by beer and football.
A few interesting pieces of writing about the the way the police dealt with the climate camp:
The Joint Committee on Human Rights suggests that “the deployment of riot police can unnecessarily raise the temperature at protests”.
On Wednesday riot police were sent into peaceful crowds, hitting people with truncheons and riot shields.
Aggressive dogs were used to intimidate.
The report is concerned about the “improper use” of Section 76 of the Counter Terrorism Act 2008 to prevent photographing or filming police.
When the police broke up the climate camp, people were forced to delete images and film that showed the police in action.
The report states that “inconvenience or disruption alone are not sufficient reasons for preventing a protest from taking place”, and that the police need more human rights training.
Claiming that indiscriminate tactics, such as “kettles” to contain and break up protests, were employed in order to deal with “a small number of people” is an admission that the rights of others to protest can go to the wall.
Parliamentarians have yet to address the legality of the police database in which information on thousands of protestors is held.
On April 1 climate campers were unable to leave unless they gave names and addresses and had their photos taken.
The database has just got much bigger.
But the other, the Climate Camp on Bishopsgate, harboured no such elements, and continued peacefully all day.
Yet the 800 people at this street party were still attacked by riot police very suddenly in the evening.
Footage has been posted on the internet showing officers repeatedly hitting unarmed civilians
What is downright sinister, however, is that all those who were visiting the Climate Camp at that time were violently attacked and then trapped for many hours by the police.
They were not allowed to leave between 7pm and midnight, even if they had been injured.
Even a woman in a wheelchair was held.
Their claim is that they corral groups of protesters so that they can isolate the anti-social elements.
But by the time they mounted their attacks, the police had had nearly seven hours to assess whether any such element had ever been present.
The fact that the Climate Camp protesters mounted no violence in response to that meted out to them suggests that their intentions of mounting a peaceful protest had been successful.
Quote from David Howarth MP (LD) who attended Climate Camp in the City:
Climate Camp in the City was a huge success despite police violence against peaceful protestors bringing the event to a premature end.
Here is their photopool .
Here is a video from the spait of mass arrests.
Here is a video by visiononTV from a demo called 'system change not climate change'.
The latest round of UN climate talks are under way in Copenhagen.
Pressure for an agreement is growing as those living with climate impacts become ever more vocal and the risks of 'business as usual' greenhouse gas emissions become better understood.
Seventeen years of negotiations with rising global emissions is enough to convince some that 'business as usual' is now an accurate way of describing not only the worlds emissions trajectory but the climate talks as well.
The Copenhagen talks do have the possibility of proving the doubters wrong but there are a great many areas of contention still to be settled.
"[we] may be closer than some observers realise to agreeing the emissions cuts required to give the world a reasonable chance of avoiding global warming of more than two degrees"
If we achieved this much we would only have a 50% chance of achieving less than two degrees of climate change.
That's like playing Russian roulette with 3 bullets; reasonable?
So Stern's optimism assumes that: 1.
We take on the most ambitious targets on the table 2.
We are lucky and the atmosphere acts in a manner that is only 50% likely 3.
Stern has done his accounting better than McKinsey and finally 4.
All the loopholes in land use change and forestry are tied up rather than supported by Europe.
If Nicholas Stern gives us the good news, the bad news would have to be provided by the Ukraine(2) who won 1st prize for fossil of the day by the Climate Action Network.
First prize was awarded for their emissions reduction target of -20% on 1990 levels.
That is 75% higher than their emissions actually are.
This gap was created because the baseline projection of emissions didn't take into account the breakup of the Soviet union.
All of these emissions permits that haven't been used where then sold to Japan so it can now comply with Kyoto for 300M euros.
No real emissions where saved in this farce.
Climate Talks the New 'Business as Usual' ?
During the first couple of thousand days of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change there may have been a few dreamers.
But now, in 2009, 6000 days after the Rio Earth Summit where this whole process began, the UNFCCC has become positively hostile to hope.
You see, dreamers like to imagine a better world and a world of possibilities.
The UNFCCC was setup to achieve a dreamt of world where Business as Usuall emissions growth had been avoided, where nations had clubbed together and fought climate change, each according to his abilities and been supported, each according to his needs.
Unlike most dreams this was a vision unavoidably teathered to the real world through the basic laws of physics and through time.
What was Climate Camp 2008 and how did it work?
I`ve just got back from holiday.
I had a charming time in Kent at the Camp for Climate Action, me, some friends and about 1500 police officers from 27 different forces.
The climate camp has several strands to it:
Acting as a space to think, educate and develop the climate movement.
Acting as a place for non-violent direct action against the root causes of climate change.
The climate camp was special for so many other reasons but these three factors where the foundations upon which an extremely ambitious and high profile project was constructed.
For more about the climate camp check out the latest episode of Climate Radio by Phil England.

"On the 10th April 2007, 11 people walked into the Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station and locked on to the coal conveyor and assorted plant there.
Their objective was to take direct action to halt operations and thus to diminish the CO2 emissions of the E-on plant, the greenhouse gas thought to be largely responsible for climate change.
They were all charged with aggravated trespass and throughout the court case (which lasted for 3 days), the defendants argued that yes, they did take these actions, but employed the defence of "duress of circumstances" or necessity, and pleaded not guilty.
This trial was interesting due to the defence being used.
The accused stated that they where forced to take this course of action bearing in mind the threat posed by climate change if inaction where to be the chosen course of action.

Arguements on climate change, seem to have receeded from the mainstream.
However, some of the premises used have not been publically discredited.
For example the case for action was hindered by arguments based on certainty of the science, we have largely stopped having these arguments as the science is solid: we have a problem.
However, there are still error bars around various climate impacts, a good example being sea level rise.
So this sort of argument will raise it's ugly head again.
What is needed is a more clear eyed look at the decison being made.
Who has the right to decide weather a certain level of climate change is dangerous?
What is the moral case for developed nations cutting emissions slowly, while the risk is placed on the inhabitants of low island developing states?
Climate change arguments are widely distorted in the media, a whole range of arguments need to be grounded in a moral framework.
So many of the cliched arguments are based on premises which if applied to every day situations would bee seen as farsical.
The Rock Ethics Institute at Penn State University is looking at these issues in detail.

UNEP Adapting to Climate Change and Political Commitment: Video + Notes
For whatever reason - the wreckage of Hurricane Katrina, Al Gore's "An Inconvenient Truth," the plight of polar bears in the Arctic, the Democratic takeover of Congress - this is the moment when corporate America has at long last decided to get serious about global warming.
Joining hands with environmentalists, the CEOs of ten Fortune 500 companies, among them GE (Charts), Alcoa (Charts), DuPont, and utilities Duke Energy and PG&E (Charts), last month called on the government to regulate the greenhouse gases caused by burning fossil fuels.
Dozens of big companies, including Wal-Mart (Charts), have pledged to reduce their own emissions of carbon dioxide.
In a twist on the theme, Dell (Charts) will arrange to have trees planted for customers who pay $2 to offset the CO2 generated when a computer is plugged into the power grid.
"This is an $11 billion step in the wrong direction," fumes David Hawkins, a climate-change expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council.
"And when you're marching backward with $11 billion, you can do a lot of damage.
"
As for climate change, he allows that it's an "important and long-term issue" and says TXU's plants will be designed so that someday they can be retrofitted to capture and store carbon.
Right now, there's no way to capture carbon from coal-burning plants.
But, McCall says, "we have confidence that technology will come along.
"
TXU is fighting not just the usual activists from the Sierra Club and Public Citizen but environmental groups like Environmental Defense and the Natural Resources Defense Council, which are ordinarily business-friendly.
(With GE, DuPont, and others, they formed the coalition of big companies to lobby for carbon caps.
)
Albert J. Huddleston, a pro-business Republican who helped finance the Swift Boat television ads against John Kerry in 2004, is funding a lawsuit against TXU because he's concerned about mercury contamination of lakes and fish.
The need for urgent action on climate change is beginning to be reflected in the corporate world, albeit not in a uniform pattern.
In presenting a break-out session on climate change, Sue Hall posed the question of whether climate change can make markets restructure, particularly in light of the Stern Review Report which highlighted the fact that there may well be inadequate private capital to meet the costs of climate related catastrophes.
In the aftermath of Katrina, the US government need to appropriate $28 billion for flood risks.
Gary Guzy of Marsh, the insurance firm, remarked that insurers are withdrawing from property insurance in coastal areas.
Consequently, Florida's largest insurer is the State Fund.
Responsibility for mitigating climate change has been well received by companies such as Sun Micro and UTC.
John Mandyck of Carrier Corporation, a UTC company, cited that energy produces 85 per cent of all emissions and, in the US, the average home has increased in size by 60 per cent over the past fifteen years.
This is an important consideration as 30 per cent of energy usage in the US is due to air-conditioning.
Therefore, they are aiming to launch new goals to achieve a 20 per cent reduction in energy usage.
Dave Douglas at Sun estimated that IT "can wipe out all the climate gains made through having platinum star green buildings" as powering all the IT systems produces a billion tonnes of CO2 worldwide.
This has prompted Sun to develop Ecoservers which, if certain "market issues" were addressed, would provide a benefit to consumers in terms of offsetting the reduction of their footprint.
Truman Semans of the Pew Centre stated that in assessing corporate activity on climate change, many companies were not transparent on the returns their emissions reductions programmes have brought.
However, in asking companies to list the most effective strategies, energy conservation always comes out on top.
In terms of the highest impact on a company's NPV (net present value), these are usually perceived as regulatory.
Integrating climate into a broader sweep of business strategy therefore seems to make a valuable business case, especially if extended to value-chain partnerships and biofuels.
Yet, as Sun's Douglas stated, they are "being affected by regulatory uncertainty," especially when it comes to assessing environmental and climate regulations in deciding where is best to build as new factory.
In an unprecedented action, representatives for more than 10,000 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency scientists are calling on Congress to take immediate action against global warming, according to a petition released today by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER).
The petition also calls for an end to censorship of agency scientists and other specialists on topics of climate change and the effects of air pollution.
The petition stresses that time is running out to prevent cataclysmic environmental changes induced by human-caused pollution and urges Congress to undertake prompt actions:
“If we wait, we will be committing the next generation of Americans to approximately double the current global warming concentrations, with the associated adverse impacts on human health and the environment.”
The filing of this petition coincides with today’s oral arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court on a case (Massachusetts v. EPA, Case No.
05-1120) brought by states seeking to force the Bush administration to regulate greenhouse gases that fuel global warming under the Clean Air Act [see previous post].
“EPA’s scientists and engineers [must be able] to speak frankly and directly with Congress and the public regarding climate change, without fear of reprisal.”
“Professionals working for the Environmental Protection Agency are protesting being ordered to sit on the sidelines while we face the greatest environmental challenge of our generation,” stated PEER Executive Director Jeff Ruch, noting that the petition began among agency staff.
“Under a new Congress, perhaps the scientists at EPA can begin to directly communicate with their true employers – the American public.”
The recent RIBA conference sounds like a fairly dramatic affair.

Meanwhile, the Bush
The agreement between the prime minister and the governor follows a climate change meeting between the two men and leading businessmen in Long Beach yesterday as part of Mr Blair's tour of the US.
Much more...The statement endorsed by both Mr Blair and Mr Schwarzenegger binds the UK and California to "urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote low carbon technologies".
"California and the UK recognise the links between climate change, energy security, human health and robust economic growth," the statement said.
"Working together, California and the UK commit to build upon current efforts, share experiences, find new solutions and work to educate the public on the need for aggressive action to address climate change and promote energy diversity.
"
A spokesman for Mr Blair said that both parties would consider whether they could co-operate on an emissions trading scheme, such as that recently adopted by the EU.
He added that officials would even look at whether California could be included in the EU's own programme, under which companies trade the right to emit carbon dioxide using a permit system.
Commenting on the need to tackle global climate change, Mr Blair told business leaders, including BP chief Lord Browne and Virgin boss Richard Branson, that "the answers to this will come in the end by the development of the right science and technology".
Mr Schwarzenegger, whose strong environmental agenda as Californian governor contrasts with that of US president George Bush, who refuses to sign the international Kyoto protocol on global warming, criticised the lack of leadership shown by the White House in tackling climate change.
WASHINGTON -- Britain and California are preparing to sidestep the Bush administration and fight global warming together by creating a joint market for greenhouse gases.
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and California Gov.
Arnold Schwarzenegger plan to lay the groundwork for a new trans-Atlantic market in carbon dioxide emissions, The Associated Press has learned.
Such a move could help California cut carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases scientists blame for warming the planet.
President Bush has rejected the idea of ordering such cuts.
The aim is to fix a price on carbon pollution, an unwanted byproduct of burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gasoline.
The idea is to set overall caps for carbon and reward businesses that find a profitable way to minimize their carbon emissions, thereby encouraging new, greener technologies.
Monday's meeting was being hosted by Steve Howard, CEO of The Climate Group, and Lord John Browne, chairman of British Petroleum.
British and American business leaders planned to use it to also discuss other ways of accelerating use of low-carbon technologies.
In California, government officials disputed that the agreement was an attempt to sidestep the White House.
In a conference call with reporters, state Environmental Protection Agency Secretary Linda Adams said the agency is in "constant contact" with federal regulators, but added that there was no discussion with Washington about Monday's agreement, which involves only voluntary actions.
The world's only mandatory carbon trading program is in Europe.
Created in conjunction with the Kyoto Protocol, a 1997 international treaty that took effect last year, it caps the amount of carbon dioxide that can be emitted from power plants and factories in more than two dozen countries.
Companies can trade rights to pollute directly with each other or through exchanges located around Europe as long as the cap is met.
Canada, one of more than 160 nations that signed Kyoto, plans a similar program.
Although the United States is one of the few industrialized nations that haven't signed the treaty, some Eastern states are developing a regional cap-and-trade program.
And some U.S. companies have voluntarily agreed to cap their carbon pollution as part of a new Chicago-based market.
Blair has called on Britain to reduce carbon emissions to 60 percent of its 1990 levels by 2050.
Britain also has been looking at imposing individual limits on carbon pollution.
People who accumulate unused carbon allowances - for example, by driving less, or switching to less-polluting vehicles - could sell them to people who exceed their allowances - for example by driving more.
Bush has resisted Blair's efforts to make carbon reduction a top international priority.
After taking office, Bush reversed a 2000 campaign pledge to regulate carbon dioxide emissions, then withdrew U.S. support from the Kyoto treaty requiring industrialized nations to cut their greenhouse gases to below 1990 levels.
The United States is responsible for a quarter of the world's global warming pollution.
Bush administration officials argue that requiring cuts in greenhouse gases would cost the U.S. economy 5 million jobs.
Instead, the administration has poured billions of dollars into research aimed at slowing the growth of most greenhouse gases while advocating a global cut on one of them, methane.
Craig Noble of the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, said the pact had symbolic value but "the time for talk is over.
" He urged passage of a proposal, pending in the state legislature, that would make California the first state in the nation to cap greenhouse gas emissions from industrial sources.
The event was organized by Climate Group, a nonprofit organization based in London.
Most of the companies being represented, including BP and DuPont, have announced climate-change initiatives that include a commitment to reduce carbon emissions believed to cause global warming.
"This meeting just shows that climate change has moved to the top of the corporate agenda and the political agenda," said Steve Howard, CEO of Climate Group.
Critics say Mr. Connaughton's absence follows an "obstructionist stance" by the White House on efforts to rein in emissions that many scientists say lead to global warming.
The Bush administration pulled out of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, an agreement signed by Britain and most other developed countries to cut greenhouse-gas emissions 5% below 1990 levels by 2012.
Administration officials and their supporters have argued that the Kyoto accord would have hurt the U.S. economically, in part because developing countries weren't part of the agreement, so would have enjoyed a cost advantage.
Some policy analysts also question how dire global warming is, as well as the role of humans in causing it.
President Bush has instead pushed a strategy of seeking voluntary cutbacks, more research on climate and a push for new energy sources, such as hydrogen.
For Mr. Blair, climate change has been a top priority.
When Mr. Blair was chairman of the Group of Eight summit in Gleneagles, Scotland, last year, for example, he put the issue at the top of the agenda.
In the most comprehensive survey ever undertaken of the massive ice sheets covering both Greenland and Antarctica, NASA scientists confirm climate warming is changing how much water remains locked in Earth's largest storehouses of ice and snow.
"If the trends we're seeing continue and climate warming continues as predicted, the polar ice sheets could change dramatically," said survey lead author Jay Zwally of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md.
"The Greenland ice sheet could be facing an irreversible decline by the end of the century.
"
Other recent studies have shown increasing losses of ice in parts of these sheets.
This new survey is the first to inventory the losses of ice and the addition of new snow on both in a consistent and comprehensive way throughout an entire decade.
The survey shows there was a net loss of ice from the combined polar ice sheets between 1992 and 2002 and a corresponding rise in sea level.
The survey documented for the first time extensive thinning of the West Antarctic ice shelves, an increase in snowfall in the interior of Greenland and thinning at the edges.
All are signs of a warming climate predicted by computer models.
The survey combines new satellite mapping of the height of the ice sheets from two European Space Agency satellites.
It also used previous NASA airborne mapping of the edges of the Greenland ice sheets to determine how fast the thickness is changing.
Researchers used nine years of elevation mapping over much of Antarctica and 10.5 years of data over Greenland from the European Remote-sensing Satellites 1 and 2.
The survey pinpointed where the ice sheets were thinning and where they were growing.
In Greenland, the survey saw large ice losses along the southeastern coast and a large increase in ice thickness at higher elevations in the interior due to relatively high rates of snowfall.
This study suggests there was a slight gain in the total mass of frozen water in the ice sheet over the decade studied, contrary to previous assessments.
According to Zwally, this situation may have changed in just the past few years.
Last month NASA scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., reported a speed up of ice flow into the sea from several Greenland glaciers.
That study included observations through 2005; Zwally's survey concluded with 2002 data.
"The melting of ice at the edges of the ice sheet is also increasing, which causes the ice to flow faster," Zwally said.
"A race is going on in Greenland between these competing forces of snow build-up in the interior and ice loss on the edges.
But we don't know how long they will be approximately in balance with each other or if that balance has already tipped in favor of the recently accelerating outflow from glaciers.
"
The situation was very different in Antarctica.
The ice sheets had a major net loss of ice due to outflow from West Antarctica.
These losses, which may have been going on for decades, outweighed the gains in snow and ice seen in the East Antarctic ice sheet and parts of West Antarctica.
Also thinning were the ice shelves around West Antarctica, where temperatures have been increasing.
The floating ice shelves are vulnerable to climate change.
Some ice shelves in the Antarctic Peninsula have totally disintegrated in recent years, allowing the ice from the land to move into the ocean faster.
When the scientists added up the gains and losses of ice from the Greenland and Antarctic sheets, there was a net loss of ice to the sea.
The Greenland ice sheet annually gained approximately 11 billion tons of water, while Antarctica lost about 31 billion tons per year.
The 20 billion net tons added to the oceans is equivalent to the amount of fresh water annually used in homes, businesses and farming in New York, New Jersey and Virginia.
"The study indicates that the contribution of the ice sheets to sea-level rise during the decade studied was much smaller than expected, just two percent of the recent increase of nearly three millimeters (0.12 inches) a year," Zwally said.
"Current estimates of the other major sources of sea-level rise - expansion of the ocean by warming temperatures and runoff from low-latitude glaciers - do not make up the difference, so we have a mystery on our hands as to where the water is coming from.
Continuing research using NASA satellites and other data will narrow the uncertainties in this important issue and help solve the mystery.

Former US Vice President Al Gore has expressed his belief that tackling climate change presents the global community with an opportunity to unite around a shared moral purpose.
Mr Gore was addressing an audience of business leaders and opinion formers brought together by The Climate Group on the climate change crisis facing the planet.
At the start of his presentation, Mr Gore explained that in Chinese, the word crisis is represented by 2 characters, one meaning danger, one meaning opportunity.
His dramatic multi-media presentation addressed both these in the context of global warming.
Images and animation of the earth from space, of glacial retreat and shattering ice, of projected sea level rise and the shut down of the gulf stream were beamed onto the vast screen of London’s Imax cinema as the former Vice President explained the indisputable correlation between C02 and rising temperatures.
But Mr Gore did not dwell simply on the impacts.
He was clear that, as well as the economic opportunities associated with moving to a low carbon economy, action on this issue would present a much greater opportunity still – the chance to find a shared moral purpose.
According to Mr Gore, “this is a rare opportunity that few generations experience.
As we rise to the challenge of climate change the moral clarity and vision we develop will enable us to identify other problems masquerading as political problems that are in fact moral imperatives.
The opportunity is there for us to transform the way we go about our lives.”
Mr Gore’s presentation was given to a select audience of opinion formers, business leaders and company representatives gathered together by The Climate Group.
However, his message, and his mesmerising presentation, will soon be accessible on a much broader scale with the forthcoming release of the movie, An Inconvenient Truth.
The bill requires that emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases linked to global warming be reduced by 145 million tons, or 25 percent less than the current forecast, by 2020.
That would bring the emissions back to the 1990 level.
The gases in question are produced when fossil fuels are burned, whether in motor vehicles, power plants or other industrial facilities.
Many scientists have linked the growing concentration of these gases in the atmosphere to an observed increase in surface temperatures.
The legislation could have more than a statewide impact, because California has traditionally led the nation in pollution-control efforts.
Standards and rules established by the air control board have often been emulated by other states.
"The speaker said this bill was his top legislative priority this year," said Craig Noble, a spokesman for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group that is supporting the bill.
"The governor has said he wants to reduce emissions.
That means we have a very good chance of getting a first law in the nation to set statewide limits on emissions.
"
The ASEAN nations have just (15 Jan, 2007) signed the Cebu Declaration on East Asian Energy Security.
Much like progress throughout the rest of the world, this can be seen as progress and commitment to improving energy infrastructure but not as a serious assault on the worlds ever escalating emissions.
Patterns of growth in energy consumption and deforestation are so extreme that an ad hoc assemblage of --even well thought out--policies and measures are never going to lead to the dramatic reductions in emissions required, only a mitigation of accelerating trends.
I don't think that the world can seriously be considered to be fighting climate change at the current time.
Without a global framework--most plausibly Contraction and Convergence--and tough targets that are based on the science, policies will continue to be commensurate with what is comfortable and advantageous for competition, not what is required.
This, like so many other international agreements, can therefore only be viewed as progress in the sense that those involved are building capacity and gaining experience.
Given the tremendously time constrained nature of the climate challenge this incremental ism is not an encouraging behaviour to be coming from our national leaders.
We need radical change, we need to learn as we act, putting a toe in the water is often fine, in our situation however, the spectre of a rapidly destabilising climate is advancing on us at such speed that we better swim soon if we are to save a significant proportion of our biodiversity, our political systems and of course our economies.
RECOGNISING the limited global reserve of fossil energy, the unstable world prices of fuel oil, the worsening problems of environment and health, and the urgent need to address global warming and climate change;
Mitigate greenhouse gas emission through effective policies and measures, thus contributing to global climate change abatement; and
Pursue and encourage investment on energy resource and infrastructure development through greater private sector involvement.
Encourage collective efforts in intensifying the search for new and renewable energy resources and technologies, including research and development in biofuels;
Promote clean use of coal and development of clean coal technologies and international environmental cooperation towards mitigating global climate change;
South-east Asia's palm oil industry will be celebrating.
They've just drawn up plans for Indonesia's single biggest biodiesel/palm oil project as yet.
Sinar Mas may just have got closer to realising its dream of destroying the 'Heart of Borneo' and getting the megaplantation which NGOs wrongly thought they'd stopped last year.
Sustainable palm oil?
The likes of Sinar Mas certainly don't waste their time with the Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil - they don't need to.
With most of the new plantations now planned in the peatlands, that's probably some 50 billion tonnes of carbon up in smoke (or rather committed to going into the atmosphere).
Some concrete results for the climate indeed!

European Commission has carried out a study into the impacts of climate change on Europe.
When considering the quote bellow, please remember that Europe is far more able to adapt to climate change then many contries of the south, and is also less vulnerable for geographic and business reasons.
A new report from FAO says livestock production contributes to the world's most pressing environmental problems, including global warming, land degradation, air and water pollution, and loss of biodiversity.
Using a methodology that considers the entire commodity chain, it estimates that livestock are responsible for 18 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, a bigger share than that of transport.
However, the report says, the livestock sector's potential contribution to solving environmental problems is equally large, and major improvements could be achieved at reasonable cost.
Based on the most recent data available, Livestock's long shadow takes into account the livestock sector's direct impacts, plus the environmental effects of related land use changes and production of the feed crops animals consume.
It finds that expanding population and incomes worldwide, along with changing food preferences, are stimulating a rapid increase in demand for meat, milk and eggs, while globalization is boosting trade in both inputs and outputs.
Despite its wide-ranging environmental impacts, livestock is not a major force in the global economy, generating just under 1.5 percent of total GDP.
But the livestock sector is socially and politically very significant in developing countries: it provides food and income for one billion of the world's poor, especially in dry areas, where livestock are often the only source of livelihoods.
"Since livestock production is an expression of the poverty of people who have no other options," FAO says, "the huge number of people involved in livestock for lack of alternatives, particularly in Africa and Asia, is a major consideration for policy makers.
"
In the process, the livestock sector is undergoing a complex process of technical and geographical change.
Production is shifting from the countryside to urban and peri-urban areas, and towards sources of animal feed, whether feed crop areas or transport and trade hubs where feed is distributed.
There is also a shift in species, with accelerating growth in production of pigs and poultry (mostly in industrial units) and a slow-down in that of cattle, sheep and goats, which are often raised extensively.
Today, an estimated 80 percent of growth in the livestock sector comes from industrial production systems.
Owing to those shifts, the report says, livestock are entering into direct competition for scarce land, water and other natural resources.
Deforestation, greenhouse gases.
The livestock sector is by far the single largest anthropogenic user of land.
Grazing occupies 26 percent of the Earth's terrestrial surface, while feed crop production requires about a third of all arable land.
Expansion of grazing land for livestock is a key factor in deforestation, especially in Latin America: some 70 percent of previously forested land in the Amazon is used as pasture, and feed crops cover a large part of the reminder.
About 70 percent of all grazing land in dry areas is considered degraded, mostly because of overgrazing, compaction and erosion attributable to livestock activity.
At the same time, the livestock sector has assumed an often unrecognized role in global warming.
Using a methodology that considered the entire commodity chain (see box below), FAO estimated that livestock are responsible for 18 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, a bigger share than that of transport.
It accounts for nine percent of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions, most of it due to expansion of pastures and arable land for feed crops.
It generates even bigger shares of emissions of other gases with greater potential to warm the atmosphere: as much as 37 percent of anthropogenic methane, mostly from enteric fermentation by ruminants, and 65 percent of anthropogenic nitrous oxide, mostly from manure.
Scientists usually tie their estimates of the greenhouse gas emissions responsible for global warming to sources such as land use changes, agriculture (including livestock) and transportation.
The authors of Livestock’s long shadow took a different approach, aggregating emissions throughout the livestock commodity chain - from feed production (which includes chemical fertilizer production, deforestation for pasture and feed crops, and pasture degradation), through animal production (including enteric fermentation and nitrous oxide emissions from manure) to the carbon dioxide emitted during processing and transportation of animal products.
Livestock production also impacts heavily the world's water supply, accounting for more than 8 percent of global human water use, mainly for the irrigation of feed crops.
Evidence suggests it is the largest sectoral source of water pollutants, principally animal wastes, antibiotics, hormones, chemicals from tanneries, fertilizers and pesticides used for feed crops, and sediments from eroded pastures.
While global figures are unavailable, it is estimated that in the USA livestock and feed crop agriculture are responsible for 37 percent of pesticide use, 50 percent of antibiotic use, and a third of the nitrogen and phosphorus loads in freshwater resources.
The sector also generates almost two-thirds of anthropogenic ammonia, which contributes significantly to acid rain and acidification of ecosystems.
The sheer quantity of animals being raised for human consumption also poses a threat of the Earth's biodiversity.
Livestock account for about 20 percent of the total terrestrial animal biomass, and the land area they now occupy was once habitat for wildlife.
In 306 of the 825 terrestrial eco-regions identified by the Worldwide Fund for Nature, livestock are identified as "a current threat", while 23 of Conservation International's 35 "global hotspots for biodiversity" - characterized by serious levels of habitat loss - are affected by livestock production.
Two demands.
FAO says "the future of the livestock-environment interface will be shaped by how we resolve the balance of two demands: for animal food products on one side and for environmental services on the other".
Since the natural resource base is finite, the huge expansion of the livestock sector required to meet expanding demand must be accomplished while substantially reducing its environmental impact.
Land degradation: Restore damaged land through soil conservation, silvopastoralism, better management of grazing systems and protection of sensitive areas.
Greenhouse gas emissions: Sustainable intensification of livestock and feed crop production to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from deforestation and pasture degradation, improved animal nutrition and manure management to cut methane and nitrogen emissions.
Water pollution: Better management of animal waste in industrial production units, better diets to improve nutrient absorption, improved manure management and better use of processed manure on croplands.
Biodiversity loss: As well as implementing the measures above, improve protection of wild areas, maintain connectivity among protected areas, and integrate livestock production and producers into landscape management.
Removal of price distortions at input and product level will enhance natural resource use, but may often not be sufficient.
Livestock's long shadow says environmental externalities, both negative and positive, need to be explicitly factored into the policy framework.
Livestock holders who provide environmental services need to be compensated, either by the immediate beneficiary (such as downstream users enjoying improved water quantity and quality) or by the general public.
Services that could be rewarded include land management or land uses that restore biodiversity, and pasture management that provides for carbon sequestration.
Compensation schemes also need to be developed between water and electricity providers and graziers who adopt grasslands management strategies that reduce sedimentation of water reservoirs.
Likewise, livestock holders who emit waste into waterways or release ammonia into the atmosphere should pay for the damage.
Applying the "polluter pays" principle should not present insurmountable problems for offenders, given the burgeoning demand for livestock products.
Information, communication and education will play critical roles in enhancing a "willingness to act".
With their strong and growing influence, consumers are likely to be the main source of commercial and political pressure "to push the livestock sector into more sustainable forms", Livestock's long shadow says.
Already, growing awareness of threats to the environment is translating into rising demand for environmental services: "This demand will broaden from immediate concerns - such as reducing the nuisance of flies and odours - to intermediate demands for clean air and water, then to the broader, longer-term environmental concerns, including climate change and loss of biodiversity".
Intensive animal production systems produce high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus wastes and concentrated discharges of toxic materials.
Yet those systems are often located in areas where effective waste management is more difficult.
The regional distribution of intensive systems is usually determined not by environmental concerns but by ease of access to input and product markets, and relative costs of land and labour.
In developing countries, industrial units are often concentrated in peri-urban environments because of infrastructure constraints.

23 February ‘Balancing Water Resources and the Principles of Sustainable Development’
Trevor Bishop is Head of Water Resource Management for the Environment Agency.
Trevor's national responsibilities include Strategic Water Resource Planning, Demand Management, Hydrology, Hydrogeology and Hydrometry.
Trevor has also recently taken up the role within the Agency as Project Executive for River Basin District Plans under the Water Framework Directive.
Prior to his current role Trevor was Head of Regulation and Asset Performance at Mid Kent Water having previously worked for Southern Water Services.
Before joining the Water Industry Trevor worked as an environmental consultant and a geologist in the oil industry.
A new National Water Resource Strategy is currently under development by the Environment Agency for publication in 2008.
The strategy will set the agenda for water resources across England and Wales with a planning horizon out to 2050.
This lecture will explore the state of our resources, the challenges anticipated over the planning period and the strategic principles which will need to underpin such a long term strategy.
Progress to date has started to polarise some of the key challenges faced by the proper use of water resources under an overarching agenda of sustainable development.
The demand for water is set to grow, both as a function of demographics but more significantly due to rising per capita consumption.
Not only is our use of water one of the highest in Europe but whilst per capita consumption across Europe is set to reduce still further, ours is forecast to continue its upwards rise.
Other key challenges include defining future levels of abstraction, consistent with the principles of sustainable development against a backdrop of new environmental imperatives and climate change.
Wider issues to also be covered will include the future role of the water sector within the carbon agenda and the mix of demand management and new resources to meet future challenges.
Professor Mark Kibblewhite is Head of the Department of Natural Resources at Cranfield University.
He is an environmental scientist with a leading role in European land-based natural resources policy.
His particular interest is in soil systems and he is the current chairman of the European Soil Bureau Network, as well as coordinator of a pan-European project (ENVASSO) providing technical support to the European Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection and the planned Soil Framework Directive.
He joined Cranfield in 2002 from the Environment Agency where he was Head of Land Quality and he previously worked for Hyder Consulting, DTI, ADAS and Severn-Trent.
He has an academic background in business economics and marketing, as well as soil science and environmental chemistry.
Soil is a form of natural capital.
It is a living system of great complexity that delivers hugely valuable ecosystem services in both rural and urban environments.
The management of soil has profound consequences for future economic and social outcomes.
This lecture will describe the soil system and some new scientific insights in to the evolution and functionality of the soil habitat.
It will summarise the main threats to soil and critique the strongly emergent soil protection policy agenda within the European Union and the UK.
A framework for future soil protection strategy will be explored, focusing on soil within existing and new urban development.
This will include options for improving awareness of soil among urban citizens and decision-makers, and the use of new technology for collecting data and reporting information on the spatial extent of soil-based natural capital and the impacts on this from different land allocation and management scenarios.
Questions that the lecture aims to answer are “What controls should be placed on future development to protect soil-based natural capital?
How can soil within the urban zone be managed best to protect and enhance natural capital?
How can the slow pace of soil development be accommodated within a rapidly growing urban economy?
How can soils help us to adapt to climate change?”
In that time he has contributed to the development and implementation of the Mayor’s Municipal Waste Management Strategy.
He is Principal Policy Officer within the Waste Strategy team and is currently working on the case for a single waste authority for London and local authority performance.
Peter also helped develop London waste database website www.capitalwastefacts.com in partnership with London Remade.
Before joining the GLA, Pete worked for Somerset County Council.
He worked on the Somerset Waste Strategy and contract management.
Wayne has ten years experience in the waste industry at all levels of local government.
He is the Principal Policy Officer at the Greater London Authority with responsibilities for implementing the Mayor’s Waste Municipal Waste Management Strategy.
He is currently involved in preparations for the Examination in Public of the Mayor’s Draft Alterations to the London Plan’s waste policies, and is working with stakeholders to develop new waste infrastructure in London.
He is the Secretary of the London Regional Technical Advisory Body (RTAB), and a member of Defra’s Technology Advisory Committee.
It will look at some of the challenges facing delivering sustainable waste management in a city-conurbation.
London currently relies heavily on landfill in the surrounding Counties.
The EU Landfill Directive and the need to manage waste sustainably mean that a step change is needed in how and where London deals with its waste.
London's existing waste management arrangements are complex and fragmented adding to the delivery challenge.
The speakers will address the policy response to these challenges which is set out in the Mayor's Municipal Waste Management Strategy and his spatial planning strategy the London Plan.
The lecture will specifically address the Mayor's preference for increasing recycling and delivering new technologies to manage London's waste as well as the recent review of London's waste governance arrangements and the likely impacts of that review.
He specialises in interdisciplinary research on the governance of marine protected areas and related marine resource management issues, drawing on and contributing to common-pool resource and marine policy literatures.
He is also a member of Natural England's Marine Science Technical Advisory Group.
It will begin with an outline of the differences between terrestrial and marine ecosystems that influence the appropriateness of management approaches.
Recent trends in marine exploitation and the background to the proposed Marine Bill will be discussed.
Key issues that will need to be addressed by the Bill will be considered, focusing on the ecosystem approach, the role of the precautionary principle, the role of stakeholders, how marine spatial planning might work and the need for a network of highly protected marine reserves.
The prospects for the Bill will be discussed, recognising that the Bill will need to balance the need to restore marine ecosystems with the need to provide for marine development activities such as fishing, renewable energy generation, aggregate extraction, carbon-dioxide sequestration, and oil/gas extraction.
It must also be remembered that increasing certainty for developers and streamlining the development consents process are key objectives of the Bill - it is not just about improving marine ecosystem conservation measures.
Finally, the need to address some emerging threats will be outlined, focusing on global warming and the related threat of ocean acidification.
In the most systematic analysis to date of recent changes in forest fire activity, Anthony Westerling, Hugo Hidalgo and Dan Cayan of Scripps Oceanography, along with Tom Swetnam of the University of Arizona, compiled a database of recent large western wildfires since 1970 and compared it with climate and land-surface data from the region.
The results show that large wildfire activity increased "suddenly and dramatically" in the 1980s with longer wildfire seasons and an increased number and more potent wildfires.
The scientists compiled a comprehensive time series of 1,166 forest wildfires of at least 1,000 acres that had occurred between 1970 and 2003 from wildfire data covering western U.S. Forest Service and National Park Service lands.
To investigate what role climate might play, the researchers compared the time series, the timing of snowmelt and spring and summer temperatures for the same 34 years.
For the timing of peak snowmelt in the mountains for each year, they used the streamflow gauge records from 240 stations throughout western North America.
The team also used other climatic data such as moisture deficit, an indicator of dryness.
The greatest wildfire increases occurred in the Northern Rockies, where forest ecosystems in middle elevations were found to be highly susceptible to temperature increases.
Other significant wildfire increases were found in the Sierra Nevada, the southern Cascades and the Coast Ranges of northern California and southern Oregon.
"I see this as one of the first big indicators of climate change impacts in the continental United States," said research team member Thomas Swetnam, director of the Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research at The University of Arizona in Tucson.
"We're showing warming and earlier springs tying in with large forest fire frequencies.
Lots of people think climate change and the ecological responses are 50 to 100 years away.
But it's not 50 to 100 years away—it's happening now in forest ecosystems through fire.
"
The authors state that climate model projections, driven by potential increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, indicate that warmer springs and summers will likely continue and intensify in the coming decades, accentuating conditions favorable to large wildfires.
Westerling says that the paper's results indicate that measures to limit future climate change could help to curtail catastrophic increases in future summer wildfires.
If climate warms markedly over today's levels, intensified fuels management and fire suppression are not likely to be effective in much of the western U.S., he said.
"The overall importance of climate in wildfire activity underscores the urgency of ecological restoration and fuels management to reduce wildfire hazards to human communities and to mitigate ecological impacts of climate change, especially in forests that have undergone substantial alterations due to past land uses," the authors note in the paper.
The authors conclude that the increased frequency of large and devastating wildfires may significantly change forest composition and reduce tree densities, transforming the western U.S. forests' role as a storage "sink" for sequestering some 20 to 40 percent of all U.S. carbon to a source for increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
The research was supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Office of Global Programs, the National Fire Plan via the United States Forest Service's Southern Research Station and the California Energy Commission.
If environmental, social, and human-health costs were reflected in the economics of electricity generation, wind energy would become even less costly compared to energy derived from fossil fuels.
Unlike conventional power plants, wind electrical generation does not release greenhouse gases that warm the climate or other polluting emissions.
There are no tall trees on Tilbury Marshes to the east of London.
The sea salt in the soil prevents them from growing.
But here, on the edge of the capital more than anywhere else, you get a real feel for the peculiar beauty of the Thames's great flood plain.
The area is prone to flooding, yet desperately short of drinking water; it is close to London, yet a million miles away in culture from the metropolis; it contains great swaths of brownfield sites, yet has some of the finest wetlands in Britain.
Now a "national priority for urban regeneration", and the "greatest piece of town planning Britain has ever seen", about 1.6 million people live there today, but perhaps twice that many will in just 15 years' time.
Few people, moreover, have any idea about what is going on.
A study last year by the Institute for Public Policy Research found that "very few participants had heard of the Thames Gateway".
In the past six months, the project's profile has grown for all the wrong reasons.
In October, the London assembly declared the capital was at "serious risk" of flooding, and that this would increase as a result of the Gateway homes being built on the flood plain.
Then the pressure group Transport 2000 found that £432m-worth of roads were to be built in the area.
If the proposed £450m Thames Gateway bridge, now the subject of a long public inquiry, is included, then perhaps £1bn is planned to build roads in the areas - despite the government's commitment to reducing traffic and climate change emissions.
To add to Prescott's woes, the Commons environmental audit committee last week lambasted the plans for sustainable housing.
Talking about plans for the south-east as a whole, but clearly including the Gateway, the MPs accused Prescott's Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) of "a complete lack of urgency in considering the environmental impact" and predicted that people would be moving into the area without schools, hospitals or transport.
"The need to build homes is seen as an absolute imperative and is used by government to sweep aside .
. .
concerns about the environmental impact," said the report.
Environment groups say the Gateway has the potential for huge harm, because it is situated on the flood plain, has little access to fresh water, and because the ODPM has missed the chance to demand sustainable housing.
The Environment Agency has stated £80bn of property could be damaged by floods in the Gateway and that massive investment is needed.
However, Chris Burnham, a policy adviser at the agency, says: "Flood risk is being addressed.
Local authorities must ensure that vulnerable developments are not placed in higher risk areas.
"
Meanwhile, fresh water supplies are a problem, too.
Plans for a desalination facility in Beckton were rejected by London's mayor, Ken Livingstone, last year.
Thames Water has already exploded plans to build 30,000 homes in Harlow, further north, by explaining that there simply wasn't sufficient capacity to support them.
As a party political issue, the environment has been a slow grower.
The fact that two prime ministers-in-waiting are currently raising the political heat over global warming shows how far the topic has travelled up the agenda.
Indeed, the battle for the green vote between the new adversaries intensifies today, with David Cameron revealing he would replace the controversial climate-change levy, the government's prized pollution tax on business, with a new "carbon levy".
His words follow a keynote address from Gordon Brown at the UN in New York, in which he defended the climate-change levy, saying it was "central" to the government's approach to cutting CO2 emissions.
Over the next five years, it would lower such pollution by six million tonnes, one third of Britain's total carbon reductions by 2010.
A poll earlier this year confirmed voters were increasingly prepared to make sacrifices to sustain the environment.
Around 63% of respondents approved of a green tax to discourage behaviour harmful to the environment.
For the most part, Mr Cameron has avoided detailed policies, saying they are still under review.
But he has argued that without economic "green growth", the measures to tackle climate change cannot be afforded.
Yesterday, as Mr Cameron gazed at melting icebergs off Norway, the chancellor was in New York telling world leaders climate change needed a global solution.
Over the next 48 hours, he will explain how Britain will invest in a new institute for research into alternative sources of energy and will call for an £11bn facility to diversify developing countries' energy supply.
In 2004, Professor Sir David King, the government's chief scientist, said the threat to the planet of global warming was worse than from terrorism.
Last week, he warned the Earth's temperature was likely to rise by at least 3C, putting 400 million people at risk of hunger and leaving up to three billion without adequate water supplies.
But while the environment will be the stuff of domestic politics in elections to come, expert and non-expert alike realise only by concerted worldwide action can the planet's climate be saved.
America, the world's largest polluter, is relying heavily on new technology to produce the solution; neither George W Bush nor the US Congress is willing to jeopardise Americans' standard of living.
As it develops at breakneck speed, the new kid on the economic block, China, is setting tough targets on limiting energy consumption and reducing pollution.
But it has missed them year on year.
"It still produces too much carbon, but it's a move in the right direction," the Conservative leader said today.
"To help tackle climate change, we must be for greener cars, not anti-car.
Today, many families want to become greener, and they're looking for more options to go green.
We should help them.
"
Transport accounts for just over one-quarter of the UK's carbon emissions, a figure that is forecast to rise by one-third over the next generation unless cars become less polluting.
Hybrid cars reduce carbon emissions by switching from petrol to electric power when it is more efficient.
Only a few small cars currently emit less than 100g a kilometre, but Tory strategists said technological innovation made the party's goal "challenging but efficient".
Mr Cameron said a Conservative government would offer "significant incentives" to buyers of low-emission cars and manufacturers researching hybrids, biofuels and new generation diesel.
"I want Britain to be at the forefront of international efforts to build a new generation of motor vehicles that are much less environmentally damaging," he said.
Hybrid cars are already exempt from the London congestion charge.
Discounted road tax and parking or exemptions from tolls and other road charges could be used to persuade motorists to switch.
But Mr Cameron did not say whether he would increase excise duty for polluting vehicles and added that a road-building programme was still necessary because "some extra road capacity" was needed.
However, Mr Reddy said Greenpeace wanted to see mandatory targets for manufacturers rather than merely incentives to produce greener cars.
The Conservatives should also tax airline fuel and passengers to reduce emissions from aviation, he said.
Mr Cameron has refused to say whether he supports a "green" tax on aviation.

LONDON - In a bid to boost his "green" credentials, Conservative leader David Cameron pledged on Friday to scrap the tax on British industry's use of energy and replace it with a more efficient system.
Cameron, who has made the environment a priority since he took over last December, said he would drop the Climate Change Levy in favour of a tariff which focuses on carbon emissions rather than energy use.
The 39-year-old was speaking in Norway, where he has travelled to witness first-hand the effects of global warming.
Critics have called the trip a stunt and nothing more than an expensive photo opportunity.
"Tackling climate change is a key part of my ambition for the Conservative Party to lead a new green revolution," Cameron said.
"I want to recapture climate change from the pessimists.
Of course it presents huge challenges.
Of course the issues are complex.
Of course it will require us to change.
"But when I think about climate change and our response to it, I don't think of doom and gloom, costs and sacrifice.
I think of a cleaner, greener world for our children to enjoy and inherit.
"
The Conservative party has always objected to the Climate Change Levy since it was introduced in 2001, prompting the Labour party to say their opponents were not ready to make the difficult decisions about how to safeguard the environment.
There is a review of recent tory posturing on climate change here .
This is quite interesting for us in the UK.
Our govornment have performed fairly miserably in terms of serious climate policies at the domestic level, despite strong words internationally.
The conservatives, traditionally the right wing, free market foes of environmentalists have picked up on climate change in a big way, progress looks like the only way now.
Lets hope something comes of this bipartisan agreement on the necessity of action.
In a key note speech on global warming, made during a visit to Norway, the Conservative leader also spelled out his plans for an alternative to the climate change levy.
He called for both local initiatives and action on a global scale in order to prevent climate change having a major impact on the planet.
"Tackling climate change will require genuinely fresh thinking," Cameron argued.
"The climate change levy is a tax on energy consumed by business,"
"The climate change levy should therefore be replaced by a carbon levy which better distinguishes between high and low carbon production of energy, and which retains fiscal neutrality.
"In particular, I have asked the group to consider whether the carbon levy should operate as a business tax (like the climate change levy) or as a market mechanism, in which low carbon energy production and business use is encouraged through tradeable credits.
"

BEIJING, March 29 -- China proposes to reduce emissions by millions of tons over the next 20 years in an effort to help reduce global warming through energy-saving technologies.
"If all of the national energy-saving standards have been fully implemented by 2020, China will be greatly contributing towards curbing global warming," said Wang.
At yesterday's opening ceremony of an international exhibition and forum on green and smart buildings in Beijing, Wang did not link the proposed emission cuts to the international cleaner development mechanism (CDM) projects currently under the framework of the UN's Kyoto Protocol.
To make the buildings more energy efficient, Qiu said environmental impact evaluations would be carried out during construction and when choosing what materials and machinery to install.
The use of PV systems in the public sector was also surveyed through questionnaires sent to municipal governments.
Of 242 respondents, 55.6 percent answered that they had "already installed one or more PV systems," while 23.2 percent replied that they "are considering the introduction of new or additional PV systems.
" When asked about the purpose of new/additional installation (multiple choices allowed), by far the largest number of respondents (91.4 percent) cited "environmental education and awareness promotion," followed by "reduction in carbon dioxide emissions" (74.1 percent) and "energy savings" (63.8 percent).
The intended installation sites were "school buildings" (51.7 percent), "municipal office buildings" (22.4 percent), "street lights" (10.3 percent) and others.
These results show that the installation of PV systems on educational facilities is most likely to increase in the public sector.
BOSTON - After years of inaction, a growing number of leading U.S. companies are confronting the business challenges from global warming, recognizing that greenhouse gas limits are inevitable and that they cannot risk falling behind their international competitors in developing climate-friendly technologies.
Some U.S. companies, such as General Electric, are catching up and joining DuPont and Alcoa in leading their industries.
But many others are still largely ignoring the climate issue with 'business as usual' strategies that may be putting their companies and shareholders at risk.
These are among the key findings of a first-ever report issued today by the Ceres investor coalition that analyzes how 100 leading companies are addressing the growing financial risks and opportunities from climate change-whether from expanding greenhouse gas regulations, direct physical impacts or surging demand for climate-friendly technologies.
Altogether, 76 U.S. companies and 24 non-U.S. companies in 10 business sectors are profiled in the report.
"More U.S. companies realize that climate change is an enormous business issue that they need to manage immediately," said Mindy S. Lubber, president at Ceres, which published the report Corporate Governance and Climate Change: Making the Connection.
"Investor pressure, expanding greenhouse gas limits and surging global demand for clean-energy products are compelling U.S. businesses to act, although many others still fail to recognize the enormity of this issue.
Ultimately, management and board members at all 100 of these companies need to make climate a top governance priority.
"
The report uses a "Climate Governance Checklist" to evaluate how major industrial corporations are addressing climate change in five broad areas: board oversight, management performance, public disclosure, greenhouse gas emissions accounting and strategic planning.
The report took nine months to complete and uses data from securities filings, company reports, company websites, third-party questionnaires and direct company communications.
Using a 100-point scoring system, the report ranked the largest companies in the oil/gas, electric power, auto, chemical, industrial equipment, mining/metals, coal, food products, forest products and air transportation sectors, with operations in the United States.
The scoring system gave most credit to companies with a sustained commitment to controlling greenhouse gas emissions, disclosing data and strategies, supporting regulatory actions, and taking practical, near-term steps to find lasting solutions to climate change.
Over two-dozen institutional investors requested the Ceres report, prepared by the Investor Responsibility Research Center, as part of an action plan announced at the Institutional Investor Summit on Climate Risk last May at the United Nations.
The investors are part of the Investor Network on Climate Risk (INCR), an alliance of U.S. institutional investors coordinated by Ceres that collectively manage about $3 trillion in assets.
"This report is extremely valuable because it provides investors with an unprecedented window into how companies most affected by climate risk are responding at the board level, through CEO leadership, and in strategic planning," said Connecticut State Treasurer Denise L. Nappier, whose $22 billion investment fund is among 50 institutional investors in INCR.
"While strong climate governance practices are not yet the norm at U.S. companies, this report plainly illustrates that there are industry leaders showing the way.
"
The report's overall results are encouraging.
In 2003, Ceres released a report on 20 companies showing that major U.S. businesses were doing little to address climate challenge.
By contrast, this report shows that leading companies in many key industries are now tackling the issue at the highest level, with boards conducting strategic assessments and management setting performance goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and developing new climate-friendly products.
DuPont, the leading scorer among U.S. firms has reduced its GHG emissions 72 percent since 1990 and developed forward-thinking commercial products such as energy-efficient building materials, components for solar, wind and fuel cell systems and next-generation refrigerants with low global warming potential.
The report also shows, however, that dozens of U.S. businesses in various climate vulnerable sectors - including leading electric power and oil companies - are still largely dismissing the issue or failing to articulate clear strategies to meet the challenge.
Low climate governance scores also were prevalent among entire sectors, including: coal companies, which are especially vulnerable to greenhouse gas regulations; food and forest product companies, which are vulnerable to natural resource impacts from climate change; and airlines, one of the fastest growing sources of CO2 emissions.
"I commend the companies that have willingly accepted the risks and opportunities that climate change presents.
America must be a leader in climate friendly technologies," said California State Treasurer Phil Angelides, a co-founder of INCR and board member at two of the nation's largest public pension funds, CalPERS and CalSTRS, which collectively manage more than $300 billion in assets.
"These findings - that a growing number of leading U.S. businesses are focusing on global warming - should be a wake up call to investors: we need to continue to press poor-performing companies to clean up their act.
"
Douglas Cogan, principal author of today's report and the 2003 report, says he sees important progress by U.S. companies that are beginning to build climate change into their governance practices and strategic planning.
In the past two years, Cogan cited such as examples as:
General Electric's launch of 'ecoimagination', a plan to double investments in climate-friendly technologies and reach $20 billion in annual sales by 2010.
These companies join others, like DuPont and Alcoa that have had climate change governance strategies in place for more than a decade.
Still, Cogan acknowledges that the challenge ahead for all companies, including BP and other leaders, is enormous, given that greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced substantially below current levels to stop rising global temperatures.
Businesses that are most successful in implementing climate change strategies, Cogan said, will be those that look beyond short-term thinking and the gridlock that currently grips Washington on this issue.
Company executives should benchmark their performance against their industry peers, and take steps outlined in the report to manage climate risks and opportunities and improve their governance scores.
European Plant Diversity is Threatened by Climate Change
Human-induced climate and atmospheric changes are affecting a wide variety of forms of life.
Being able to build models predicting the effects of climate change is of crucial importance to enable environment policy makers to engage adapted actions to reduce greenhouse gas emmissions.
An international team involving researchers from France, Portugal, South Africa, Sweden, and the United Kingdom has recently developed predictions on the potential effects of climate change on a sample of 1,350 plants, representative of the European plant species, for the period 2051-2080.
To build their predictions, the authors used four of the scenarios proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), namely scenarios A1, A2, B1, and B2.
These scenarios differ on their assumptions on the evolution of technology and economic and population growths.
The authors also assessed three climate models relating species distributions to bioclimatic variables.
However, only the most consensual model was considered for each scenario.
The authors used two hypotheses concerning the potential migration of plant species across Europe to find a more suitable climatic area for their survival: no migration and universal migration.
The “no migration” hypothesis was used to estimate the potential number of species losses after the disappearance of their climatic niche.
In contrast, the “universal migration” hypothesis was used to estimate the potential gains and turnovers of plant species following climate changes.
The results of this study led to great variations in predictions of plant species losses across scenarios.
However, the authors estimate that more than half of the European plant species could be vulnerable or threatened by 2080.
The authors also suggest that plant species losses and turnovers correlate two climatic key factors: temperature and moisture conditions.
Within a single scenario, authors report great variations across regions.
The obtained results suggest that plants in mountainous regions are the most vulnerable.
In contrast, plants in the Mediterranean and the Pannonian regions seem to be the most resistant to the effects of climate change.
The authors also identified a transition zone including the Boreal and Pannonian regions where great species mixing is expected to occur between 2051 and 2080.
This study has considered the potential consequences of different climate change scenarios on the survival of European plant species.
Its conclusions indicate that plant species are unevenly but substantially threatened by climate change.
Continuing the ongoing efforts to reduce greenhouse gases emissions could mitigate the climate change detrimental effects on the conservation of biodiversity.

(Newswire Today) — Guildford United Kingdom, 2006-03-11 - Less than a year after succeeding to the throne, Prince Albert of Monaco is swapping the luxury of his palace for the wilds of the North Pole to highlight global warming.
Albert represented Monaco at the last five Winter Olympic Games in their Bobsleigh team.
And he is going to face some cold and hostile conditions on his seven day trip to bring to the attention of fellow world leaders the environmental damage to the arctic regions that global warming is having.
But one of the first actions he took after succeeding to the throne was to sign the Kyoto Protocol, taking Monaco outside of the small group of countries that had failed to ratify the treaty, designed to reduce the world’s emissions of greenhouse gases.
In the most comprehensive survey ever undertaken of the massive ice sheets covering both Greenland and Antarctica, NASA scientists confirm climate warming is changing how much water remains locked in Earth's largest storehouses of ice and snow.
"If the trends we're seeing continue and climate warming continues as predicted, the polar ice sheets could change dramatically," said survey lead author Jay Zwally of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md.
"The Greenland ice sheet could be facing an irreversible decline by the end of the century.
"
Other recent studies have shown increasing losses of ice in parts of these sheets.
This new survey is the first to inventory the losses of ice and the addition of new snow on both in a consistent and comprehensive way throughout an entire decade.
The survey shows there was a net loss of ice from the combined polar ice sheets between 1992 and 2002 and a corresponding rise in sea level.
The survey documented for the first time extensive thinning of the West Antarctic ice shelves, an increase in snowfall in the interior of Greenland and thinning at the edges.
All are signs of a warming climate predicted by computer models.
The survey combines new satellite mapping of the height of the ice sheets from two European Space Agency satellites.
It also used previous NASA airborne mapping of the edges of the Greenland ice sheets to determine how fast the thickness is changing.
Researchers used nine years of elevation mapping over much of Antarctica and 10.5 years of data over Greenland from the European Remote-sensing Satellites 1 and 2.
The survey pinpointed where the ice sheets were thinning and where they were growing.
In Greenland, the survey saw large ice losses along the southeastern coast and a large increase in ice thickness at higher elevations in the interior due to relatively high rates of snowfall.
This study suggests there was a slight gain in the total mass of frozen water in the ice sheet over the decade studied, contrary to previous assessments.
According to Zwally, this situation may have changed in just the past few years.
Last month NASA scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., reported a speed up of ice flow into the sea from several Greenland glaciers.
That study included observations through 2005; Zwally's survey concluded with 2002 data.
"The melting of ice at the edges of the ice sheet is also increasing, which causes the ice to flow faster," Zwally said.
"A race is going on in Greenland between these competing forces of snow build-up in the interior and ice loss on the edges.
But we don't know how long they will be approximately in balance with each other or if that balance has already tipped in favor of the recently accelerating outflow from glaciers.
"
The situation was very different in Antarctica.
The ice sheets had a major net loss of ice due to outflow from West Antarctica.
These losses, which may have been going on for decades, outweighed the gains in snow and ice seen in the East Antarctic ice sheet and parts of West Antarctica.
Also thinning were the ice shelves around West Antarctica, where temperatures have been increasing.
The floating ice shelves are vulnerable to climate change.
Some ice shelves in the Antarctic Peninsula have totally disintegrated in recent years, allowing the ice from the land to move into the ocean faster.
When the scientists added up the gains and losses of ice from the Greenland and Antarctic sheets, there was a net loss of ice to the sea.
The Greenland ice sheet annually gained approximately 11 billion tons of water, while Antarctica lost about 31 billion tons per year.
The 20 billion net tons added to the oceans is equivalent to the amount of fresh water annually used in homes, businesses and farming in New York, New Jersey and Virginia.
"The study indicates that the contribution of the ice sheets to sea-level rise during the decade studied was much smaller than expected, just two percent of the recent increase of nearly three millimeters (0.12 inches) a year," Zwally said.
"Current estimates of the other major sources of sea-level rise - expansion of the ocean by warming temperatures and runoff from low-latitude glaciers - do not make up the difference, so we have a mystery on our hands as to where the water is coming from.
Continuing research using NASA satellites and other data will narrow the uncertainties in this important issue and help solve the mystery.

Africa's rivers face dramatic disruption that will leave a quarter of the continent severely short of water by the end of the century, according to a global warming study published on Friday.
In the first detailed assessment of climate change on the continent's waterways researchers found that watercourses on the continent are highly sensitive to shifts in rainfall patterns.
Even modest decreases in rain in western Africa will see rivers lose as much as 80% of their water, triggering a surge of what the scientists call "water refugees".
Maarten de Wit, a climate expert at the University of Cape Town who led the study, said the redrawing of Africa's waterways will pose serious political problems as people displaced by droughts are forced into other countries to be near water.
The study, which appears in the journal Science on Friday, is the first to identify how Africa's rivers will respond to climate change over the century.
The extent to which slight changes in rainfall could impact on rivers had never been realised.
The researchers used a computer to divide the continent into 1 000km wide squares and worked out the total length of streams and rivers in each block.
They used climate change models to calculate the expected changes in rainfall across the continent and the effect they would have on river levels.
The scientists found that in 75% of the countries, those that received between 400mm and 1 000mm of rain a year, shifts in rainfall caused larger than expected rises or falls in river levels.
In Harare a 10% drop in rainfall is expected to lead to an 81% drop in fresh water from rivers, a situation the scientists believe will be mirrored in Madagascar, eastern Zambia and Angola.
South Africa, which is experiencing a prolonged drought, can expect far less water from the Orange river.
A 10% fall in rain over Johannesburg and Bloemfontein will lead to a 70% drop in river levels.
The study predicts rain will increase over East Africa.
Climate change is expected to bring 10% more rain to Tanzania before the end of the century, boosting water course levels by 136%, while Somalia faces a 20% rise in rainfall, leading to more than a 1 000% increase in the water it receives from waterways.
However, increased rainfall could lead to more standing water, more mosquitoes, and widespread malaria.

Former US Vice President Al Gore has expressed his belief that tackling climate change presents the global community with an opportunity to unite around a shared moral purpose.
Mr Gore was addressing an audience of business leaders and opinion formers brought together by The Climate Group on the climate change crisis facing the planet.
At the start of his presentation, Mr Gore explained that in Chinese, the word crisis is represented by 2 characters, one meaning danger, one meaning opportunity.
His dramatic multi-media presentation addressed both these in the context of global warming.
Images and animation of the earth from space, of glacial retreat and shattering ice, of projected sea level rise and the shut down of the gulf stream were beamed onto the vast screen of London’s Imax cinema as the former Vice President explained the indisputable correlation between C02 and rising temperatures.
But Mr Gore did not dwell simply on the impacts.
He was clear that, as well as the economic opportunities associated with moving to a low carbon economy, action on this issue would present a much greater opportunity still – the chance to find a shared moral purpose.
According to Mr Gore, “this is a rare opportunity that few generations experience.
As we rise to the challenge of climate change the moral clarity and vision we develop will enable us to identify other problems masquerading as political problems that are in fact moral imperatives.
The opportunity is there for us to transform the way we go about our lives.”
Mr Gore’s presentation was given to a select audience of opinion formers, business leaders and company representatives gathered together by The Climate Group.
However, his message, and his mesmerising presentation, will soon be accessible on a much broader scale with the forthcoming release of the movie, An Inconvenient Truth.
There is an amazing amount of bullshit with regards climate change comming out of Australia, it beats event the USA at times, this therefore is a great piece of news from my point of view.
“The best way to make sure we reduce the flow of harmful greenhouse gases into the atmosphere is to legislate to make it happen.
“Anyone who believes that climate change is not a very real and present danger is kidding themselves and this Government will not walk away from its responsibilities to do all we can to combat it.”
> Trigger annual reporting by the Minister for Environment on progress with combating climate change.
The Premier, who recently assumed the role of Minister for Climate Change said he wanted the State to be second only to Denmark in the amount of wind generation it has in place.
Eminent climate change expert Californian-based Professor Stephen Schneider has just arrived in Adelaide as the State’s latest Thinker in Residence.
Premier Rann said Prof Schneider will provide advice on the development of the Government’s Climate Change legislation and will help finalise and implement the Government’s draft Greenhouse Strategy.
“We want Prof Schneider to help position South Australia as a leader in climate change prevention.”
The Premier also announced the Government will establish a Climate Change and Sustainability Research Centre at Adelaide University, with annual funding of $250,000.
The bill requires that emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases linked to global warming be reduced by 145 million tons, or 25 percent less than the current forecast, by 2020.
That would bring the emissions back to the 1990 level.
The gases in question are produced when fossil fuels are burned, whether in motor vehicles, power plants or other industrial facilities.
Many scientists have linked the growing concentration of these gases in the atmosphere to an observed increase in surface temperatures.
The legislation could have more than a statewide impact, because California has traditionally led the nation in pollution-control efforts.
Standards and rules established by the air control board have often been emulated by other states.
"The speaker said this bill was his top legislative priority this year," said Craig Noble, a spokesman for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group that is supporting the bill.
"The governor has said he wants to reduce emissions.
That means we have a very good chance of getting a first law in the nation to set statewide limits on emissions.

ExxonMobil says it recognises the risks of climate change
Oil and gas giant ExxonMobil says it recognises the risks of climate change
but gas fired power and technological advances hold the answer, not renewable resources or carbon trading schemes.
ExxonMobil Australia chairman Mark Nolan says the company does not believe climate change has been conclusively scientifically proven, but it is still taking the risk seriously.
Mr Nolan applauded the creation this year of the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate, made up of the US, Australia, China, India, Japan and Korea, which he said was focussed on finding technological solutions to climate change.
reductions in Australia can be achieved without high cost carbon taxes emission trading schemes but simply by levelling the playing field from a tax point of view and encouraging more gas in base load power generation,"

The Canadian prairies are facing an unprecedented water crisis due to a combination of climate warming, increase in human activity and historic drought, says new research by the University of Alberta's Dr. David Schindler, one of the world's leading environmental scientists.
Little research has been done on the cumulative effects of climate warming, drought and human activity on water shortages.
Schindler and Donahue found that the biggest threat was a combined one, made up of several ingredients.
First, there is now considerable evidence that the 20th century, when settlers arrived, was the wettest century for at least a couple of millenia.
What we think of as normal was not normal in the long-term.
"Most earlier centuries had one or more prolonged droughts, some of 10-40 years," said Schindler.
"So we should probably not expect a second wet century in a row.
"
Climate warming is a second factor that will exacerbate any droughts.
This new research shows that there is already a decline in glaciers that supply water to our rivers, snowpacks are dwindling and there is higher precipitation evaporation.
The western prairies have already warmed by two to four degrees and this is expected to double by mid-century, the researchers argue in the paper.
Although reducing greenhouse emissions would have the greatest effects several decades from now, it would have little short-term impact, says Schindler.
"We cannot replace the glaciers so our only alternative is to get very serious about water conservation and protection of the watersheds that supply our water," he said.
For example, it is imperative to use less water for agriculture through drought resistant crops or incentives for water conservation and to consider reusing water and low-flow devices as ways to conserve our supply.
We should also consider if and where we want population and industry to increase, said Schindler.
"As we show, the less water available to dilute pollutants, the more water quality problems we will see," said Schindler, adding parts of the southwest United States are currently experience water crises for the same reasons.
"I don't think we want to face the same problems Los Angeles or Phoenix has, but they will come unless we start protecting our water.
"
Many scientists say the world is moving closer to the point at which it will not be able to avert global warming disasters such as drastic climate upheavals and severe rises in sea levels.
There is still time, but stopping or delaying them will require bold changes by both individuals and the government, according to several climate scientists.
Either way, temperatures will rise for decades to come because the chief gas that causes global warming lingers in the atmosphere for about a century.
Nearly two dozen computer models agree that by 2100, the average yearly global temperature will be 3 to 6 degrees higher than now, said Gerald Meehl, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research.
A British conference with an aim, it said, of ''avoiding dangerous climate change" concluded last year that a rise of just 3 degrees would probably lead to some catastrophic events, especially the melting of Greenland's polar ice.
Those dangerous things include multicentury melts of polar ice sheets and an accompanying major sea-level rise, abrupt climate change from a dramatic slowing of the ocean current systems, and the permanent loss of glacier-fed ancient water supplies for China, India, and parts of South America.
Despite what scientists say, 70 percent of Americans think it is possible to reduce the effects of global warming, and 59 percent say their individual actions can help, according to a poll commissioned by Environmental Defense as part of its public service campaign.
Climate scientists find themselves trying to balance calculations that lead to scientific despair with public hope.
''I believe we are past the point of no return," he said.
''What does the point of no return mean?
To me, it means we've reached a point where we are seeing the impacts of global warming .
. .
The question is: How much worse is it going to get?
That is a case in which we can control our destiny -- if we act now.
"
Both Barnett and Walsh said the question they get most from the public is: What can I do personally about global warming?
They tell people to drive less and to drive fuel-efficient cars, and to be more vigilant about heating their homes.
Many scientists who have long been skeptics of global warming now acknowledge that Earth is getting hotter and that some of the heat is caused by people.
Even so, this minority of scientists, such as John Christy of the University of Alabama at Huntsville, say that the warming is ''not on this dangerous trajectory.

The Global temperature for the first 11 months of 2006 is 0.42 degrees Celsius above the 1961 – 90 global average temperature which makes it the sixth warmest year on record.
The Hadley Centre and Climatic Research Unit are forecasting the same temperature and position for 2006 as a whole.
These figures come from the Hadley Centre and Climatic Research Unit.
3 It makes more sense to say that since 2001 global temperatures have been very stable and more than half a degree Celsius above the global level until 1976.
In detail it can be said that 1997 and 1998 was a very warm period followed by a slightly cooler period in 1999 and 2000, the latter year being only the 12th warmest on record, and this has been followed by the present warm period.
According to James Hansen and others this last period is as warm as the Holocene optimum 7,000 years ago and the earth has not been warmer than this recent six year spell than for 130.000 years ago before the start of the last ice age.
4 NASA who had 2005 as the warmest year on record are saying this year is more than 0.2 degrees Celsius cooler than last.
No other climate unit is saying anything similar.
Certainly 2006 does not seem that much cooler than 2005 on a global scale I cannot accept this.
My view is that there is something wrong with the way the NASA figures are arrived at.
I do not accept either that 2005 was the warmest year on record, 1998 was the warmest.
5 Some say that Global Warming is taking off now.
This is untrue as far as surface temperatures are concerned.
They see rapid melt of mountain glaciers and think warming is taking off.
Mountain glaciers are melting rapidly because with global temperatures stable since 2001 melting carries on continuously.
As more land becomes snow and ice free the suns rays are absorbed rather than reflected, the albedo effect, thus local temperatures rise and more ice and snow melts.
Also of course most of the ice and snow, by area, on mountains is only just above the snow line so is very vulnerable to warming.. The area of this local warming is so small that it has very little effect on global temperatures.
My view is that at some point global temperatures will surge.
Global Warming is the greatest threat humanity faces.
I had expected global temperature to be warmer now than it actually is, but was clearly wrong.
It should be acknowledged however that there is a genuine sceptic argument which can say that if global temperatures have been stable for the last six years, and global temperatures have risen by 0.75 degrees Celsius in the last 100 years and 0.53 degrees Celsius in the last 30 years then clearly there has not risen as much as global warming theory suggests they ought to have risen.
This implies that the theory is wrong.
I don’t accept this myself but it is a valid argument.
We will here more of this until the global temperature rises significantly.
The Stern Review’s report on the economics of climate change published on 30 October 2006 is an impressive document that calls for action to meet a global challenge on a civilisational scale.
It is also unlikely – on present evidence – to have the effect required, for one simple reason.
Today’s vested political and economic interests are likely to prevent us from effectively addressing climate change, and so securing a decent future on this planet.
It’s ghastly, it sticks in the throat, and it’s awesome to think it even as I write it.
But it’s probably true.
So what is to be done?
Pragmatism and a hard-headed reading of history suggest that “the people” are unlikely to resolve our current crisis.
Far from it, we are more likely to degenerate into a toxic blend of hedonism and divided fundamentalisms.
Faced with an apparently insoluble problem, the citizens of the world will unite in partying until the curtain comes down.
This would involve rewarding political leaders who take a stand on climate change, who are willing to tell citizens the tough story, make enemies of those who would deny, and dedicate themselves to creating coalitions of the unwilling.
Such political leaders must be empowered, whether by the ballot-box or the amplifying effects of global civil society and the media.
And those leaders who choose to pipe an old tune, whoever and wherever they are, along with their advisors and sponsors, must be exposed in their naked splendour for all to see.
And that brings us to business leaders.
Business will not solve climate change by what it does not do; compliance will only ever be a marginal part of any serious solution.
Business will make a difference by what it does and does best: inventing, making and selling new products and services.
(That is why our Accountability Rating of the world’s largest hundred companies measures how smart rather than how moral they are in embedding social and environmental dynamics into their business models and practices).
Business cannot, and will not do this on its own.
Reshaping markets requires unlikely alliances between business, governments and civil society.
We have proven we can do this across such diverse challenges as labour standards, access to life-saving drugs, corruption and animal rights.
We can and must do it for climate change, reshaping the terms on which business is done to our collective good.
Perhaps then we need to bet on China for leadership.
We might point today to its dirty economy in more senses than one.
But China's culture and practice of decision-making is like no other, rooted in a history of long-termism.
Could it be that tackling climate change will be China's equivalent of the moai in the era of their creation: a powerful symbol of emerging leadership?
Whilst this may sound like an unfeeling solution to the climate change crisis, environmental groups in the west are warming to the carbon market’s potential.
Why? Because we need to reduce emissions dramatically in the next ten years, according to the world’s leading climate scientists.
With time so short, we have to go with the biggest tool we’ve got – the market.
Carbon trading is one of the mechanisms approved by the Kyoto Protocol for nations to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases.
The Kyoto Protocol created the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) to enable emissions being saved in one part of the world to be sold in another.
The result is a vast number of projects, mostly in developing nations, being certified for emissions reductions.
Renewable energy projects such as wind power are common.
These are checked to avoid ‘double counting’ and sold into one of a number of carbon markets from where the credits can be purchased.
The outcomes, in terms of environmental and social impact have been mixed so far, and the Kyoto Protocol is under fire for failing to deliver anything near the emission reductions the world needs.
Indeed global emissions are continuing to rise and few countries can claim to have bucked the trend.
But much has been learned since Kyoto and the learning curve is getting steeper.
The European Union has been operating an Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) since January 2005, with the first phase due to end in December 2007. beyond which the second phase will coincide with the first Kyoto commitment period which operates from 2008 to 2012 and requires signed-up developed nations to have reduced their greenhouse gas emissions by around 5% below their 1990 levels.
At its peak, the price for a tonne of carbon (CO2 equivalent) was above €30.
Currently it is hovering around €12.
At the present time, 44% of emissions in the UK are attributable directly to individuals, but the individual is not currently a player in the carbon market.
In a globalised carbon market, the initiative to reduce emissions may not stay with governments.
Companies and communities who recognise the scale of the threat of climate change to their own futures and the future of their families could themselves become the drivers.
Each year, to fight climate change, the carbon budget will have to shrink.
As the budget is shrunk, the goods and services required to meet the lowered targets will become available and affordable and a new low-carbon culture will continue to propel this change.
A new report from FAO says livestock production contributes to the world's most pressing environmental problems, including global warming, land degradation, air and water pollution, and loss of biodiversity.
Using a methodology that considers the entire commodity chain, it estimates that livestock are responsible for 18 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, a bigger share than that of transport.
However, the report says, the livestock sector's potential contribution to solving environmental problems is equally large, and major improvements could be achieved at reasonable cost.
Based on the most recent data available, Livestock's long shadow takes into account the livestock sector's direct impacts, plus the environmental effects of related land use changes and production of the feed crops animals consume.
It finds that expanding population and incomes worldwide, along with changing food preferences, are stimulating a rapid increase in demand for meat, milk and eggs, while globalization is boosting trade in both inputs and outputs.
Despite its wide-ranging environmental impacts, livestock is not a major force in the global economy, generating just under 1.5 percent of total GDP.
But the livestock sector is socially and politically very significant in developing countries: it provides food and income for one billion of the world's poor, especially in dry areas, where livestock are often the only source of livelihoods.
"Since livestock production is an expression of the poverty of people who have no other options," FAO says, "the huge number of people involved in livestock for lack of alternatives, particularly in Africa and Asia, is a major consideration for policy makers.
"
In the process, the livestock sector is undergoing a complex process of technical and geographical change.
Production is shifting from the countryside to urban and peri-urban areas, and towards sources of animal feed, whether feed crop areas or transport and trade hubs where feed is distributed.
There is also a shift in species, with accelerating growth in production of pigs and poultry (mostly in industrial units) and a slow-down in that of cattle, sheep and goats, which are often raised extensively.
Today, an estimated 80 percent of growth in the livestock sector comes from industrial production systems.
Owing to those shifts, the report says, livestock are entering into direct competition for scarce land, water and other natural resources.
Deforestation, greenhouse gases.
The livestock sector is by far the single largest anthropogenic user of land.
Grazing occupies 26 percent of the Earth's terrestrial surface, while feed crop production requires about a third of all arable land.
Expansion of grazing land for livestock is a key factor in deforestation, especially in Latin America: some 70 percent of previously forested land in the Amazon is used as pasture, and feed crops cover a large part of the reminder.
About 70 percent of all grazing land in dry areas is considered degraded, mostly because of overgrazing, compaction and erosion attributable to livestock activity.
At the same time, the livestock sector has assumed an often unrecognized role in global warming.
Using a methodology that considered the entire commodity chain (see box below), FAO estimated that livestock are responsible for 18 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, a bigger share than that of transport.
It accounts for nine percent of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions, most of it due to expansion of pastures and arable land for feed crops.
It generates even bigger shares of emissions of other gases with greater potential to warm the atmosphere: as much as 37 percent of anthropogenic methane, mostly from enteric fermentation by ruminants, and 65 percent of anthropogenic nitrous oxide, mostly from manure.
Scientists usually tie their estimates of the greenhouse gas emissions responsible for global warming to sources such as land use changes, agriculture (including livestock) and transportation.
The authors of Livestock’s long shadow took a different approach, aggregating emissions throughout the livestock commodity chain - from feed production (which includes chemical fertilizer production, deforestation for pasture and feed crops, and pasture degradation), through animal production (including enteric fermentation and nitrous oxide emissions from manure) to the carbon dioxide emitted during processing and transportation of animal products.
Livestock production also impacts heavily the world's water supply, accounting for more than 8 percent of global human water use, mainly for the irrigation of feed crops.
Evidence suggests it is the largest sectoral source of water pollutants, principally animal wastes, antibiotics, hormones, chemicals from tanneries, fertilizers and pesticides used for feed crops, and sediments from eroded pastures.
While global figures are unavailable, it is estimated that in the USA livestock and feed crop agriculture are responsible for 37 percent of pesticide use, 50 percent of antibiotic use, and a third of the nitrogen and phosphorus loads in freshwater resources.
The sector also generates almost two-thirds of anthropogenic ammonia, which contributes significantly to acid rain and acidification of ecosystems.
The sheer quantity of animals being raised for human consumption also poses a threat of the Earth's biodiversity.
Livestock account for about 20 percent of the total terrestrial animal biomass, and the land area they now occupy was once habitat for wildlife.
In 306 of the 825 terrestrial eco-regions identified by the Worldwide Fund for Nature, livestock are identified as "a current threat", while 23 of Conservation International's 35 "global hotspots for biodiversity" - characterized by serious levels of habitat loss - are affected by livestock production.
Two demands.
FAO says "the future of the livestock-environment interface will be shaped by how we resolve the balance of two demands: for animal food products on one side and for environmental services on the other".
Since the natural resource base is finite, the huge expansion of the livestock sector required to meet expanding demand must be accomplished while substantially reducing its environmental impact.
Land degradation: Restore damaged land through soil conservation, silvopastoralism, better management of grazing systems and protection of sensitive areas.
Greenhouse gas emissions: Sustainable intensification of livestock and feed crop production to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from deforestation and pasture degradation, improved animal nutrition and manure management to cut methane and nitrogen emissions.
Water pollution: Better management of animal waste in industrial production units, better diets to improve nutrient absorption, improved manure management and better use of processed manure on croplands.
Biodiversity loss: As well as implementing the measures above, improve protection of wild areas, maintain connectivity among protected areas, and integrate livestock production and producers into landscape management.
Removal of price distortions at input and product level will enhance natural resource use, but may often not be sufficient.
Livestock's long shadow says environmental externalities, both negative and positive, need to be explicitly factored into the policy framework.
Livestock holders who provide environmental services need to be compensated, either by the immediate beneficiary (such as downstream users enjoying improved water quantity and quality) or by the general public.
Services that could be rewarded include land management or land uses that restore biodiversity, and pasture management that provides for carbon sequestration.
Compensation schemes also need to be developed between water and electricity providers and graziers who adopt grasslands management strategies that reduce sedimentation of water reservoirs.
Likewise, livestock holders who emit waste into waterways or release ammonia into the atmosphere should pay for the damage.
Applying the "polluter pays" principle should not present insurmountable problems for offenders, given the burgeoning demand for livestock products.
Information, communication and education will play critical roles in enhancing a "willingness to act".
With their strong and growing influence, consumers are likely to be the main source of commercial and political pressure "to push the livestock sector into more sustainable forms", Livestock's long shadow says.
Already, growing awareness of threats to the environment is translating into rising demand for environmental services: "This demand will broaden from immediate concerns - such as reducing the nuisance of flies and odours - to intermediate demands for clean air and water, then to the broader, longer-term environmental concerns, including climate change and loss of biodiversity".
Intensive animal production systems produce high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus wastes and concentrated discharges of toxic materials.
Yet those systems are often located in areas where effective waste management is more difficult.
The regional distribution of intensive systems is usually determined not by environmental concerns but by ease of access to input and product markets, and relative costs of land and labour.
In developing countries, industrial units are often concentrated in peri-urban environments because of infrastructure constraints.
The idea was floated in a speech in the summer, but the detailed proposals show Mr Miliband is serious about trying to press ahead with the radical idea as a central part of his climate change strategy.
The study also claims that individual carbon trading is less regressive than carbon taxes, as the poor emit less than the rich.
Instead of flat "green" taxes it proposes a hybrid system using permits and taxes, with the permits possibly issued, tracked and traded through the existing banking system using pin and chip technology.
Carbon allowances could be treated as bank accounts.
The need for urgent action on climate change is beginning to be reflected in the corporate world, albeit not in a uniform pattern.
In presenting a break-out session on climate change, Sue Hall posed the question of whether climate change can make markets restructure, particularly in light of the Stern Review Report which highlighted the fact that there may well be inadequate private capital to meet the costs of climate related catastrophes.
In the aftermath of Katrina, the US government need to appropriate $28 billion for flood risks.
Gary Guzy of Marsh, the insurance firm, remarked that insurers are withdrawing from property insurance in coastal areas.
Consequently, Florida's largest insurer is the State Fund.
Responsibility for mitigating climate change has been well received by companies such as Sun Micro and UTC.
John Mandyck of Carrier Corporation, a UTC company, cited that energy produces 85 per cent of all emissions and, in the US, the average home has increased in size by 60 per cent over the past fifteen years.
This is an important consideration as 30 per cent of energy usage in the US is due to air-conditioning.
Therefore, they are aiming to launch new goals to achieve a 20 per cent reduction in energy usage.
Dave Douglas at Sun estimated that IT "can wipe out all the climate gains made through having platinum star green buildings" as powering all the IT systems produces a billion tonnes of CO2 worldwide.
This has prompted Sun to develop Ecoservers which, if certain "market issues" were addressed, would provide a benefit to consumers in terms of offsetting the reduction of their footprint.
Truman Semans of the Pew Centre stated that in assessing corporate activity on climate change, many companies were not transparent on the returns their emissions reductions programmes have brought.
However, in asking companies to list the most effective strategies, energy conservation always comes out on top.
In terms of the highest impact on a company's NPV (net present value), these are usually perceived as regulatory.
Integrating climate into a broader sweep of business strategy therefore seems to make a valuable business case, especially if extended to value-chain partnerships and biofuels.
Yet, as Sun's Douglas stated, they are "being affected by regulatory uncertainty," especially when it comes to assessing environmental and climate regulations in deciding where is best to build as new factory.
In an unprecedented action, representatives for more than 10,000 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency scientists are calling on Congress to take immediate action against global warming, according to a petition released today by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER).
The petition also calls for an end to censorship of agency scientists and other specialists on topics of climate change and the effects of air pollution.
The petition stresses that time is running out to prevent cataclysmic environmental changes induced by human-caused pollution and urges Congress to undertake prompt actions:
“If we wait, we will be committing the next generation of Americans to approximately double the current global warming concentrations, with the associated adverse impacts on human health and the environment.”
The filing of this petition coincides with today’s oral arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court on a case (Massachusetts v. EPA, Case No.
05-1120) brought by states seeking to force the Bush administration to regulate greenhouse gases that fuel global warming under the Clean Air Act [see previous post].
“EPA’s scientists and engineers [must be able] to speak frankly and directly with Congress and the public regarding climate change, without fear of reprisal.”
“Professionals working for the Environmental Protection Agency are protesting being ordered to sit on the sidelines while we face the greatest environmental challenge of our generation,” stated PEER Executive Director Jeff Ruch, noting that the petition began among agency staff.
“Under a new Congress, perhaps the scientists at EPA can begin to directly communicate with their true employers – the American public.”
MONTREAL, Dec. 2 -- In a convention that underscored the rising political weight of climate change issues, Canada's Liberal Party on Saturday chose St?phane Dion, a former environment minister, to lead the party and try to wrest power from the ruling Conservatives in the next national election.

The [US] Building Sector Unites to Confront Global Climate Change
Recognizing that the Building Sector is responsible for almost half of all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions annually, key leaders in this Sector have banded together to confront the global-warming crisis.
Last week, the American Institute of Architects (AIA), U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC), American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), Architecture 2030 and about 20 other leaders attended a special meeting at the 2006 Greenbuild International Conference and Expo, a conference presented annually by the USGBC.
According to Rick Fedrizzi, President, CEO & Founding Chairman of USGBC,
"Eliminating the built environment negative contribution to climate change is not just a strategic priority, it's our collective responsibility to generations to come.
Science tells us we have 3650 days to meet that goal, and urgent action is required.

Nine young protesters from the climate action group Plane Stupid Scotland have this morning shut down Aberdeen airport by setting up a golf course on the taxiway.
They have surrounded themselves with fortified security fencing whilst another group are occupying the roof of the terminal building and have unfurled a banner reading, “Nae Trump Games with Climate Change”.
The peaceful protest began at 02.15am this morning whilst the runway was closed.
Plane Stupid aims to prevent the scheduled reopening of the runway at 5am.
The group intends to maintain its blockade for as long as possible to prevent the release of thousands of tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere.
Donald Trump is supporting the expansion of Aberdeen airport where his super-rich friends will arrive to play golf on his controversial golf course.
BAA Aberdeen said they welcome Donald Trump's Golf Course.
Like Alex Salmond, Trump wants to bulldoze over democratic opposition to environmentally damaging projects like airport expansion.
Both Trump and BAA’s plans face fierce local opposition.
“We have been failed by the generation of Donald Trump and Alex Salmond.
Despite a catalogue of scientific reports warning them that they can’t keep on with aviation growth – even if that hinders their ability to jet in for a weekend of golf – they continue with disregard for all of us, who will end up dealing with the impacts of the climate crisis.”
“Alex Salmond wants to let the Spanish shareholders of BAA, Donald Trump and his super-rich American friends concrete over Scotland and its efforts to stop runaway climate change.”
“Arctic ice is melting, the sea is already rising and experts warn the world’s rainforests could collapse.
Our generation is already starting to feel these impacts as the warming kicks in so it’s obvious that it’s going to need to be us that urgently puts the brakes on expanding unnecessary airports.”
The campaigners chose to close Aberdeen after the Scottish government gave its backing to the expansion of capacity at the airport by 1.5 million passengers by 2015.
Aviation is Britain's fastest growing source of emissions, already amounting to at least 13% of the UK's climate emissions.
With plans in the Scottish government’s ‘National Planning Framework’ for growth at Scottish airports including Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen - as well as Heathrow and Stansted - experts from the Tyndall Centre for climate research say aviation policy alone will scupper any chance the UK has of hitting its climate targets.

Stop Climate Chaos is working with WWF-UK, RSPB, Christian Aid, Oxfam, Tearfund, Greenpeace, CAFOD, Green Alliance and others to enable people around the country to Ask The Climate Question and put climate change firmly on the election agenda.
By supporting The Wave you sent a strong message to Gordon Brown and other world leaders that we need ambitious carbon emissions reductions by 2020 (based on 1990 levels) from industrialised countries.
If all the industrialised nations only make a 30% reduction, we'll be gambling on a 50:50 chance at best of keeping global warming below the 2 degrees C danger level.
The EU are currently proposing only a 20% reduction.
Whilst this may sound like an unfeeling solution to the climate change crisis, environmental groups in the west are warming to the carbon market’s potential.
Why? Because we need to reduce emissions dramatically in the next ten years, according to the world’s leading climate scientists.

Apparently, it seems that our good hopes to mitigate Global Warming by purchasing carbon offsets are not having the effect that they should have to.
Is our money going through a black hole to finance carbon offsets providers operations or is it going to financially support the eco-projects that we expect?
Recently, reports show a lack of transparency in the carbon offset retail market and we might find that a good cause has been used for some organisations to cash on the Global Warming crisis.
UK figures are available in CarbonSMS.com and you are free to decide whether online carbon offset providers are cashing on the Global Warming crisis or not.
A good guidelines on what to ask carbon offsets providers before buying is also available.
The comparative table shows their range of products carbon offset prices, sales volume by organisation, and prices per tonne in the UK.
It is surprising that prices in different carbon offset British websites range from £7.40 to £9.00 tonne/CO2.
In the US the same tonne of CO2 costs £1.50.
This seems a bit scandalous because this could mean that we pay more without making a real benefit on the environment and therefore we might be paying in excess administrative, marketing, shareholders and investors expenses.
Is the price this offfset providers charge really the cost of the eco-project?
or Is the money being taken by intermediaries?
How much money are they taking from our pockets that really has a proven benefit on the environment or poor communities?.
It seems that this market needs more disclosure of information so consumers can evaluate the offset quality, where the money goes, how the projects are selected and benefits they provide to the environment and communities.
It will be dangerous and sad to see that our hopes to mitigate Global Warming by offseting our emissions are not helping as they should while the time to reverse this crisis goes by.
Carbon offsetting should be considered as one option amongst a portfolio of actions that each of us should take to reduce our emissions and not the only one to make us feel good.
Generally carbon dioxide trading is abreviated to carbon trading.

Telling people not to destroy the planet is an oversimplified way of describing what people working on climate change issues often do.
Major changes are ahead and if we are to develop our vision we need to understand how climate friendly policies effect the wider social agenda.
There is perhaps no clearer example to this than restructuring cities and developing new models of urban transport.
A book on this very topic, removing cars from cities, has just arrived at my doorstep today.
I`m yet to start this formidable looking text as i`m to busy reading 'Homage to Catalonia' and 'The Price of Fire'...neither of which have anything to do with climate change but a fair bit to do with revolutions (the Spanish and the Bolivarian).
As climate change shows no signs of going away, more and more organisations are offering information and analysis on the topic, as well as ways of collaborating online.

This morning I recieved an email about a conference soon to be held in London on the security implications of climate change.
Usually I`m pleased to hear of a new sector of society taking climate change seriously, but in this case no comfort is brought to me by the fact that the military are starting to see an emerging global threat.
This is perticularly the case since that threat is drawn from the expectation of hundereds of millions of newly dispossesed and poverty stricken environmental refugees.

ISET is an international partnership for implementation, education and research on natural resources & the environment.
More plainly, they are an organisation who have produced reports on water management, adaptation to increased risk of flooding, and the policies required for combining development and adaptation to climate change.
In general many developing nations, perticularly those not as far along the path of development as china, see adaptation to climate change as there big challenge.
Looking at the growth of some of these nations will lead many in the west to hope that this will change.
The continuing widespread poverty in many areas of Asia, is perhaps masked by such gross statistics as GDP growth that we are bombared with.

The IIED is based in London and do a great deal of important work focused on "Mainstreaming Adaptation".
Clearly a fair degree of climate change is already locked in and whilst we may not be justified in assuming complete failure by nation states in curbing there emissions it is abudently clear that there has been a period of political domancy that is going to hit the poorest hard.
Adaptation stratagies are therefore a very real requirement for the comming century, nowhere more so than on the marginal grazing lands of Africa's Sahel.
Infact, as mentioned previously the possibility for conflict driven by climate change is only to real.

Sustainable Automobile Transport (SAT) is a good title for a recent book by, Lisa Ryan and Hal Turton, on motorised transport.
The title is appropriate as it stretches the idea of sustainability beyond its sensible definition, reflecting a major flaw in the book.
The aim implied by the subtitle 'Shaping Climate Change Policy' is inevitably damaged by this basic mismatch between more sustainable technology and real sustainability.
In it's most elementary form sustainability is the ability to continue without coming up against the physical limits of a system.
Being 'more sustainable' in the context of carbon emissions is just taking a more gradual path towards destabilisation of the climate.
I was left with the feeling that i hadn't seen a real path towards sustainability, the real conclusion to be drawn is that automobile transportation is an inherently unsustainable sector and that a more holistic approach that includes mass transit, planning and public education is required.
SAT therefore fails in it's main objective but actually offers a very good guide to the more humble task of guiding us towards the most effective policies and combinations thereof to reduce the climatic impact of this highly significant sector.
SAT first shows signs of bulking at the scale of the problem we face in the introduction where it states that “Long-term environmental stress is mitigated significantly.
In particular, carbon emissions at the end of the are approximately at or bellow today's levels”.
Considering that conservative estimates suggest a 60% reduction in GHG emissions globally by 2050 is required a stabilisation of emissions from the transport sector isn't relevant to climate policy.
The focus on a horizon going out to 2100 is also insufficiently urgent, climate scientists tell us that the next 20-50 years is the key challenge.
It is inconceivable for this reader to contemplate discussion of long term energy scenarios without explicit reference to carbon budgets resultant globa l temperature changes.
In conclusion, i feel that SAT is a useful book for those working on policies for automobile management, either working for government or for NGO's.
For people generally interested in the transport sector and solving it's climate change related issues i would recommend a book taking a inter-modal approach.
I also offer words of caution to those who would use this book as a guide to the future of automobile development, this is all rather uncertain at present.
This book is problematic in several ways.
Firstly, there is a lot of generalisation about environmentalism: there are many people working on issues that effect the environment that don't see themselves as environmentalists.
Secondly, the attacks on existing movements do seem a bit to vicious to be simply constructive criticism.
Indeed the references to Nietzsche and and defence of the poorly understood concept of will-to-power, and of hubris, may leave some questioning just how much arrogance they can stomach.
By including humans in our vision as post-environmentalists we can broaden our sights and increase success politically.
This change involves taking on non-environmental ends as part of our mission, this is crucial for making an issue as vast as climate change politically sustainable.
A focus along the lines of Hawkens, Lovins and McDonugh should act as a focus for this new politics.
A society of economic uncertainty, inequality and poverty is not conducive to action on climate change or other issues that have similar results as climate change.
We must build a movement to counter these issues, which are consistently at the top of opinion polls ans strongly relevant to elections.
Part of this should be a huge state led programme of investment in energy research.
I agree with Nordhaus and Schellenburger on much of this.
Point 1. is the nub of the essay.
There is a call for, not a claim of, The Death of Environmentalism.
The reasons being that the conceptual box 'environmentalism' is no longer the best one for serving our values.
Point 2. is in my view an answer to the question of how we approach climate change, either as a technocratic or a systemic issue, the case made seems to be that a technocratic based approach would see the issue as pollution based, but that in order to make the requisite scale of change we need to activate people and businesses behind a positive vision that is more than simply against something bad, it is for something incredibly new and positive.
Point 3. gives us some direction on a post-environmental movement.
It relies on the case built throughout the early part of the book that environmentalim at its most successful was not counter cultural, but a part of generosity of heart that abounded at times of prosperity and optimism, a time when progressive politics was universally dominant in the US.
At the time of Live Earth a book appeared in my mail box the "Global Warming Survival Handbook" by David De Rothschild.
This book aims to highlight the way that people can contribute to keeping our earth as a Live Earth.
The Handbook is broken down into four primary sections Food and Shelter, Survival Strategy, Energy and Transportation, and Work and Commerce.
I like these categories particularly the 'Survival Strategy' section which is more about attitudes and behaviour than the rather superficial actions that these books tend to focus on.
Having said that, there are a whole range of ways to reduce personal emissions as part of the book, from buying compact fluorescent to counting your food miles or using your bike to get to work.
Although 'survival strategy' adds something to the book it fails to give sufficient credit to people who are likely to buy a book on climate change, De Rothschild misses a trick in talking about behaviour change, consumer preference, and not small p politics and activism.
Overall the Handbook is a good guide to greening your life.
If you are interested in reducing your emissions and have been making attempts here and there, then this is a good place to look for a more comprehensive guide to personal action on climate change.
If you feel that there has to be more than changing your lifestyle and your consumption habits in order to effect change then congratulations you are a true believer in democracy (and therefore dangerous).
This is not the book for you but keep looking and good luck in taking power back and giving political passivise a smack in the face!
The Global Warming Survival Handbook is available on Amazon ($10.17) here .
Climate change, a christian perspective, an argument for action on climate change based on our common humanity.
The Great Warming is a facinating fresh perspective on the problem of climate change.
We don't have the flash graphics and the head on approach of An Inconvenient Truth; we have a very nicely put together documentary about the impacts of climate change, focusing on human health, agriculture and personal stories.
This angle, along with the neutral term Great Warming, does well to move past the negative association that many US christians have with environmentalism.
It seems obvious to many that climate change is a moral issue, perhaps to obvious for the comfort of those of us involved in this issue within a secular society.
The involvement of the chirstian community therefore makes perfect sense, but how to get this 'creation protection' started?
The great warming is a superb start, it's suitability for church groups and it's solutions based approach are most wellcome!
"We are living at the dawn of a new age – an era of changing climate, erratic weather, and social calamities that could change our way of life forever.

There are a great variety of magazines and journals covering so called Green issues.
Which of these reading materials are of interest is a very personal matter; are you more interested in lifestyle changes, environmental policy in your country, international progress on climate mitigation, the science of climate change, broader sustainability issues or perhaps a purely financial focus.
So if you are interested in a smart and creative business approach to climate change along with the latest development is Green policy then I highly recommend going over to the Forum for the Future website, checking out a few articles and buying that subscription...or maybe a Christmas present for someone else?
Climate change: a problem that is far more abstract that we would like.
One possible way to remove this perception of the abstract is to explore in detail where the droughts, the flooding and the biodiversity loss is going to be lost.
The atlas of climate change is devided into 7 sections covering; the signs of change, forcing change (geek for changes in the greenhouse effect), driving climate change (emmissions from transport), expected consequences, responding to climate change, commiting to soloutions (personal and public action) and climate change data.
Very much a reference work I cant see to many people sitting down and reading this from cover to cover.
It is however a very useful and accesible reference work.
If you are a climate activist wishing to make your point about the importance of engaging china in the dialogue, or a educator trying to get across the injustice of UK emmissions, or even a policy maker trying to make country by country comparisions this is a great place to start.
The atlas does a good job of combining detailed maps and images with larger trends: on one page we are shown how rising sea levels will affect various regions of the globe by 2100, ranging from over 90 million being inundated in india and pakistan to fewer than a million in east africa; on another page we are shown one of the instances of inundation, a 1m rise in sea level could devestate the nile delta and destroy 15% of egypts arible land.
Beyond the maps a good general introduction is given to the basics of climate change and the whole emissions situation is clarified.
One point that I found perticularly interesting was that only 53% of post 1750 GHG emmisions where co2 and that heating and electricity only currently constitutes 21% of co2 emissions, i had always thought that co2 from power generation would be THE primary cause of climate change, trends are pushing in that direction but it is infact only one of many contributors, the scale of emmissions from landuse change and agriculture is really significant.
For anyone interested in climate change and wanting to understand our challenge better I can really recomend this book.
I intend to keep this by my side, every time I write anything about energy use and trends this will be my first port of call to see if a more detailed look would be useful.
The Atlas of Climate Change is writen/researched by Kirstin Dow , Associate Prof. University of South Carolina and Thomas E Downing , director SEI in Oxford.
For those of us working on climate change, it is often apparent that a surreal disconnect exists between our perceptions of the risks we face and the actions of those in wider society.
How often have you walked out of a conference—where the deadly effects of climate change have been eloquently outlined—and looked around in amazement at the ungrounded masses?
Planes fly off to the USA for weekend breaks, 4x4's drive by on the two mile school run, people appear oblivious to the impending climate crisis.
In reality this disconnect is untenable because climate change won't only affect environmentalists, we have Just One Planet and we all have to do our part to avoid destroying it.
Marks book 'Just One World—Poverty, Justice and Climate Change' covers basic climate science, adaptation strategies and policy frameworks for dealing with problem in a just manner.
Whilst the introduction to climate science is reasonable it isn't anything new for people with a interest in climate change.
The real strengths of the book are in it's examination of vulnerabilities, its explanation of adaptation strategies (particularly how these can be synergistic with development), and it's look at international climate policy.
The danger represented by climate change varies depending on location, the key factors being the physical impacts of climate change and the ability of the local populous to adapt.
The worst impacts of climate change will be felt in sub-Saharan Africa and in parts of Asia.
It therefore looks likely that in many cases the physical impacts will be heaped on the most vulnerable.
Vulnerability of a society is not simply dependant on its degree of wealth but also on how its industries will be impacted.
In developing countries such as Tanzania, Bangladesh the primary industries are agriculture, forestry and fishing, constituting 44% and 23% of revenues respectively.
In the developed world, even where agricultural activity is significant its input in terms of GDP is not, in the USA and the UK levels are 1.5 and 1% respectively.
This disproportionate vulnerability is a key problem for climate negotiations , particularly when paired with the fact that the wealthiest 20% of the world are responsible for 63% of historic emissions and the lowest 20% just 3%.
But far from being simply a record of climate injustice and its institutionalisation Just One Planet goes on to elaborate on how mitigation, adaptation and development can all be effectively integrated in the developing world.
With a focus primarily on the LDCs and with significant reference to the work of Practical Action (ITDG), Just One Planet makes some genuinely important remarks on the real threat to humanity that climate change presents us with.
We can't fail in our fight against climate change as to do so would be to abandon billions to the long term poverty, the mellenium development goals are nothing but pipe dreams if we don't take rapid mitigation and adaptation seriously.
Currently the adaptation funds have been pledged less than half a billion dollars, considering that for example protecting the coast of Tanzania will cost 15 billion, these pledges are utterly disproportionate with the severity of the situation.
For anyone with an interest in climate policy, development work or campaigning I can thoroughly recommend this book .
From a personal perspective I found the chapter on international policy offered the greatest selection of ideas that where new to me, particularly the malfunctioning of the CDM, the arbitrary basis for the three adaptation funds and the barriers that prevent proper integration of adaptation and development.
In 'Big Coal' the author, Jeff Goodell, takes a critical look at coal power.
The book is divided into three stages; getting coal out of the ground and to the power station, burning that coal and finally, the consequences of this carbon in the atmosphere.
Looking at coal power generation Jeff shows quite clearly that besides greenhouse gases and electricity the biggest output from this form of generation is political power--power that is not constrained by wires.
Later we are informed that coal produces over twice the carbon dioxide emissions of natural gas per unit energy--taken with the previous statement this is not a good combination.
In the first section of the book many of coals' most potent myths are crushed.
Chief amongst these myths is that 'clean coal' technology is clean.
People are dying in there thousands, landscapes are being decimated by mountain top removal, climate change is being accelerated at an alarming rate.
Coal isn't a small health problem.
During the last three years--incidentally 3 of the 4 hottest years on record--72'000 people died prematurely as a result of coal fired power pollution, that is more than died from Aids, murder or drug overdose.
Carbon Dioxide is pollution.
No technology that emits huge amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere can legitimately be called clean.
Destabilisation of the global climate is already killing tens of thousands and will have an increasingly severe toll on the worlds people and environment.
The main reasons for reading this book would have to be the superb short stories; tales of valiant efforts by republicans who actually care to put in place strong regulations, tales of industrious scientists working out the links between particulate pollution and deaths, tales of very many smart people being hampered by very many highly resourced people with vested interests.
This is a fascinating and enlightening book, despite the darkness of its subject matter.
2005 was one of the worst years for natural disasters in the United States, setting an unprecedented cost of over $121 billion in damage, with over 1460 deaths.
Since the day that Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf coast, scientists have uncovered sobering evidence that these natural disasters are becoming more common and severe.
"We conclude that global data indicate a 30-year trend toward more frequent and intense hurricanes, corroborated by the results of the recent regional
assessment.
This trend is not inconsistent with recent climate model simulations
that a doubling of CO2 may increase the frequency of the most intense cyclones.

"Recent warming coincides with rapid growth of human-made greenhouse gases.

"We found that the mass of the ice sheet decreased significantly, at a rate of 152 ± 80 cubic kilometers of ice per year [about 37 ± 20 cubic miles per year],which is equivalent to 0.4 ± 0.2 millimeters of global sea-level rise per year.
"
Geophysicists Isabella Velicogna and John Wahr of the University of Colorado,Boulder, reported in Geophysical Research Letters how … between 2002 and 2004, GRACE [the satellite] found a loss of about 82 cubic kilometers [about 20 cubic miles] of ice per year.
"
"Accelerated ice discharge in the west and particularly in the east doubled the ice sheet mass deficit in the last decade from 90 to 220 cubic kilometers per year [about 22 to 53 cubic miles per year].
As more glaciers accelerate farther north, the contribution of Greenland to sea-level rise will continue to increase.
[…] Glacier acceleration in the east probably resulted from climate warming.

LABOUR MPs are threatening to throw Gordon Brown’s flagship Bill to tackle climate change into chaos, in the latest backbench revolt.
They are backing a Friends of the Earth protest that a climate change law leaving out emissions from planes and ships is like “a drink-driving law that doesn’t count whisky”.
Crucially, the 56 rebels are enough to defeat the Prime Minister when the Climate Change Bill goes to a Commons’ vote next Tuesday.
Friends of the Earth’s Big Ask campaign for a tougher climate change law is also backed by Radiohead singer Thom Yorke, who said: “MPs have a chance to fix this when they vote on the law next week.
“We are on the verge of getting the world’s first climate change law.
This is an amazing achievement, but there is one very large elephant in the room – it doesn’t cover pollution from ships or planes.”
The Government’s position, backed by the Climate Change Committee it set up, is that it is near-impossible for countries to share out responsibility for the gases produced from international flights and shipping.
Climate Change and Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has already bowed to pressure by increasing – from 50 per cent to 80 per cent – the Bill’s commitment for carbon emission cuts by 2050.
Mr Griffiths said he was “very encouraged” by discussions with Climate Change Minister Joan Ruddock, suggesting the Government might give way.
There is no single instrument measuring climate change.
Instead there are thousands of measuring devices spread across the globe, on land, under the sea and in the air.
The climate system is a complex, interactive system consisting of the atmosphere, land surface, snow and ice, oceans and other bodies of water, and living things.
The atmospheric component of the climate system is what we generally refer to as climate: climate is often defined as ‘average weather’.
Climate is usually described in terms of the mean and variability of temperature, precipitation and wind over a period of time, ranging from months to millions of years (the classical period is 30 years, see weather and climate for more information on the difference between these two).
Countless empirical tests of numerous different hypotheses have now built up a massive body of Earth science knowledge.
This repeated testing has refined the understanding of many aspects of the climate system, from deep oceanic circulation to stratospheric chemistry.
Sometimes a combination of observations and models can be used to test planetary-scale hypotheses.
For example, the global cooling and drying of the atmosphere observed after the eruption of Mt.
Pinatubo provided key tests of particular aspects of climate models.
Climate science in recent decades has seen an increasing rate of advancement, particularly in field research and notably through the evolution of measuring climate change methodology and tools, including the models and observations that support and enable the research.
During the last four decades, the rate at which scientists have added to the body of knowledge of atmospheric and oceanic processes has accelerated dramatically.
As scientists incrementally increase the totality of knowledge, they publish their results in peer-reviewed journals.
There are a number of key factors in measuring climate change, and they are broadly categorised below.
The range of instrumentation used to observe and measure climate is truly amazing.
By following the links below you can see the types of instruments, and where they are used.
Temperature When measuring climate change this is a primary and can be measured or reconstructed for the Earth's surface, and sea surface temperature (SST).
Precipitation (rainfall, snowfall etc) offers another indicator of relative climate variation and may include humidity or water balance, and water quality.
Biomass and vegetation patterns may be discerned in a variety of ways and provide evidence of how ecosystems change to adapt to climate change.
Sea Level measurements reflect changes in shoreline and usually relate to the degree of ice coverage in high latitudes and elevations.
Solar Activity can influence climate, primarily through changes in the intensity of solar radiation.
Volcanic Eruptions, like solar radiation, can alter climate due to the aerosols that are emitted into the atmosphere and alter climate patterns.
Chemical composition of air or water can be measured by tracking levels of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, and measuring ratios of oxygen isotopes.
Research indicates a strong correlation between the percent of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the Earth's mean temperature.
In understanding global climate changes it is necessary to combine many disciplines, including oceanography, meteorology, geomorphology, geology and paleoclimatology.
As well as combining interdisciplinary studies, observations and measurements can be assembled over long time spans, using different measuring approaches.
For example, the annual averages of the global mean sea level seen below are based on reconstructed sea level fields since 1870 (red), and the tide gauge measurements are since 1950 (blue) while the satellite altimetry is since 1992 (black).
The units are in millimetres relative to the average for 1961 to 1990 and the error bars are at 90% confidence intervals.
Superficial or amateurish acquaintance with the current state of a scientific research topic is an obstacle to a scientist’s progress.
Working scientists know that a day in the library can save a year in the laboratory when measuring climate change.
Good science questions competing assertions about climate change.
For example, can the statement under consideration, in principle, be proven false?
Has it been rigorously tested?
Did it appear in the peer-reviewed literature?
Did it build on the existing research record where appropriate?
If the answer to any of these questions is no, then less credence should be given to the assertion until it is tested and independently verified.
The history of the centuries-long effort to document and understand climate change is often complex, marked by successes and failures, and has followed a very uneven pace.
Testing scientific findings and openly discussing the test results have been the key to the remarkable progress that is now accelerating in all domains, in spite of inherent limitations to predictive capacity.
Climate change science is now contributing to the foundation of a new interdisciplinary approach to understanding our environment.
Consequently, much published research and many notable scientific advances have occurred in the last few decades, including advances in the understanding and treatment of uncertainty.
Uncertainties associated with ‘random errors’ have the characteristic of decreasing as additional measurements are accumulated, whereas those associated with ‘systematic errors’ do not.
In dealing with climate records, scientists give considerable attention to the identification of systematic errors or unintended biases arising from data sampling issues and methods of analysing and combining data.
There are currently around 38 flights per day between Manchester and the London hubs.
Climate activists argue that these are the most unnecessary flights of all because there are easily available alternatives such as the train, which produce a lot less carbon emissions.
Phil Thornhill from Campaign against Climate Change said "As unprecedented flooding devastates Pakistan, record temperatures stoke raging wildfires around Moscow and torrential downpours cause landslides that kill thousands in China - it’s time we got serious about the escalating threat from climate change before it’s too late.
Aviation symbolises the high-emission lifestyles of the developed world that are threatening billions, especially in the most vulnerable communities, around the world.
We can start to get to grips with the growth in aviation by eliminating the shorter journeys that can be made in other, less carbon intensive, ways.
"
Local Manchester councillor Martin Eakins who will be attending the demonstration said, "Aviation from Manchester Airport contributes more greenhouse gasses than all other polluters put together in Manchester.
Reducing our carbon output by ending domestic flights would go a long way to making our city environmentally sustainable.
"
Robbie Gillett from the ‘Stop Expansion at Manchester Airport’ coalition said "There are currently around 38 flights per day between Manchester and the London hubs.
Airlines such as Flybe who promote these domestic flights are encouraging airport expansion and threatening the stability of the climate in order to line their own pockets.
These flights are the most unnecessary of all and should stop immediately.
Instead, we need to create green jobs in sustainable transport networks such as rail.
"
Anne-Marie Griffin, Chair of ‘Fight the Flights’ at London City Airport said: "An end to unnecessary domestic flights for trips which could be taken by train, would have a hugely positive impact on the residents around London City Airport.
Not only would they experience less flight noise and pollution from City Airports' domestic flights, but also from those heading to Heathrow.
Travellers taking the train instead of the plane could help improve the lives and health of thousands of Londoners.
"
I often find it hard to put into words what it is that I do want, especially when the things that we are fighting against appear more immediate.
However last weekend’s Camp for Climate Action outside RBS headquarters in Edinburgh reminded me what I would like to see in the future.
Community.
Climate camp has a strong sense of interdependence and a genuine sense of community.
People look out for and support each other, which we saw at Edinburgh when protestors stuck together in stressful situations and made quick decisions as a collective.
Empowerment and self reliance.
So many people are disempowered, and feel like they are unable to do something unless they have trained in a particular area.
Climate camp is a space where people learn by doing, and within hours you will find yourself putting up a giant marquee or cooking for a hundred people.
Grow Heathrow is part of a budding land movement in the UK connecting struggles to take back control of our food production.
In building resilient communities to environmental and economic crises we want to defend real alternatives to the systems of false democracy and corporate greed.
Nine Plane Stupid protesters who shut down Aberdeen airport on the morning of March 3rd 2009 appeared in court today to finally receive their sentences.
The judge and court took the protesters' urgent message on climate change seriously and gave out very modest fines ranging from £300 to £700 each.
During the two week trial in June, expert witnesses explained how aviation emissions are fuelling climate change and detailed some of the local, national and international effects, such as the impact of flooding on Scottish communities.
Since the trial the Climate9 has also received support from communities around the world, suffering from climate change effects.
The nine defendants have vowed to continue their campaign highlighting the danger of aviation carbon emissions.
Dan Glass, one of the Climate9 members said: "Against the backdrop of the Copenhagen Summit failures and new waves of climate chaos, all over the world people demanding climate justice have complained to the politicians and to the judges.
It’s time we did something for ourselves.
The Climate9 will not uphold increasing state and police repression and camouflage the struggle that is climate injustice.
"The Climate9 provide an opportunity to spread the need for urgent action, to halt airport growth and to challenge the authorities with pride and confidence.
Whatever we received today, this climate court trial won't be the last time.
Our future and the health of every species is too important to leave it in the hands of the few.
"
Two days before sentencing one of Britain's best-known defence barristers also threw his weight behind the Climate9.
Michael Mansfield QC said, "As I write one fifth of Pakistan, already blighted by earthquakes, is covered with flood waters threatening the health and safety of over six million people.
Without conscientious and principled protest which focuses on the undoubted factors which contribute to this decimation of the environment, the urgency of the problem will not be addressed.
I trust these entirely legitimate and selfless objectives will be reflected in the way the Climate 9 are judged by the court.
"
Summary: A successful Development and Adaptation Days at COP-11 was held December 3 and 4, 2005, in the Conference Centre of Guy Favreau Complex, Montreal.
More than 200 people attended sessions on the links between climate change and development, the implication of climate change for health and disaster management, adaptation science, community-based adaptation, and National Adaptation Programs of Action.
Development and Adaptation Days has become an anticipated part of each Conference of the Parties—an opportunity for the international climate change and development communities to share new approaches, explore common concerns and further adaptation efforts in developing countries.
brought together practitioners, negotiators, scientists and policy-makers to explore key issues related to adaptation to climate change in developing countries;
provided an occasion to share the latest developments and information on climate change and development linkages; and
facilitated greater collaborative links between the climate change and development communities.
Climate change refers to the variation at a global or regional level over time.
It describes the variability or average state of the atmosphere or average weather over time scales ranging from decades to millions of years.
These variations may come from processes internal to the Earth, be driven by external forces (e.g.
variations in sunlight intensity) or, most recently, be caused by human activities.

With Peter DeMenocal, Gavin Schmidt, Maxx Dilly and Klaus Lackner.
Just as weather patterns change from day to day, the climate changes too.
This occurs naturally, driven by internal and external factors.
However not all changes are due to natural processes, as we humans have also exerted our influence, which is called anthropogenic climate change.
Through widespread use of land, use of fossil fuels and the building of cities, we have changed our climate.
The major technological and socioeconomic shift of the industrial era with reduced reliance on organic fuel, the accelerated uptake of fossil fuels, and broad scale deforestation, means we have contributed to the natural greenhouse effect.
There are already people who have become climate refugees, and millions more are expected in the future.
Temperatures across the globe are most certainly rising; the 1990s was the warmest decade in the last thousand years.
Sea surface temperatures have increased 0.4-0.8°C (0.7-1.4°F) since the late 19 Century, and over the period 1961 to 2003, global ocean temperature has risen by 0.10°C (0.18°F) from the surface to a depth of 700 m.
Warming of a few degrees seems inconsequential compared with day to day, or seasonal variations in temperature.
However, in global terms it is much larger than any of the climatic changes experienced during the past 10,000 years, since the rise of agriculture and civilisations.
Although the Earth has seen many climatic changes during its 4.6 billion year history, the current changes are spurred by the human burning of fossil fuels.
In addition to warming of the Earth’s surface, there has been an increase in heatwaves, warming of the lower atmosphere and deep oceans.
There are fewer frosts, permafrost is melting, glaciers are retreating and sea ice is decreasing.
Sea levels have risen 10–20 cm and there is increased heavy rainfall in some regions, and less in others.
Climatic changes over recent decades have already affected some health outcomes.
The World Health Organisation estimated, in its "World Health Report 2002", that climate change was estimated to be responsible in 2000 for approximately 2.4% of worldwide diarrhoea, and 6% of malaria in some middle-income countries.
Epidemics of weather and climate-sensitive infectious diseases such as malaria and meningitis will have a devastating effect on human health and socio-economic development and severely overburden health systems in many parts of the world.
The Fourth Assessment Report released in 2007, by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) stated that “there is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities”.
As seen below, The Report also shows why there is cause for deep concern:
Sea Ice - Declining sea-ice extent and thickness.
The previous Australian Government, whilst not signing the Kyoto Protocol have acknowledged, “The projected global warming of a few degrees in the 21st century would occur at a time that is already one of the warmest for hundreds of thousands of years, with current levels of carbon dioxide not exceeded for the past 420,000 years, and not likely during the past 20 million years".
A few degrees of global warming will lead to more heat waves and fewer frosts.
More wildfires and droughts are expected in some regions of the world with higher rainfalls and resultant flooding in other areas.
Higher latitudes of the globe would receive more rainfall while middle latitudes, including parts of Australia, are likely to receive less.
For these areas the changes will pose significant problems for water resource management.
Tropical hurricanes and cyclones may become stronger and sea levels will rise over the coming decades.
Some low-lying coastal areas and islands are already feeling the effect, and will be more prone to inundation from storm surges.
Human induced climate change is another major stress in a world where natural and social systems are already experiencing pollution, increasing resource demands and unsustainable management practices.
The organisers of Climate Camp, a protest group that has previously demonstrated at coal power stations and Heathrow airport, have chosen London's financial centre as the target of their main summer protest this year.
The decision to target the City is aimed at throwing a spotlight on the carbon trading system, one of the central planks of the EU's attempts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from businesses.
Carbon trading in the US is also being pushed by the Obama administration, but the activists say they want to highlight the failure of the mechanism to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Cap and Trade, Green Tax Switch, Ineqaulity and International Climate Funds.
"I suggested taxing pollution more and income less.
Income tax would be
reduced most at the lower levels of income to overcome the regressive nature of a carbon tax.
This 'green tax switch'is one no brainer that every country
The EU has had an emissions trading scheme for some time, the first revision was absurdly overallocated so the price of credits fell through the floor.
We will have and wait to see how this develops, one of the major changes going forward is the movement towards a auction based system.
The system is also becoming broader.
With the US likely to adopt a similar system soon it's important to take a look at what works and what dosent.
The New America Foundation, the Pew Centre for Global Climate Change and the World Resources Institute have produced a series of 10 (6 currently available) detailed videos looking at every aspect of effective emissions regulation.

A disturbing amount of the climate justice movement’s “action” is taken alone, within our own homes.
We sit at our computers and post, Tweet, comment and write op-eds.
We call our Senators and legislators.
We change our light bulbs and insulate our homes (literally and figuratively.
) The picture that naturally develops in our minds is of little me, sitting here fighting the world’s biggest corporations and their political stooges.
That’s a pretty discouraging picture.
One of the biggest hesitations that seem to stop people from taking strong political action to fight climate change is a lack of empowerment.
Nobody wants to put his or her ass on the line for something that won’t make any difference, and we all know that the actions of a lone, isolated individual seldom make much of a difference.
Many brilliant writers have commented on how our hyper-individualized society exacerbates our biggest problems.
In the case of the climate movement, hyper-individualism causes potential activists to feel alienated from the incredibly powerful force of a united movement.
Recently I was talking with a friend who does really inspiring social change work with athlete volunteers.
He remarked that one of the great things about working with athletes is their innate competitiveness: athletes plan and play to win– whether it’s on the playing field or towards their goals for social change.
Which got me thinking about the climate community… Are we playing to win?
Do we expect to win?
What, and when?
And are we planning backwards from those goals?
And who are “we,” anyway?
Comments, please!
Last week saw the culmination of the Quebec Climate Action Camp , the most recent in a series of similar events around the world .
Climate Camps look different in different places, but the general idea is to bring together like-minded people from around a region to build common strategies, share skills, and take ACTION!
The Tar Sands have been a focal point this year; in the UK Climate Camp brought together activists challenging the Royal Bank of Scottland’s investments in the Canadian gigaproject.
Here in Dunham, Quebec, climate camp was set up to challenge a pipeline coming through this community.
The proposed pipeline is called the Enbridge Trailbreaker project, and would bring dirty tar sands bitumen to Montreal and then down to Maine, eventually ending on tankers heading to refineries in the Gulf Coast.
The camp brought together activists from across Quebec, Ontario, the Northeastern US, and beyond, to learn about the intersections of climate and social justice issues, and plan out how to best work together in the coming year.
Participants cooked, fed, and set up camp outside and were able to build lasting relationships between various communities to talk about how to build a climate movement.
The two-week climate camp ended with a march to the proposed pumping station for the pipeline.
Local community member and climate camp participants rallied at the proposed site.
“Our objective is to unite in order to act on the root causes of climate change.
It is the right time to denounce and block the Trailbreaker project.
Local communities and ecosystems cannot afford more oil spills, like that in the Gulf of Mexico.” says Pierre-Olivier Parent, a Climate Action Camp organizer.
Check out some of the media stories about the camp here , and stay up on Quebec action from Climate Justice Montreal
Ready for a road trip?
Now, I know, traditionally a road trips is the type of thing us fossil-fuel saving climate advocates are supposed to avoid, but this one is for a good cause, I swear.
Starting next week, Bill McKibben and a group of Unity College students will drive one of Jimmy Carter’s original White House solar panels from its current home in Maine back to the White House.
Better yet, the van they’re driving it runs on bio-diesel, so emissions won’t be as high as they could be.
You can stay up to speed with the road trip by visiting our Put Solar On It website.
Putting up panels on the White House is just a small step, but it comes with a clear message for Obama: now’s the time to show some real leadership on clean energy and get to work solving the climate crisis.
It is time for the national climate and social justice movements to converge side by side with the movement for justice in Appalachia, join us at Appalachia Rising.
Monday I watched as over 150 people marched through downtown San Francisco on the 5th anniversary on one of our country’s most devastating natural disasters, Hurricane Katrina.
The energy, if not anger, of the crowd was palpable.
Many in the march were asking the same question: why does it seem, five years later, we are calling for the same solutions we were calling for five days after Katrina?
The answer is because Big Oil has continues business as usual, and it’s booming.
In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, a most sobering example of what climate change can produce, Big Oil has only increased their record profits and decreased renewable energy investments (or in BP’s case stops it all together ).
When speaking to marchers, protesters, and business folks passing by on their lunch break about big oil’s responsibilities’ in the Gulf -and around the world- two climate culprits came up more than any other, Chevron and BP.
People weren’t surprised that Chevron was the largest off-shore leaseholder in the Gulf and folks certainly knew of BP’s oil spill.
People knew who is responsible, and they wanted to hold them accountable, But they struggled with how.
Why: The previous clean energy and climate agenda has collapsed, and the United States needs a new generation of thought leaders to challenge conventional wisdom and reshape the next agenda.
It’s Getting Hot in Here is the voice of a growing movement.
A community media project, it features the student and youth leaders from the movement to stop global warming and to build a more just and sustainable future.

I named this post communicating climate change as the links are all either directly or indirectly from the Fynmense blog which uses these words.
Of course, the idea of simple communication being possible is interesting.
If we think that modern day media is that neutral then we are beyond naive.
If this where our only problem then I think we would have things licked...all we would need to do is a bit of basic education.
However, although I can quite easily explain climate change, its impacts, our responsibility and our possible responses; I can rarely persuade people that there participation is required and that this is not merely a personal interest.
If we where being honest, it is apparent that my problem is that i cannot sell conceptual products.
I need to be better not at communicating but at marketing climate change.
We would also admit that the news media are superb at selling ideas to there chosen demographic and that what they need to do is accept this.
Climate change must be discussed as an urgen human problem with very real and feasible human fixes the media must be prepared to constructively engage in spreading this message.
Dr Rajendra K Pachauri assumed his current responsibilities as the head of TERI (Tata Energy Research Institute) in 1981.
In April 2002, Dr Pachauri was elected Chairman of the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), which was established by the World Meteorological Organization and United Nations Environment Programme in 1988.
Pål Prestrud is the current director of CICERO (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research – Oslo) and vice chair of ACIA (Arctic Climate Impact Assessment).
He holds a doctorate in biology from the University of Oslo, and his previous positions include division director for the Division of Science and Technology at the Research Council of Norway, research director at the Norwegian Polar Institute, and deputy director general at the Section for Polar Affairs and Cooperation with Russia, Department for International Cooperation at the Ministry of the Environment.
Jules Boykoff holds a Ph.D. in political science.
His work on U.S. media coverage of global warming, which he co-authored with Maxwell Boykoff (Oxford University, Environmental Change Institute), has appeared in a variety of scholarly and popular publications.
Al Gore used their research in his film and book “An Inconvenient Truth”.
Boykoff teaches political science at Pacific University in the United States.
Who ever would’ve guessed that there would be a Labor Day card for global warming.
But that is what SomeEcards are for:
In a terrific March presentation , Climate scientist Katherine Hayhoe has a figure of what staying on the business as usual emissions path (A1F1 or 1000 ppm) would mean (derived from the NOAA-led report):
It is obvious that the conditions met by the early explorers such as Vitus Bering, Fridtjof Nansen, Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld and Roald Amundsen no longer exists.
We passed through in a few weeks, while our predecessors were forced to overwinter once or even twice.
Still, it is not an easy passage for any kind of boat or vessel.
There is still ice, although not to the extent there used to be, but plenty to make conditions unpredictable for ships.
In addition many of the seas you have to pass are very shallow.
In the East Siberian Sea, the shipping lane is located 50 nautical miles off the coast, in order for there to be sufficient depth for bigger ships.
Lights, buoys and nautical markings are scarce.
That’s from a blog posting by Thorleif Thorleifsson, captain of the “Northern Passage,” offering his “reflections” from the Chukchi Sea.
He notes in an update,”The water temperature is 7.5 degrees.
If we weren’t sailing, it would be a great temperature for a swim!” [He means degrees Celsius, of course.
] And that’s why the ice can keep melting even after the air temperature goes below freezing.
Here’s a video from the ship, with the caption, “In the dark of night, on the Chukchi Sea off Wrangel Island, three men steer the “Northern Passage” past ice floes and icebergs.
Persistence and caution is demanded every moment of their journey!
Look no further than today to get a glimpse of what the future holds if we continue with business as usual: Record temperatures in the United States, Europe, and Canada; wildfires and hurricanes in Russia; and flooding in Pakistan and China.
Climate change is here and there’s more to come.
Thousands of lives have been lost, and millions of people have been displaced from these recent disasters.
But the economic tolls are also hurting businesses.
CAP’s Rebecca Lefton and Richard W. Caperton have the story in this cross-post from the Center for American Progress.
Economists estimate that Russia’s economy will lose $15 billion this year from the country’s recent disasters—a full percentage point of its expected GDP growth.
About half of that loss will come from agriculture and the rest from “lower industrial output, lower demand and lower productivity.” Russia had been gaining ground from a 7.9 percent GDP loss last year, but shoppers are staying home to avoid the toxic smog and heat during the hottest summer on record.
Offices are closing and factories are shutting down.
Stu Ostro, Senior Meteorologist at the Weather Channel, has become quite good at explaining the link between global warming and extreme weather — see “ Weather Channel expert on Georgia’s record-smashing global-warming-type deluge “:
… there’s a straightforward connection in the way the changing climate “set the table” for what happened this September in Atlanta and elsewhere.
It behooves us to understand not only theoretical expected increases in heavy precipitation (via relatively slow/linear changes in temperatures, evaporation, and atmospheric moisture) but also how changing circulation patterns are already squeezing out that moisture in extreme doses and affecting weather in other ways.
The World Meteorological Organization says this “unprecedented sequence of extreme weather events … matches IPCC projections of more frequent and more intense extreme weather events due to global warming.” NASA says July 2010 is “What Global Warming Looks Like.”
Top climate scientists — Peter Stott, head of climate monitoring and attribution at UK’s Met Office and Kevin Trenberth, head of climate analysis at the National Center for Atmospheric Research — have been making the link between the record-smashing extreme weather and human caused global warming (see here )
Denizens of Washington DC are reeling from a catastrophic storm that knocked out power for 100,000, toppled trees, and flooded streets.
Much of the Gulf Coast is under flood warnings, and the central United States is sweltering under 110-degree heat, following an early summer of record heat and rainfall across much of the United States.
Severe weather fueled by global warming pollution is having an even more devastating impact around the world:
How hot is it?
So hot that even the status quo media is waking up to the fact that human emissions of greenhouse gases are changing the climate and causing record-smashing extreme weather events, just as scientist predicted decades ago.
At the end is a discussion of the science of Hell and High Water in pieces by NCAR’s Kevin Trenberth, The Met Office’s Peter Stott, and Jeff Masters — along with links for those who want to donate to help out in the “massive humanitarian crisis in Pakistan.” For more background, see “ Intro to global warming impacts: Hell and High Water .”
One of America’s most influential global warming skeptics, CNN meteorologist Chad Myers, has finally admitted that global warming is “caused by man.” Brad Johnson has the story .
ON TUESDAY, AUGUST 10, 2010, at 11 a.m. EDT, in advance of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s world grain harvest estimate on Thursday, environmental analyst Lester Brown will discuss the heat and drought currently decimating Russia’s grain crops, what Russia’s loss on grain exports means for world food prices and how this calamity foreshadows future climate-related crises.
Sharp and long-lasting declines in soil moisture over much of the planet’s habited landmass are a major prediction of climate science, something I’ve called “DUST-BOWL-IFICATION” (since readers pointed out to me that many deserts really aren’t so bad).
Here’s what the recent scientific literature says we face in the second half of the century if we stay anywhere near our current emissions path:
Russia is being devastated by extreme weather — and their leaders aren’t silent on what they think the cause is.
On Thursday, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev spoke to a Russian Security Council meeting on the ongoing threat of wildfires associated with the country’s heatwave and drought:
None of us can say what the next summer will be like.
The forecasts vary greatly.
Everyone is talking about climate change now.
Unfortunately, what is happening now in our central regions is evidence of this global climate change, because we have never in our history faced such weather conditions in the past.
This means that we need to change the way we work, change the methods that we used in the past.”
Well, everyone is talking about climate change is now — except maybe major U.S. media outlets like the New York Times.
The NYT reports today :
Russia banned all exports of grain on Thursday after millions of acres of wheat withered in a severe drought, a portentous decision at a time when crop failures caused by heat and flooding span the northern hemisphere.
And the Times goes on to explain that wheat prices have “increased about 90 percent since June because of the drought in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and parts of the European Union, and floods in Canada.” But it is all just random series of coincidences to the Times (see “ As nation, Russia, and world swelter under record-smashing heat waves, The NYTimes sets one-day record for most unilluminating stories “).
“What’s happening with the planet’s climate right now needs to be a wake-up call to all of us, meaning all heads of state, all heads of social organizations, in order to take a more energetic approach to countering the global changes to the climate.”
That’s Dmitri Medvedev, President of a country that has been mired in even more disinformation about global warming than ours, as Time notes .
On Friday, Medvedev said that in 14 regions of Russia, ”practically everything is burning”:
And so we have Hell and High Water, with Pakistan’s record flooding displacing millions : “The disaster has killed 1,200 people and there are fears that the death toll will rise steeply.
There are reports of cholera outbreaks among some victims as doctors treat a number of waterborne diseases”:
Our favorite climate de-crocker , Peter Sinclair has two — count ‘em!
— new videos for this endless summer, taking on Inhofe, Christy, and the global cooling myth:
So, naturally, the NY Times is out with what would, for any other paper, be one of its worst climate stories ever, but which is just run-of-the-mill dreadful for the former paper of record (see here )?
The Tom Zeller’s piece , “Is It Hot in Here?
Must Be Global Warming,” buries the one crucial scientific fact that eviscerates its entire narrative:
The study itself slams the “deniers” for trying to spin the storms as inconsistent with human-caused global warming:
Since both NASA and NOAA report we are in fact experiencing record-smashing global heat this year, much as the climate scientists have predicted, the youth coalition Consequence decided to mock Inhofe by puting up a giant ice sculpture that quickly melted.
Here is CNN’s video:
When climate camp protesters descended on the site of the Kingsnorth power station for a week-long summer demonstration, the scale of the police operation to cope with them was enormous.
Papers acquired by the Liberal Democrats via Freedom of Information requests show that the 1,500 officers policing the Kingsnorth climate camp near the Medway estuary in Kent, suffered only 12 reportable injuries during the protest during August.
A separate breakdown of the 33 patients treated by the police tactical medicine unit at the climate camp shows that three officers had succumbed to heat exhaustion, three had toothache, six were bitten by insects, and others had diarrhoea, had cut their finger or had headaches.
"I hope the government and the police will now stop trying to portray peaceful protesters as somehow equivalent to terrorists or violent extremists.
In light of this new evidence, one has to ask, were climate campers so heavily policed because they posed any genuine threat of violence, or because they posed a challenge to government policy?
"
Nick Thorpe, a spokesman for the climate camp, said: "Policing of peaceful protest has become increasingly heavy-handed.
We saw thousands of officers swarming around a legal camp in a colossal waste of public money.
The police and the government claimed there was a 'violent minority' of protesters but this Home Office admission reveals this as a complete fiction.
"
Kingsnorth, a power station built 45 years ago on the Medway estuary in Kent can burn oil as well as coal.
Two years ago its owner, the energy company E.ON UK, announced plans to build two "cleaner coal units" there.
The new plants are the focus of protest for climate-change activists who believe the development will discharge carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases at too high a level.
The Kingsnorth development will involve the first purpose-built, coal-fired power stations in the UK since completion of the Drax station in Yorkshire in 1986.
E.ON claims the majority of the local population favours the project, and says a carbon capture and storage system "could eventually see 90% of its emissions captured and stored underground".
The company insists its port facilities on the Hoo peninsula and its own fleet of colliers will let it easily import low-sulphur coal.
The new plants are meant to be operational in 2012.
Of Kingsnorth, Greenpeace says: "[It will] emit the same amount of CO2 as the 30 least polluting countries in the world combined, and destroy any chance we have of persuading China and India to stop building coal plants.
"
The UN High Commissioner for refugee reports that climate change is exacerbating conflicts that are displacing 37 million people - and rising.
They warn that this is the beginning of a trend.
No shit.
Something similar has happened with the idea of 'climate security' the connection between climate change and conflict seems to be quite a lively topic of discussion that i have largely missed.
Joshua Busby of the Council on Foreign Relations authors a November 2007 report about Climate Change and National Security.
I`m uncertain at best about how he frames the issues, but if you are interested in how Al Gore won the Nobel Peace Prize then this is part of your explanation.
The Institute of Policy Studies has just released a report comparing US expenditure on military and climate defence.
Needles to say that the US is spending vast sums on arms and military wages while spending virtually nothing on preventing the destabilisation of the global climate, which promises to cause mass migration, resource conflict and a wide range of other malodies.
"We will devote 50 times as much to arming the rest of the world as to helping it prepare for and avoid global climate catastrophe.

This morning I recieved an email about a conference soon to be held in London on the security implications of climate change.
Usually I`m pleased to hear of a new sector of society taking climate change seriously, but in this case no comfort is brought to me by the fact that the military are starting to see an emerging global threat.
This is perticularly the case since that threat is drawn from the expectation of hundereds of millions of newly dispossesed and poverty stricken environmental refugees.
"This technology is the only rational response to abrupt climate change,"
Climate change and poverty in Africa, two key foci of Tony Blair during last July's G8 meeting.
Two foci, but one issue according to economicst Jeffery Sachs, head of the Earth Institute at Columbia University.
He told reporters that the international community would need to come up with a global framework for dealing with growing migration caused by droughts, floods and other disasters linked to climate change.
With the current situation deteriorating by the day little mention is being made of the climate, such avoidance of the truth is damaging for action on climate change and therefore damaging to our prospects of avoiding many more such situations in the future.
Agriculture is an essential component of societal well-being and it occupies 40 percent of the land surface, consumes 70 percent of global water resources and manages biodiversity at genetic, species and ecosystem levels.
At every point of production, agriculture influences and is influenced by ecosystems, biodiversity, climate and the economy, including energy trade.
Modern agriculture is a fossil fuel energy-intensive industry and its development is tightly linked to energy factors.
While the successes in agriculture production over the last half decade are heralded, the inequitable benefits and unsustainable impacts on natural resources are becoming more evident.
Undoubtedly, the acceleration of environmental degradation and climate change has direct effects on agricultural productivity and food security.
There is no global challenge facing humanity that is more important than managing the earth’s environment to assure that it can sustain life in all its forms.
The ecological balance on which current and future generations depend can only be preserved through food chains that balance energy and nutrient flows.
The challenge is to balance the competing demands of different users of the same resources and of managing the resources to optimise the benefits to be derived on a sustainable basis.
Over the past 50 years, humans have changed ecosystems more rapidly and extensively than in any comparable period of time in human history.
Between 1960 and 2000, the demand for ecosystem services grew significantly as the world population doubled to 6 billion people and the global economy increased more than six fold.
To meet these growing demands, food production increased by roughly two-and-a half times, water use doubled, wood harvests for pulp and paper production tripled and timber production increased by more than half.
Approximately 60 percent of our ecosystems are being degraded or used unsustainably, including: capture fisheries, water supply, waste treatment and detoxification, water purification, natural hazard protection, regulation of air quality, regulation of regional and local climate, regulation of erosion and aesthetic enjoyment.
Degradation of ecosystems is likely to grow significantly worse over this century.
A series of recent assessments have indicated that the target of the World Food Summit to reduce the number of food insecure persons is not being met and that, despite the signing of major environmental agreements, carbon emissions continue to rise, species extinction is continuing and desertification continues to be of great concern in arid, semi-arid and sub-humid areas.
With an increasing global population and overall purchasing power, more food calories are required while the availability of the necessary biotic and abiotic (nonliving) production factors is shrinking: land is being converted to non-food production systems, water resources are scarcer, and climate change plus shrinking biodiversity are threatening the viability of farming in various settings.
In the future, climate change is expected to accelerate many pressures on the wild environment, as long-established production systems become destabilised and abiotic stress (such as water shortages, salinity, aridity and heat) are increased, always in the light of a growing demand for food.
Furthermore, the expected increase of biofuel and bioplastic feedstock monoculture production may lead to increased rates of genetic erosion.
These changes pose great challenges because biodiversity is the raw material that breeders use to create the new crop varieties that will be needed to safeguard biodiversity for food and agriculture for future generations as well as maintaining a broad gene pool, which ensures ecosystem resilience.
Using the results from formal economic models, the Stern Review estimates that in the absence of an effective counteraction, the overall costs and risks of climate change will be equivalent to losing at least 5 percent of global GDP each year.
If a wider range of risks and impacts is taken into account, the estimates of damage could rise to 20 percent of GDP or more, with a disproportionate burden and increased risk of famine on the poorest countries.
The costs of extreme weather events, including floods, droughts and storms are already rising, including for developed countries.
Without action, millions of people could become refugees as their homes and lands are hit by drought or flood.
Climatic factors like solar energy and water are essential to agricultural production as they constitute major environmental resources.
World agriculture and forestry practices (e.g.
conversion of wetlands to agriculture, deforestation, rice paddies, cattle feedlots, fertiliser use) today contribute about 25 percent to the emissions of greenhouse gases reduce carbon sinks and change hydrological cycles, thus exacerbating climate change effects.
In turn, the increasing frequency of storms, drought and flooding has implications on the viability of agro-ecosystems and global food availability.
Agriculture and forestry can be part of the solution by contributing to climate change mitigation, through carbon conservation, sequestration and substitution, and establishing ecologically designed agricultural systems that can buffer extreme events.
Through carbon sequestration, agriculture and forestry can also contribute to implementing the Kyoto Protocol.
Climate change issues are tightly linked with energy policies.
There is an urgent need to assess the feasibility of selected bioenergy systems based on countries’ needs and resource endowments, to ensure food security is not compromised by fuel demands.
Policy makers, planners, researchers and operators must consider the larger energy economy that is now tied closely to agriculture.
Energy efficiency of the total system, despite rapidly shifting prices, is an important goal.
Farmers should be helped to adjust to changes on a short-term basis.
On the longer term horizon, adaptation to climate change means rapid evolution of all agricultural and agroecological options, technologies and decision tools.

The IPCC report is a synthesis of current science, not a new piece of primary research.
The work of the IPCC is split three ways: Working Group 1 (WG1) looks at the basic science, Working Group 2 (WG2) look at Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, Working Group 3 (WG3) looks at ways to mitigate (reduce) climate change.
( Who are the scientists in WG2 ?

IPCC to release "Climate Change 2007: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability" report
Geneva, 21 March 2007 – The Working Group II contribution to the "Climate Change 2007" Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) will be presented to the press in Brussels on 6 April 2007.
Additional press briefings focusing on specific impacts at the regional level will follow in various locations around the world starting from 10 April.
The report assesses the latest scientific, environmental and socio-economic literature on "Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability".
It provides a comprehensive analysis of how climate change is affecting natural and human systems, what the impacts will be in the future and how far adaptation and mitigation can reduce these impacts.
The report also contains chapters on specific systems, sectors and regions.
The IPCC will also organize regional press briefings in various locations to provide an in-depth view of the observed and projected climate change impacts in the region, local vulnerabilities and adaptation strategies.
Most of the briefings will take place on 10 April.
The briefings will be given by IPCC scientists from that region whose expertise addresses the key regional issues.
All information about the regional events (locations, venues, speakers, contact persons for accreditation, etc.
) will be published on the IPCC website as soon as they are confirmed.
Journalists are kindly invited to check the IPCC homepage for updates.
This morning in Brussels, Working Group II of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change releases its report on the latest scientific consensus on the currently observable and projected regional impacts of global warming – such as drought, wildfires, alteration of habitat, dislocation and extinction of species, flooding and increased vectors for disease.
The projections are based on business-as-usual conditions if action is not taken to reduce global warming pollution.
The IPCC is the forum for 2,500 of the world’s preeminent climate scientists representing more than 130 nations.
The first working group report released in February made international news with its “unequivocal” conclusion that global warming is occurring and is “very likely” to be caused by the burning of fossil fuels such as oil and coal.
Jeremy Symons, Executive Director of the National Wildlife Federation’s Global Warming Program, is available to comment on the significance of the IPCC findings and the growing momentum for action to cut global warming pollution among the public, business leaders, state and local governments, and in Congress.
Dr. Amanda Staudt provides scientific expertise for the National Wildlife Federation’s activities on global warming.
Prior to joining NWF, Dr. Staudt directed the National Academies of Science Climate Research Committee and helped author more than a dozen reports on topics including the U.S. strategy for supporting climate change research, radiative forcing of climate, past records of surface temperature, and practices for effective global change assessments.

Washington, DC (April 6) “The world’s preeminent scientists are telling us with unmistakable clarity that it’s not just global warming, it’s local warming.
It’s happening where we live.
“The cascade of evidence should overcome any question that we must act now to reduce global warming pollution.
“We can solve this problem by consistently reducing global warming pollution by just 2 percent each year, 20 percent a decade.
America can do this if America sets it mind to it.
“The report’s message is water, water, water – more drought in the West, more flooding in the East and higher sea levels along all our coasts.
“Global warming is as unfair as it is dangerous – it will strike the poor hardest.
One to two billion people will face increased water scarcity with a global average temperature rise of about 3 degrees F from today’s temperatures.
The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) presents a devastating outlook for the world's environment and economy, unless action is taken to stop climate change
In its latest report released in Brussels, the IPCC clearly shows that the impacts of climate change are here, now, and will only get worse.
Sea levels are already rising; 100 million people who live less than one metre above sea level are at risk of losing their homes and their livelihoods.
In India and China people could go hungry as crops fail due to the effects of global warming.
Freshwater supply for hundreds of millions of people is at risk.
But even this summary report only represents the tip of the iceberg.
The effects of climate change are altering the chemistry of the planet, causing the extinctions of species, and undermining economic and social development.
"Delegates wrestled to agree each word because they knew that their Heads of State are anxiously waiting for the conclusions of this important scientific conference," says Hans Verolme, Director of WWF's Global Climate Change Programme.
"The urgency of this report, prepared by the world's top scientists, should be matched with an equally urgent response by governments.
"
"There's no escaping the facts: global warming will bring hunger, floods and water shortages.
Poor countries that bear least responsibility will suffer most - and they have no money to respond - but people should also be aware that even the richer countries risk enormous damage.
Doing nothing is not an option, on the contrary it will have disastrous consequences.
The industrialized countries simply need to accept their responsibilities and start implementing the solutions," adds Verolme.
The IPCC experts state clearly that some climate change is already unavoidable: but there is still time to protect ourselves against some of the most disastrous effects.
This response must come as part of a broad and rapid change of development strategies, looking to avoid significant CO2 emissions.
"The irritating thing is that we have all the tools at hand to limit climate change and save the world from the worst impacts," says Dr Lara Hansen, Chief Scientist of WWF's Global Climate Change Programme.
"The IPCC makes it clear that there is a window of opportunity but that it's closing fast.
The world needs to use its collective brains to think ahead for the next ten years and work together to prevent this crisis.
"
"It becomes an economic as much as an ethical priority to defend what remains of nature on this planet -mangroves and coral reefs protect coasts, forests protect watersheds," adds Hansen.
"Our societies are dependent upon nature, yet we have undermined it for centuries.
Now, with climate change, we are attacking the very basis of the natural world - putting us all at risk.
"
Brussels, Belgium — The new report was agreed after almost a week of negotiations, at the end of a tense 24-hour marathon session which became increasingly political.
The second of a series of four to be released throughout 2007, this report documents the widespread effects that rising temperatures are already having on ecosystems and human activities and assesses the changes projected from human induced climate change over the next century.
"This is a glimpse into an apocalyptic future.
The earth will be transformed by human induced climate change, unless action is taken soon and fast," said Stephanie Tunmore, Greenpeace International Climate and Energy Campaigner.
"What this report shows is that we are simply running out of time.
"
* It is likely that climate change will induce mass extinction of species within 60-70 years.
We have already seen the climate linked extinction of some frog species but this is just the tip of the iceberg.
The scale of risk is larger than most of the five major extinction events that have occurred in the earth's history.
* Reductions in food production capacity in the poorest parts of the world are projected, bringing more hunger and misery and undermining achievement of the millennium development goals.
Within a few decades it is likely that we will see climate change induced wheat, maize and rice production drops in India and China.
* Increased drought and water scarcity are likely to lead to growing problems of hunger and human dislocation in Africa in coming decades.
* The loss of glaciers in Asia, Latin America and Europe are set to cause major water supply problems for a large fraction of the world's population, as well as a massive increase in glacial lake outburst floods and other risks for those living in the glaciated mountains.
* Huge numbers of people will be at risk due to sea level rise, storm surge and river flooding in the Asian Megadeltas such as the Ganges-Brahmaputra (Bangladesh) and the Zhujiang (Pearl River).
* Warming of more than another degree could commit the world to multi-metre sea level rise over several centuries from the partial or total loss of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets.
Huge coastal dislocation would result and could be triggered by emissions made in the next several decades.
In a late night manoeuvre, after nearly 22 hours of negotiations Saudi Arabia, China and Russia gutted a key figure in the IPCC report on impacts, removing a graph of the warming effects of fossil fuel emissions from a key summary table.
The move was described in an emotional statement to the Plenary by a senior climate scientist as an "act of scientific vandalism".
Without the warming graph the table of impacts lacks a context to show when the projected impacts would occur.
Based on observational evidence from all continents and most oceans, there is [very] high confidence that many natural systems, are being affected by regional climate changes, particularly temperature increases.
The main ice covered landmass is Antarctica at the South Pole, with about 90 percent of the world's ice (and 70 percent of its fresh water).
Antarctica is covered with ice an average of 2,133 metres (7,000 feet) thick, and in many places thickness exceeds 4,000 metres (13,123 feet), reaching a maximum of 4,800 metres(15,748 feet).
The British Antarctic Survey estimates the volume of the ice sheet to be 30 million cubic kilometres.
If all this were to melt, sea levels would rise by 57 m (187 feet) and the interior of the continent would also rise.
This rebound would be caused by the huge weight redistribution of ice sheets as they change to water and enter the sea.
The weight of the Antarctic ice is so great that in many areas it actually pushes the land below sea-level and if the ice cover was removed Antarctica would slowly rise up another 450 metres (1500 feet) above sea-level.
The average temperature is -37°C, so the ice this should take an extended period of time to melt.
In fact in most parts of the continent it never gets above freezing.
The whole ice sheet is divided into three main components:
1.
The East Antarctic ice sheet, mainly occupying ground above sea level and which is therefore relatively stable;
2.
The West Antarctic ice sheet, resting on a bed that is mainly below sea-level and which is therefore vulnerable to catastrophic collapse; and
3.
The Antarctic Peninsula ice sheet, a relatively small volume of ice covering the land of the same name that stretches towards South America.
The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2001 emphasised that human induced climate change has the potential to trigger large scale changes in Earth systems, that could have severe consequences at a global scale.
If the rising temperature affects glaciers and icebergs, could the polar ice caps be in danger of melting and causing the oceans to rise?
The U.S. National Research Council issued a report summarised by a group of scientists who state, “it is conceivable that human forcing of climate change is increasing the probability of large, abrupt events.
Were such an event to recur, the economic and ecological impacts could be large and potentially serious”.
In studying icebergs, scientists recognise that the final stages of iceberg break-up imitate the rapid disintegration of ice shelves caused by climate warming.
Floating shelves of ice on the Antarctic Peninsula are experiencing temperatures and melt rates that they can no longer withstand.
Ice shelves are important because they help control glacier flow; removal of ice shelves causes rapid glacier acceleration and calving.
Already we have seen the collapse and break-up of the Wordie and Larsen Ice Shelves.
The collapse of the Larsen Ice Shelf was the largest single disintegration event in 30 years of ice shelf monitoring (yellow section on map below).
Preliminary studies of sediment cores suggest that it may have been this ice shelf's first collapse in 12,000 years.
A huge section from the Ross Ice Shelf (red coloured portion on map below) called the B15 icberg also broke away.
It was the largest single free floating iceberg ever recorded.

At the other end of the world, at the North Pole , the ice is not nearly as thick as at the South Pole.
The ice floats on the Arctic Ocean.
There is a significant amount of ice covering Greenland, which would add another 7 metres (20 feet) to the oceans if it melted.
Because Greenland is closer to the equator than Antarctica, the temperatures there are higher, and the ice is melting relatively quickly.
A marked warming trend is evident in the Antarctic Peninsula, with spectacular loss of ice shelves, and movement of glaciers which must cause a rethink of the stability of the larger West Anatarctic Ice Sheet.
The IPCC issued a report which contained various projections of the sea level change by the year 2100.
They estimate that the sea will rise 50 centimeters (20 inches) with the lowest estimates at 15 centimeters (6 inches) and the highest at 95 centimeters (37 inches).
Sea level rise takes place through two processes; thermal expansion of the ocean and from melting glaciers and ice sheets.
If we are going to be smart and combat greenhouse gases and global warming, we must consider renewable energy as a viable choice to traditional fossil fuel sources.
Climate change is a global challenge and countries need to work together to develop and install both renewable energy and low emission technologies.
Recycle Everything in your house, newspapers, cans, glass bottles and jars, aluminium foil, motor oil, scrap metal, to name a few.
Re-use brown paper bags to line your trash can instead of plastic bags.
Re-use bread bags and the bags you bring home from shopping.
be smart and store food in re-usable containers, instead of plastic wrap or aluminium foil.
By fixing any broken seals to fridges or freezers the appliance does not have to work so hard to keep its contents cool and will reduce energy usage.
It should also help in keeping the food preserved for longer.
The appliance is also likely to last longer because it does not have to work so hard.
You don't have to give up your gadgets to slow climate change.
You can use solar power to charge your cell phone, iPod, radio, just about everything, under the sun.
Check out some eco-gadgets here.
Another way to stop global warming is to plant more trees.
Forests and trees breathe in carbon dioxide and by planting trees we create a sink, (C02 is sunk in the trees).
The carbon dioxide is then tied up and kept out of the atmosphere.
The massive deforestation and excessive logging in the past century has wiped out much of our natural forests and rainforests and has removed these precious carbon sinks, stopping the natural uptake of this carbon dioxide.
By planting more trees we can create forests that breathe in the carbon dioxide and in turn breathe out our life giving oxygen.
A smart thin to do would be to volunteer with tree planting groups and get involved for a few hours each year to reinvigorate yourself and our atmosphere.
If you are unable to get out and plant, or spare the time, then purchase trees to be planted on your behalf.
There are plenty of organizations that you can pay to plant a tree on your behalf.
Trees also make wonderful birthday gifts, organise your gifts through Sustainable Harvest , or Rainforest Rescue .
Human actions are fundamentally, and to a significant extent irreversibly, changing the diversity of life on Earth, and most of these changes represent a loss of biodiversity.
Changes in important components of biological diversity were more rapid in the past 50 years than at any time in human history.
Projections and scenarios indicate that these rates will continue, or accelerate, in the future.
Virtually all of Earth’s ecosystems have now been dramatically transformed through human actions.
Over the past few hundred years, humans have increased species extinction rates by as much as 1,000 times background rates that were typical over Earth’s history (See below).
Biodiversity contributes directly (through provisioning, regulating, and cultural ecosystem services)and indirectly (through supporting ecosystem services) to many constituents of human well-being, including security, basic material for a good life, health, good social relations, and freedom of choice and action.
Many people have benefited over the last century from the conversion of natural ecosystems to human-dominated ecosystems and the exploitation of biodiversity.
At the same time, however, these losses in biodiversity and changes in ecosystem services have caused some people to experience declining well-being, with poverty in some social groups being exacerbated.
1.
Climate, biodiversity and human wellbeing are inextricably linked.
Significant political commitments and policy objectives for each now exist at national and international levels.
Our understanding of these issues, the relevant processes and their inter-relationships is far from complete.
But we know enough to identify some critically important matters for immediate attention and priority areas for research and policy development.
New mechanisms will be needed to galvanise work in this area, especially at the intergovernmental level.
2.
Significant climate change impacts on biodiversity have already been identified with up to 50% of the species studied world-wide observed to be affected.
The Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2007b) concludes that if temperature increases exceed 1.5-2.5°C, 20-30% of plant and animal species assessed are likely to be at risk of extinction.
3.
The continuing, accelerating loss of biodiversity could compromise the long-term ability of ecosystems to regulate the climate, may accelerate or amplify climate warming and could lead to additional, unforeseen, and potentially irreversible shifts in the earth system.
Urgent action now to halt further loss or degradation of biodiversity could help to maintain future options for tackling climate change and managing its impacts.
4.
Both mitigation and adaptation are urgently required if we are to reduce climate change and its impacts over coming decades.
Many of the people most vulnerable to climate change are those who depend most on biodiversity.
Climate change policy must maximise the opportunities for implementation of mutually supportive strategies.
5.
New policies are needed to integrate options for meeting biodiversity, climate and sustainable development objectives at the international, national, and local levels.
Difficult policy choices lie ahead, requiring scientific and technical expertise and understanding of socio-economic and ethical considerations.
For example, climate change policies must, as a priority, identify the protection of biodiversity and healthy ecosystems as highly relevant to climate change mitigation and adaptation.
6.
Our understanding of the impact of climate on biodiversity is increasing, but our knowledge of the impact of biodiversity on climate is less advanced.
A significant new research effort is required to improve understanding of the role of biodiversity in earth and climate systems, the impacts of climate change on biodiversity and human populations, and their interlinkages, feedback mechanisms and cross-scale effects.
1.1 The interconnectedness of climate, biodiversity and human wellbeing
Biodiversity is important in ecosystems and for the provision of ecosystem services including climate regulation.
It can therefore play an important role in reducing climate change and its impacts, and protecting and improving societal wellbeing.
However, there is growing concern that efforts to address climate change may have the unintended consequence of exacerbating biodiversity loss, and so reduce future options for responding to climate change.
Climate, biodiversity and human wellbeing are inextricably linked (Figure 1).
Over the past few hundred years, human activity has significantly changed the face of the planet, a period sometimes described as the anthropocene (Crutzen & Stoermer 2000).
As a consequence we are changing the earth’s climate, species are disappearing at a faster rate than ever before, and many of the ecosystems on which humans and other species depend for their basic survival are being degraded or used unsustainably.
Over the last 50 years humans have changed ecosystems more rapidly and extensively than in any comparable period of time in human history (MA 2005a).
The implications of these changes are only now beginning to be understood.
Anthropogenic climate change provides a compelling example of the profound effect human activities can have on natural systems and of the consequences of these impacts for human wellbeing.
Even if greenhouse gas emissions were to cease immediately, temperatures would continue to rise for at least 30 years, and sea levels for the next 100 years.
Action must be taken now to prepare for the impacts that are inevitable over forthcoming decades.
Efforts must be targeted to reducing the vulnerability of those human populations and ecosystems most at risk.
Because ecosystems collectively determine the biogeochemical and biophysical processes that regulate the earth system, the potential ecological and climate consequences of biodiversity loss are arousing significant scientific interest.
Continued biodiversity loss may compromise the longterm ability of ecosystems to regulate the climate, may accelerate or amplify climate warming, and could lead to additional, unforeseen, and potentially irreversible shifts in the earth system.
Biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation should be of major concern to decision-makers around the world.
However, recognition of the critical nature of this problem, and of the potential opportunities of biodiversity management for meeting climate change policy objectives, has been slow to appear outside of the biodiversity community.
The interdependencies of biodiversity, ecosystems, human livelihoods and the climate system make it possible to address biodiversity loss, ecosystem degradation, sustainable development, and climate change and its impacts, together.
However, there is also growing awareness that win-win-wins will not always be possible, and trade-offs may be necessary.
To realise the potential co-benefits, and to ensure trade-offs are as equitable and ecologically sustainable as possible, new decision-making and implementation frameworks are required.
The international community has a critical role to play in this, and in supporting the capacity building and resources required for implementation.
National governments and local communities also have their part to play.
The messages are simple; climate change is unequivocal.
Both mitigation and adaptation will be required to address the risks posed by climate change.
Biodiversity and human wellbeing are inextricably linked and climate regulation must be central to the development of adaptation and mitigation programmes.
Biological diversity (biodiversity) is defined by the Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD) as the variability among living organisms from all sources, including terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems, and the ecological complexes of which they are part.
This includes diversity within species, between species, and of ecosystems.
The role and function of biodiversity in ecosystems is complex but we know those ecosystem properties, and therefore the services they provide, are influenced by the characteristics of the species present and their functional traits (Reich et al 2004, Hooper et al 2005).
Crucially, higher genetic and species diversity tends to make ecosystems more resistant and resilient to disturbance.
This is because species are more likely to be present with characteristics that will enable the ecosystem to adjust to environmental change (Hooper et al 2005, Reusch et al 2005, Tilman et al 2006).
This means that ecosystems can continue to function and provide critical services such as water purification.
As biodiversity declines, so too does the resilience of the system (Amazon ecosystem).
Ecosystems with low resilience, when subject to shocks or disturbance, may reach a threshold at which abrupt change occurs (Scheffer et al 2001).
Biodiversity is therefore important as it provides flexibility and insurance, and spreads risk across temporal and spatial scales (Yachi and Loreau 1999, Loreau, Mouquet and Gonzalez 2003).
The components of human wellbeing were defined by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005) as security, basic material for a good life, health, good social relations, and freedom of choice and action, all of which depend either directly or indirectly on ecosystems and the services they provide (and therefore on biodiversity).
Humans rely on food, clean air and water, timber and medicines for survival.
Human livelihoods rely on ecological services that support global employment and economic activity (for example food and timber production, marine fisheries and aquaculture, and recreation) (MA 2005a).
The relationship between biodiversity and human wellbeing was characterised by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) (2005a), which described four categories of services provided by ecosystems to society (see Figure 2).
Supporting services underpin all other ecosystem services and capture processes such as carbon cycling (eg primary production, decomposition, and soil formation), and water and nutrient (eg nitrogen and phosphorus) cycling.
Regulating services provide the mechanisms that moderate the impact of stresses and shocks on ecosystems (Kinzig et al 2006) and include, for example, climate and disease regulation.
Regulating services determine the distribution of provisioning services, such as food, fuel and fibre, and cultural services such as spiritual and aesthetic values (Kinzig et al 2007).
The transformation of ecosystems and exploitation of natural resources have resulted in substantial gains in human wellbeing and economic development.
However, the benefits have not been equitably distributed, and the costs of biodiversity changes either not recognised or quantified.
This is because ecosystems tend to be valued by people in terms of the direct benefits provided by provisioning and cultural services (eg food, fibre, recreation and aesthetics respectively) which represent a relatively small component of biodiversity.
However, the supply of these services is underpinned by supporting and regulating services, (for example pollination, climate regulation and primary productivity respectively), for which the value of biodiversity is less visible but no less important (Scholes & Midgley 2007, Kinzig et al 2007).
Biodiversity loss, ecosystem degradation, and consequent changes in ecosystem services have also led to a decline in human wellbeing in some groups by exacerbating poverty and increasing inequities and disparities (MA 2005b).
Millennium Ecosystem Assessment typology of the relationships between Biodiversity, Ecosystem functioning, and Ecosystem services.
Biodiversity is both a response variable affected by global change drivers, and a factor modifying ecosystem processes and services and human well-being (MA 2005b).
The material for biodiversity and human wellbeing was sourced from:
The Royal Society, (June 2007) Biodiversity-climate interactions: adaptation, mitigation and human livelihoods, www.royalsoc.org.
The term "biomass" means any material that has been alive (organic matter) available on a renewable basis, including dedicated energy crops and trees, agricultural food and feed crops, agricultural crop wastes and residues, wood wastes and residues, aquatic plants, municipal wastes, (landfill gas) and other waste materials.
It excludes organic material which has been transformed by geological processes into substances such as coal or petroleum.
Though this resource is a renewable fuel, it can still contribute to global warming.
This happens when the natural carbon equilibrium is disturbed; for example by deforestation or urbanisation of green sites.
Use of this organic energy includes ethanol, biodiesel, power, and industrial process energy.
Joachim von Braun, lead author of the "World Food Situation" report and director general of the institute also said, "Surging demand for food, feed and fuel have recently led to drastic price increases ... climate change will also have a negative impact on food production,".
Agricultural residues are generated after each harvesting cycle of commodity crops.
A portion of the remaining stalks and material left on the ground can be collected and used for energy generation purposes.
Wheat straw and corn stover make up the majority of crop residues in the United States.
Forestry residues are the materials remaining in forests that have been harvested for timber.
Timber harvesting operations do not extract all forest material, because only timber of certain quality is usable in processing facilities.
Therefore, the residual material after a timber harvest is potentially available for energy generation purposes.
Forestry residues are composed of logging residues, rough rotten salvageable dead wood, and excess small pole trees.
The key here is 'residue', under no account could forest products be taken to generate power or this would defeat the whole purpose.
Urban wood waste/mill residues are waste woods from manufacturing operations that would otherwise be landfilled.
The urban wood waste/mill residue category includes primary mill residues and urban wood such as pallets, construction waste, and demolition debris, which are not otherwise used.
In fact, Gore used the word “insane” or “insanity” at least 3 times (we’ll check the records to see if there more) in his descriptions of various political and business decisions made (or not made) with regard to climate.
“Since we met here last year (at CGI) we are losing badly in the fight against global warming”
11:28 References all the natural disasters – from hurricanes to fires in the US and Carribbean this year.
Warming means less or no more frost in certain areas, which means more bugs/pests running rampant that we can’t control; throwing off our ecosystem.
(haven’t heard him use this point before.
“This is all the result of an insane approach to climate”
Gore: Stock traders that inform investors that global warming doesn’t prevent a threat are guilty of a form of stock fraud.
Not that we needed their advice to do so.
Grassroots efforts wouldn’t have stopped 59 plants in 2007 if people hadn’t already been working with many tools across all social and age boundaries to fight for climate justice.
Before we rise-up and sit-in, wouldn’t it be prudent to approach this issue without rhetoric and apples-to-oranges comparisons?
I am an advocate for engagement and passionate response, but only through reasoned analysis and measured steps can we effect a practicable, appropriate solution to real issues.
With respect to global warming, I submit that one avenue to pursue for those of you already engaged is to review some of the wealth of dispassionate analyses of climate research already at your fingertips, and available at climateaudit.org.
I suggest a few minutes reading this particular post: http://www.climateaudit.org/index.php?p=166 .

As an aside, someone bought me a book he wrote on environmental protection but due to his cape wind stance i have never read it...can someone truly be passionate about the environment and be that resistent to an offshore wind farm?
Still, the transcript might be usefull in deciding how to frame your arguments.

“The need to reduce our carbon emissions to avoid serious climate change is one of the greatest challenges humans have had to confront – is a complex issue that will only be solved by us all working together – scientists, politicians and society.
Right now, Antarctic scientists and our colleagues in the Arctic are taking part in International Polar Year - the biggest ever globally co-ordinated research effort – to help find the way forward.
Hopefully, Live Earth will make a real difference in public awareness and attract talented young people to become scientists – it’s a cool job with a real purpose.
I am looking forward to Nunatak’s appearance in the Live Earth concert inspiring young people the world over.”

New York City (June 28, 2007) – Live Earth Founder Kevin Wall joined with former U.S. Vice President Al Gore and Alliance for Climate Protection CEO Cathy Zoi today to announce the Live Earth Call to Action – a series of commitments that Live Earth will be asking people across the globe to make to combat the climate crisis.
Wall also announced that there are going to be more than 6,000 satellite Live Earth events taking place in more than 100 nations around the world on July 7th in support of Live Earth.
In addition to providing over 100 simple actions people can take in their daily lives, which will have a tremendous positive impact when carried out on a mass scale, Live Earth will ask people to support a 90% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050 and a comprehensive international treaty on global warming by 2009.
“If we are going to solve this crisis, we have to commit, and we have to do it now.
Live Earth will ask people across the world to commit to changes in their lives and to move other people, communities, companies and governments to reduce our carbon output by 90% by 2050 and ensure there’s a new, global treaty on climate change by 2009,” Gore said.
“Nations all over the world are making progress in tackling the climate crisis.
But too many proposals fall short of the strong, decisive action that’s needed.
Individual nations alone cannot solve this crisis.
The nations of the world must join together as one if we are to succeed.”
Live Earth will ask people to commit to making changes at home, at work, while getting around, while shopping, in their communities and to urge changes by their governments.
Through its “Answer the Call” campaign, people can make their commitments and find solutions against the climate crisis at liveearth.org, LiveEarth.MSN.com, or by sending a free text message of “SOS” to 82004.
At Thursday’s announcement in New York City, Gore, Wall and Zoi all signed Live Earth’s 7-point pledge on the climate crisis:
To demand that my country join an international treaty within the next 2 years that cuts global warming pollution by 90% in developed countries and by more than half worldwide in time for the next generation to inherit a healthy earth;
To take personal action to help solve the climate crisis by reducing my own CO2 pollution as much as I can and offsetting the rest to become “carbon neutral;”
To buy from businesses and support leaders who share my commitment to solving the climate crisis and building a sustainable, just, and prosperous world for the 21st century.
“Live Earth will jump-start an ongoing, global effort that will drive a critical mass of people to stand up and make challenging global warming a priority in their lives.
Live Earth will be a launch event that no movement has ever seen before.
Our message will reach all 7 continents with 8 official concerts, special broadcast events broadcast worldwide on TV, radio and the Internet.
We’ve produced a collection of films, PSAs, and even an official Live Earth companion book.
This massive multimedia platform will be the foundation for a movement that drives us to the tipping point,”
“If enough people come together to fight against the climate crisis, corporations and governments will have no choice but to act as well.”
“The climate crisis requires a global solution.
Live Earth is using an unprecedented media architecture to reach a global audience,”
In addition, Wall noted that Live Earth has produced more than 60 short films, 30 PSAs featuring stars like Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz, and a book – The Live Earth Global Warming Survival Handbook by David de Rothschild that was released just this week – to serve as lasting media that will echo the Live Earth call to action delivered at the concerts on July 7.
The Alliance for Climate Protection, Al Gore.com, Avaaz, Defenders of Wildlife, ICLEI and the Sierra Club have joined with Live Earth to organize Friends of Live Earth events around the world.
Evite is also encouraging its users to hold Live Earth viewing parties.
“Live Earth is just the beginning of a massive global movement.
It will be the first great note in a worldwide song demanding change that will be heard on every continent in every time zone.
And we will keep singing this song until meaningful actions are taken by our leaders to halt the climate crisis,” Zoi said.
“Post Live Earth, The Alliance for Climate Protection is undertaking a 3-5 year campaign to educate people from all walks of life that the climate crisis is both critically urgent and something we can solve.
We will take the momentum of Live Earth and continue to challenge people to take action in their own lives and demand action from their leaders — actions that must deliver reductions in global warming pollution that will safeguard the planet and provide for a prosperous 21st century.”
Also, the money raised from the events will go towards the Alliance for Climate Protection , an organization with a long term vision.
Also, the live earth website and a supporting book are being published in order to give people effective tips on what they can do to reduce there emissions.
Live earth is also working closely with Avaaz , an online action community, to promote personal and political engagement with climate change.
Climate change explained for kids...the climate jam, groovy!

In the UK we have high awareness of Climate Change, this is also the case in parts of the US, but globally this is far from the case, therefore raising awareness is vital.
5.
Yes there will be private jets, yes we are living in a society that has developed in a carbon intensive manner but we need to force the government to enact policies to encourage low carbon and more efficient technologies, and enable social change...all of this is what the event is about we aren't going to ban concerts of any type because of climate change, come on get real.
For it's 50th year of programming the BBC's internationally renowned Natural History Unit are producing 'Saving Planet Earth'.
Dealing both with the plight of individual species around the globe and discussing the threat of climate change this series will be broadcast at 7pm on BBC One for 10 consecutive evenings in the run up to Live Earth!
Attenborough, the UK's most trusted celebrity has only recently spoken of his increasing concern about climate change.
This series, along with Live Earth, looks set to again turn up the heat on UK politicians to stop the rhetoric and start the action on climate change.
The BBC have for some time been very good about explaining climate change, including a very good micro-site ; its good to see them stepping up there game.
The section where people can pledge to reduce there environmental impact is also very welcome, i perticularly like the 'Dosen't everybody Do that' option for reducing fuel consumption...normalising these behaviours is key to wider acceptence.
In the Philippines El Nino Means Drought and Huge Carbon Release
According to Columbia University's International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI) El Nino cycles are associated with drought in the Philippines.
"Droughts are not generally associated with the Philippines, a country known for its steamy tropical marine climate.
But during El Niño cycles, much of the country experiences moderate-to-severe dry periods that can last for a season or more.
"
"[In] Manila, home to more than 10 million people, it is drought — not typhoons — that has led to rising tensions between urban dwellers and farmers who work just outside the city.
"
Whilst the verdict is still open on how the El Nino effect will be altered by climate change, the prevailing view seems to be that the base state of the atmosphere--the normal mode--will become more El Nino like.
According to RealClimate there is still much uncertainty as to how this will effect the events themselves, will the fluctuations remain the same (which would lead to more extreme floods and droughts if the atmosphere is already El Nino like) or will the events be tempered (leading to similar levels of extreme events)?
One very recent paper in the journal Nature suggests that extreme droughts and floods will indeed become more prevalent.
According to RedBolivia :
Study co-author Nerilie Abram says the new data suggest an unexpected link between monsoons and droughts in countries surrounding the Indian Ocean.
This year's drought in Indonesia is caused partly by a natural cycle of cooling in the Indian Ocean much like the El Nino phenomenon in the Pacific Ocean.
Despite this latest piece of science leading us to suspect a link between climate change and ever stronger droughts in Indonesia the media are by and large continuing there miserable failure to connect the dots.
The International Herald Tribune writes that inflation is up in Indonesia but completely fails to mention any possible link between climate change and this economic effect!
Another issue where there is no definitive evidence of a climatic cause but where this link is extremely likely and where key drivers are certainly environmental rather than political is the situation in Dar fur, but this is miraculously under reported.
Drought in Indonesia is, however, not simply worrying for the farmers and the nations economy but for the global community.
Thanks to rampant deforestation of old growth rain forest and the expansion of agriculture--particularly palm oil plantations into the heart of Indonesia--the number of forest fires has increased dramatically.
These fires are not, however limited to the dessicated fringes of rain forest but in many cases have led to the burning of the peat substrate on which the rain forests and newly planted crops reside.
Palm oil production in particular is having disastrous effects on the global carbon cycle, high carbon bogs have to be drained in order to create palm oil plantations.
Greenhouse gas emissions from this process across Indonesia have insured that in times of extreme drought due to strong El Nino Indonesia has--according to many estimates--supplanted the US for a time as the worlds largest contributor to climate change.
Palm oil is, ironically, being used more and more as a source of that green fuel Biodiesil!

"Any unforeseen flood or crisis can make prices rise very quickly.
I do not think we should panic but we should be very careful about what may happen," he warned.
The food crisis is being compounded by growing populations, extreme weather and ecological stress, according to a number of recent reports.
This week the UN Environment Programme said the planet's water, land, air, plants, animals and fish stocks were all in "inexorable decline".
According to the UN's World Food Programme (WFP) 57 countries, including 29 in Africa, 19 in Asia and nine in Latin America, have been hit by catastrophic floods.
Harvests have been affected by drought and heatwaves in south Asia, Europe, China, Sudan, Mozambique and Uruguay.
This week the Australian government said drought had slashed predictions of winter harvests by nearly 40%, or 4m tonnes.
"It is likely to be even smaller than the disastrous drought-ravaged 2006-07 harvest and the worst in more than a decade," said the Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics.
But fears for even tighter conditions revolve around deepening climate change, which generates worsening floods and droughts, diminishing food supplies.
If the price of oil rises further it will make fertilisers and transport more expensive, and at the same time make it more profitable to grow biofuel crops.
Supply will be further restricted if fish stocks continue to decline due to overfishing, and if soils become exhausted and erosion decreases the arable area.
Climate change isn't just a crisis.
It's a business opportunity--at least in the view of insurance industry leaders, who are mapping out a strategy that could force the rest of the economy to grapple with global warming as never before.
American International Group, the world's largest insurer, announced two weeks ago that it was "actively seeking to incorporate environmental and climate change considerations across its businesses.
" It is developing new products to respond to the global drive to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Last month, the No.
1 insurance broker, Marsh & McLennan, distributed a white paper to a roster of Fortune 500 clients, suggesting that corporations ranging from soft-drink companies to banks may need to respond to global warming or be left out in the cold.
These are the first such moves by U.S. insurers, but in Europe, giant reinsurers like Swiss Re have long been active in the Kyoto Protocol, under which 36 nations have been participating in a market-based system to cut carbon dioxide.
The phenomenal growth of that fledgling market, coinciding with last year's record claims due to the violent Gulf Coast hurricanes, has focused insurers on the money that could be made--or lost--on climate change.
That's a welcome development for environmentalists.
"They are a high-leverage, high-impact industry," says Mindy Lubber, president of the shareholder activist group Ceres.
Ceres coordinates the Investor Network on Climate Risk, institutional investors who manage $3 trillion in assets and have been pushing for insurers to become advocates on the issue, much as they pushed successfully in the past for fire codes or auto safety regulations.
Many attribute insurers' new climate awareness to the record $55.3 billion in natural disaster losses they sustained in 2005, double the previous high point set just the year before, with Hurricane Katrina leading the pack.
Retreating.
Insurers certainly are pushing through massive rate increases on the southeastern coast of the United States, retreating from some areas altogether, but the companies maintain that these are standard underwriting decisions, separate from their climate change activities.
"We don't make the leap where we are saying that we endorse the idea that hurricanes are a direct result of global warming or that global warming is a direct result of human activities," says Chris Winans, an AIG vice president.
"But we take the possibility seriously.
"
The climate strategies the insurers have spelled out aren't about avoiding losses; they're about generating revenue.
For example, AIG aims to get in on Europe's carbon-trading scheme, a market valued at $10 billion last year and, although climbing out of a precipitous fall a few weeks ago, one that is expected to surpass $25 billion in 2006.
Even though the United States has not signed on to Kyoto and does not participate, AIG says it will invest in projects around the globe aimed at generating credits to trade on this market.
(Buyers would be factories or power companies that are struggling to meet their emissions limits under the treaty.

The Fraser Institute, a right-wing think tank that has recently received annual grants from oil-giant ExxonMobil, promised an independent summary of the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
The Institute claimed that the IPCC’s own summary is a political document “neither written by nor reviewed by the scientific community,” while the Fraser Institute version was “prepared by qualified experts in fields related to climate science.”
In fact, the IPCC summary was written and reviewed by some of the most senior climate scientists in the world, without political or bureaucratic input .
And the Fraser Institute’s “scientific” staff – which is led by an economist – includes a group of junior or retired scientists, most of whom have direct connections to energy industry lobby groups (see attached briefing note).
Dr. Andrew Weaver , the Canada Research Chair in Climate Modelling and Analysis and a lead IPCC author, called the Independent Summary “highly ideological.” While the Fraser Institute summary says, "There is no compelling evidence that dangerous or unprecedented changes are underway," Weaver counters: “The IPCC report presents 1,600 pages of compelling evidence, that’s the whole point.”
Weaver also criticized the Fraser Institute’s contention that climate change may not be happening or that if it is happening, it may be “a good or bad thing.”
In the face of all the scientfic evidence it is amazing that these guys are actually arguing that global warming is good for us???
Maybe good for Exxon and the fraser institute.
They are corporate dinosaurs that are quicly going extinct!
If this is the level of credibility brought to us by the Fraser Institute on climate change, we must call into question their "advice" on other matters as well.
This stance on climate change is nothing less than subversive of the democratic process which depends so profoundly upon truth.
As self ordained defenders of freedom they must be ashamed
Its always hard to convey sarcasm with written word!
Down with the Fraser institute!
No room for tobacco deniers in the global warming discussion!
Has fi responded?
that the propaganda machine (incl desmogblog) has to start even before the IPCC political climate fear report has been released.
Is the report that weak on substance?
of desmogblog here is based on their criticism of the Fraser report.
I am merely an opinionated arm-chair climate expert and I don't claim to know the "truth".
I also don't believe that I am always right.
I leave those claims and beliefs to desmogblog.
Further, desmogblog's claims to "clear the PR pollution" but, instead, they produce ad hominem attacks, with absolutely no substance (at least in the Fraser report case).
Now that is truly pathetic.
If the IPCC is political dogma, than how do you explain the US government's involvement and support (through NOAA)in the IPCC process....Here is a direct quote from Vice Adm. Conrad C. Lautenbacher, Jr., U.S. Navy (Ret.
), undersecretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere and NOAA administrator.
"The depth of NOAA's contributions in this international effort, from a leadership role, providing observations, data, model simulations, analysis, authors and review editors, highlight the preeminent science conducted by our agency.
The efforts contribute to NOAA's goal to understand climate change and variability to enhance society's ability to plan and respond.
"(http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2007/s2787.htm)...So much for environmental policy conspiracy theories.
Since my comments on this "alternative summary" at climateaudit were censored, I shall repost them here.
Much of the text in the summary is uncontentious, but mixed in with details that are deliberately misleading.
For example, in section 2.5d, it discusses Arctic Sea ice thickness, which has not declined recently, rather than ice area which has, and curiously manages to conclude that ice mass has not declined.
mass=area X thickness X density : perhaps the density has changed!
It also includes some of the old favourites, like the absence of any upward temperature trend since 1998 [section 2.1a].
Surprisingly (or not) the summary fails to mention that while 1998 was a big El Nino year, and so warmer global temperatures are expected, 2005 was not an El Nino year but was about as warm.
The expectation, which section 2.1a implicitly makes, that under global warming each year should set a new record is entirely spurious.
This is entirely trivial and obvious, and this argument can only be designed to mislead the gullible.
And in case you didn't see the programme with Nye and Lindzen, it was Lindzen that offered the bet, a bet that he had better honour since he was so obviously wrong in his statement that the ice-core data had less than a 2000 year resolution.
I'm sure he knew better but was of the opinion that he could fool the audience and Larry King.
Democracy is utterly dependent upon an electorate that is accurately informed.
In promoting climate change denial (and often denying their responsibility for doing so) industry has done more than endanger the environment.
It has undermined democracy.
Lately, these fringe players have turned their efforts to creating confusion about climate change.
This PR campaign could not be accomplished without the compliance of media as well as the assent and participation of leaders in government and business.
Help us clear the PR pollution that clouds climate science.
Thanks to our dedicated readers, the DeSmog project counters the seeds of climate confusion.

The Desmog project is our answer to industry PR spin.
In a recent blog post , Calvin at Climate Change Action notes: "Other countries are acting aggressively to reduce man-made contributions to warming...It's time Congress and Bush likewise listened to the chorus.
"
While I appreciate and essentially agree with the sentiments expressed in the article, I think it nicely illustrates a tired and ineffective approach to fomenting change.
Mitigating climate change is much more about rebuilding vibrant communities than passing more legislation.
Thus our public institutions no longer represent the interests of the public at large.
Still, since 2003 many state governments have decided to take the initiative and tackle the issue of climate change themselves.
In June of 2003 Maine became the first state to pass legislation to reduce CO2 emissions.
What followed was the passing of legislation and the creation of regional climate change alliances in several US states and Canadian provinces It's not enough, but it's a start.
To effectively fight climate change, we must be honest with ourselves about what has lead us down this path in the first place.
By virtue of our lifestyles and our civic apathy, we have inadvertently delegated too much control to the global corporatocracy.
Now, as global citizens we must resist empire.
We must reclaim ownership of our technology, our landscapes, and ultimately, our communities.
We must demonstrate ourselves to be effective stewards of our environment.
Yes, federal legislation will help mitigate the effects of global climate change.
But it won't stop it.
So we can focus our energies on rhetorical tirades against the Bush administration, and point our fingers at the villains that we ourselves created while the polar ice caps melt and the world spins into one long mega-disaster, or we can energize our minds and bodies into action by helping our communities find ways to be healthy and sustainable.

The climate camp to be held in northern England at the end of August 2006 - see www.climatecamp.org.uk
Actions against Drax Power Station started early on Thursday morning (31st of August) and continued all day, with the Drax perimeter being breached several times.
Up to 600 campaigners against climate change participated in the Reclaim Power mass action.
Four main blocs gathered at the centre of the Climate Camp before splitting off into different groups, with some heading towards Drax across fields to avoid police road blocks [ Early report | Photos 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | Videos 1 | 2 | Protestors Audio Interview ]
In the early hours of Friday 1st of September the actions around Drax continued.
Reports came in of people attempting to breach the perimeter of the fence overnight.
On the other hand, the Legal Team informed that all of the 38 people arested in yesterday's mass action were released throughout the day, some of which having spent about 28 hours in police custody.
There was also one confirmed arrest that took place on Friday morning.
Two more arrests took place on Saturday 2nd September near the field were the Climate Camp was taking place.
For full details, see the full timeline of events and individual reports that have been posted to IMC-UK Climate Camp page .
The Camp for Climate Action has been hailed as a success, with an impressive collective commitment to organising the camp in an environmentally-friendly way, and with hundreds of people just over half way through a packed programme of workshops .
One statement said:
Meanwhile throughout the day the police have been using Section 60 powers to stop and search all people entering or leaving the Climate Camp [report and pictures 1 | 2 ] Undeterred, people continue coming and going, some taking tours around the increasingly guarded perimeter of Drax power station [ pics ].
Later in the afternoon at around 2.30pm the police were denied entry to the camp [ report and pictures ] in a peaceful but strong reaction by camp residents, with similar scenes repeated again at around 5.30pm [ report ].
From 8am a group of nine climate change campaigners blockaded the front and back gates of Hartlepool Nuclear Power Station, sending out the message that nuclear power is not the solution to climate change.
The blockade was in place for ten hours until the last person was cut out of the arm tubes they had locked themselves into to form the blockade.
Police arrested a total of twenty people including non-blockading supporters and a freelance journalist.
A Bicycology cycle caravan left en masse from the Climate Camp to establish a presence in nearby Selby town centre, holding bicycle maintenance workshops and promoting sustainable energy [ Report and Pics | video ].
In the shadow of Drax power station , hundreds of activists have gathered at the Camp for Climate Action [see report and location | first pictures and call out | video ].
The camp, which started officially on Saturday, August 26th, is based on squatted land and will have over 160 workshops over the course of the week.
For more information and background, see the climate camp special reports section .
Click the Full Article link for updates.
Bicycology is a biketour which will be travelling from London to Lancaster (via Nottingham) this August.
Form Lancaster it will be heading to the Climate Action Camp.
It will visit Nottingham on Saturday 19th August.
On their tour, the Bicycologists will be giving free bike maintainence workshops, holding Dr Bike sessions - come and get your bike fine-tuned - organising bike games and playing around with some crazy tall wobbly bikes; there will also be information and examples of alternative forms of energy, including some pedal-powered gadgets.
This summer, the Camp for Climate Action will be held in ‘Megawatt Valley’ near Leeds, one of the most industrialised areas of the UK and home to the Drax , Eggborough and Ferrybridge coal-fired power stations.
From 26th August - 4th September, the camp promises education about climate change and sustainable living, with around 150 workshops scheduled, ranging from practical building and permaculture activities to the advanced science behind climate change.
Workshops include analysis of the problems and causes of climate change and strategies on how to confront it - both practically on a grassroots level and politically.
Those holding the workshops range from grassroots community activists to internationally-known academics, and from MPs to representatives of environmental NGOs.
During the time of the camp there will also be a Reclaim Power mass direct action against Drax power station (the UK's largest single emitter of CO2 emissions) on August 31st, as well as opportunitites to discuss resistance to nuclear power , the aviation industry , mining and road building schemes and corporate sponsored damage to the environment.
The camp will be held on a legally occupied site, and aims to demonstrate practical solutions in action.
Power usage will be minimised and the site will be powered by alternative energy sources .
Recently on 18th July climate change activists occupied a lighting tower at Didcot power station in Oxfordshire.
Three climbers scaled the tower and unfurled a 50-foot orange and black banner with the words 'Climate Crime' [see pics ].
Just prior to that, July 15th was an 'International Day of Direct Action for Climate Justice, against Climate Change and the G8' [see action roundups 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 ] which coincided with the G8 Summit in Russia .
In London, Tulchan Communications, a public relations firm that works for Drax power station, was forced to deny it had been sacked by Drax for failing to make it look good, after a spoof press release was circulated [ report ].

The devastating impact of global warming is already evident in Indonesia and will likely worsen due to further human-induced climate change, warns WWF.
The review from the global conservation organization, Climate Change in Indonesia – Implications for Humans and Nature, highlights that annual rainfall in the world’s fourth most populous nation is already down by 2 to 3 per cent, and the seasons are changing.
The combination of high population density and high levels of biodiversity, together with a staggering 80,000 kilometres of coastline and 17,500 islands, makes Indonesia one of the most vulnerable countries to the impacts of climate change.
Shifting weather patterns have made it increasingly difficult for Indonesian farmers to decide when to plant their crops, and erratic droughts and rainfall has led to crop failures.
A recent study by a local research institute said that Indonesia had lost 300,000 tonnes of crop production every year between 1992-2000, three times the annual loss in the previous decade.
Climate change in Indonesia means millions of fishermen are also facing harsher weather conditions, while dwindling fish stocks affect their income.
Indonesia's 40 million poor, including farmers and fishermen, will be the worst affected due to threats including rising sea levels, prolonged droughts and tropical cyclones, the report said.
“As rainfall decreases during critical times of the year this translates into higher drought risk, consequently a decrease in crop yields, economic instability and drastically more undernourished people,” says Fitrian Ardiansyah, Director of WWF-Indonesia’s Climate and Energy Programme.
“This will undo Indonesia’s progress against poverty and food insecurity.”
WWF’s review shows that increased rainfall during already wet times of the year may lead to high flood risk, such as the Jakarta flood of February this year that killed more than 65 people and displaced nearly half a million people, with economic losses of US$450 million.
Climate change impacts are noticeable throughout the Asia-Pacific region.
More frequent and severe heat waves, floods, extreme weather events and prolonged droughts will continue to lead to increased injury, illness and death.
Continued warming temperatures will also increase the number of malaria and dengue fever cases and lead to an increase in other infectious diseases as a result of poor nutrition due to food production disruption.
“The Indonesian government must take its role seriously and lead the way in the fight against global climate change,” says Mubariq Ahmed, Executive Director and CEO of WWF-Indonesia.
“Indonesia has to take up the challenge of climate change, putting climate adaption into the development agenda, promoting sustainable land use, as well as demanding support from industrialized nations.”
Indonesia is already a significant emitter of greenhouse gases due to deforestation and land-use change, estimated at 2 million hectares per year and accounts for 85 per cent of the country’s annual greenhouse gas emissions.
It is also a serious coal producer and user in the region.
“The government of Indonesia knows how important action against climate change is for their own country and people, and it has put a lot of work into steering the Bali negotiations,” says Hans Verolme, Director of WWF’s Global Climate Change Programme.
No one can escape from climate change in Indonesia.
But the effects will be felt more acutely by the poorest people, who are living in the most marginal areas that are vulnerable to drought, for example, or to floods and landslide.
Developed countries are responsible for the majority of greenhouse gas emissions which cause global warming, said United Nations Development Programme’s Country Director Hakan Bjorkman.
"The poor walk the earth with very light carbon footprint," Bjorkman said, but "they are set to suffer the most from the actions of a few.
"
Climate change in Australia and New Zealand spells an increase in water resource problems in both in southern and eastern Australia and, in New Zealand, in Northland and some eastern regions.
"Significant loss of biodiversity is projected to occur by 2020 in some ecologically-rich sites including the Great Barrier Reef and Queensland Wet Tropics.
Other sites at risk include Kakadu wetlands, south-west Australia, sub-Antarctic islands and the alpine areas of both countries.
Ongoing coastal development and population growth in areas such as Cairns and Southeast Queensland (Australia) and Northland to Bay of Plenty (New Zealand), are projected to exacerbate risks from sea-level rise and increases in the severity and frequency of storms and coastal flooding by 2050.
Production from agriculture and forestry by 2030 is projected to decline over much of southern and eastern Australia, and over parts of eastern New Zealand, due to increased drought and fire.
However, in New Zealand, initial benefits to agriculture and forestry are projected in western and southern areas and close to major rivers due to a longer growing season, less frost and increased rainfall.
The region has substantial adaptive capacity due to well-developed economies and scientific and technical capabilities, but there are considerable constraints to implementation and major challenges from changes in extreme events.
Natural systems have limited adaptive capacity.” (Working Group II Contribution to the IPCC, 4th Assessment Report, Climate Change Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, Summary for Policy Makers.

Australia: The likelihood that precipitation will fall as snow will decrease as temperature rises.
Modelling of snowfall and snow cover in the Australian Alps projects temperature and precipitation changes very marked reductions in snow.
The total alpine area with at least 30 days of snow cover decreases 14 to 54% by 2020, and 30 to 93% by 2050.
New Zealand: Because of projected increased winter precipitation over the southern Alps, it is less clear that mountain snow will be reduced in New Zealand.
A report in 2007, developed by CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology through the Australian Climate Change Science Program, provides the most up to date assessment of Australia's changing climate.

Further, the report indicates there will be changes in temperature extremes, with fewer frosts and substantially more days over 35 ºC.

The previous Prime Minister, John Howard claimed that "to call climate change the overwhelming moral challenge for this generation is misguided, or even misleading".
This was one of the saddest moment in Mr Howard's commentary on climate change, and shows he simply did not understand the basic connection between economics and the environment.
It also underscores his climate scepticism and flew in the face of hard science provided by agencies like; the International Panel on Climate Change, the Stern Report, and even the science provided by his own departments e.g.
the CSIRO, the Australian Greenhouse Office and the Australian Bureau of Meteorology.
The current Rudd Government came to power on the back of a climate vote but so far (apart from ratifying the Kyoto Protocol ) has delivered very little more than the previous government in terms of tackling climate change.
The coal fired economy continues to belch smoke and nothing much is happening on the renewable energy front compared to other countries.
The 'market' will take care of everything approach is not going to work.
Climate change is a moral challenge, what we do today impacts on future generations and reduces their opportunity.
Guess we could take the same approach to herion use, and say the market will take care of supply and demand.
Sure it would, but our society would be much worse off.
Strong and resolute leadership is required to make the changes required.
As clearly stated in the Stern Report, we simply cannot afford NOT to address climate change.
In Australia and if we moved to 25% renewable energy, household electricity bills would rise by just $1.23 a week (A Bright Future, Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF), Greenpeace and the Climate Change Action Network (CCAN)).
As an Australian, and if you happened upon this site, I urge you to consider the 3 Step Climate Action Plan; take personal responsibility, motivate our leaders and communicate the urgency for climate action.
The 2007 election and change to a Labor government proves that Australians do care!
We encourage all Australians to adopt the 3 Step Climate Action Plan.
Within the Asia Pacific region, Australia makes a disproportionate contribution to climate change as the highest per capita greenhouse polluter in the industrialised world.
Despite our relatively modest population, the average Australian produces more greenhouse pollution, uses more energy and has historically contributed more to the build-up in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere than the average person in any other country in the region.
On average, Australians create more then eight times the greenhouse pollution per person than the average Chinese person, and have contributed more than 170 times the amount of greenhouse pollution to the atmosphere than a Bangladeshi.
While Australia is highly susceptible to the impacts of climate change, we have more resources and expertise and therefore greater resilience to cope with and respond to natural disasters, unlike many of our neighbours in the Asia Pacific region.

O abundances decrease in the stratosphere, for example, falling to about 120 ppb by 30 km at mid-latitudes.
O and NO from soils in response to external N inputs is important, given the projected increases of N fertilisation and deposition increases in tropical countries (Matson et al., 1999).
Tropical ecosystems, currently an important source of N
O (and NO) are often phosphorus-limited rather than being N-limited like the Northern Hemispheric terrestrial ecosystems.
Nitrogen fertiliser inputs into these phosphorus-limited ecosystems generate NO and N
O fluxes that are 10 to 100 times greater than the same fertiliser addition to nearby N-limited ecosystems (Hall and Matson, 1999).
In addition to N availability, soil N
O emissions are regulated by temperature and soil moisture and so are likely to respond to climate changes (Frolking et al., 1998; Parton et al., 1998).
The magnitude of this response will be affected by feedbacks operating through the biospheric carbon cycle (Li et al., 1992, 1996).
O include nylon production, nitric acid production, fossil fuel fired power plants, and vehicular emissions.
It was once thought that emission from automobile catalytic converters were a potential source of N
O are photodissociation (90%) and reaction with electronically excited oxygen atoms (O(1D)); they occur in the stratosphere and lead to an atmospheric lifetime of 120 years (SAR; Volk et al., 1997; Prinn and Zander, 1999).
The small uptake of N
O abundance for the last 1,000 years as determined from ice cores, firn, and whole air samples.
Data sets are from: Machida et al.
(1995); Battle et al.
(1996); Langenfelds et al.
(1996); Steele et al.
(1996); Flückiger et al.
(1999). Radiative forcing, approximated by a linear scale, is plotted on the right axis.
Deseasonalised global averages are plotted in the inset (Butler et al., 1998b).
O derives from the flux-weighted isotopic composition of sources corrected for fractionation during destruction in the stratosphere.
Typical observed values are
O (e.g., Kim and Craig, 1993), and so other processes (sources or sinks) must lead to isotopic enrichment.
Rahn and Wahlen (1997) use stratospheric air samples to show that the tropospheric isotope signature of N
O are needed.
Yung and Miller (1997) point out that large isotopic fractionation can occur in the stratosphere during photolysis due to small differences in the zero point energies of the different isotopic species, and Rahn et al.
(1998) have verified this latter effect with laboratory measurements.
Wingen and Finlayson-Pitts (1998) failed to find evidence that reaction of CO
O trend was affected by stratospheric circulation changes induced by massive increase in stratospheric aerosols following the eruption of Mt.
Pinatubo. Since 1993, the N
O on its own lifetime (Prather, 1998) has been examined for this assessment with additional studies from established 2-D stratospheric chemical models.
All models give similar results, see Table 4.5 .

The Niger Delta The Niger Delta is located in the Atlantic Coast of southern Nigeria where River Niger divides into numerous tributaries.
It is the second largest delta in the world with a coastline spanning about 450 kilometres terminating at the Imo River entrance.
The region spans over 20,000 square kilometres and it has been described as the largest wetland in Africa and among the three largest in the world.
About 2,370 square kilometres of the Niger Delta area consist of rivers, creeks and estuaries and while stagnant swamp covers about 8600 square kilometres.
The delta, with mangrove swamps spanning about 1900 square kilometres has the largest mangrove swamps in Africa.
The region falls within the tropical rain forest zone.
The ecosystem of the area is highly diverse and supportive of numerous species of terrestrial and aquatic flora and fauna and human life.
As opined by Iyayi (2004), it is richest wetland in the world.
The region is divided into four ecological zones namely coastal inland zone, mangrove swamp zone, freshwater zone and lowland rain forest zone.
Politically, the Niger Delta area cuts across nine states in southern Nigeria which include Abia (1), Akwa Ibom (2), Bayelsa (3), Cross River (4), Delta (5), Edo (6), Imo (7), Ondo (8) and River (9) States (Fig.
1.0). The region has emerged as one of the most ecologically sensitive region in Nigeria.
Resources (oil and gas) from the region are the main source of revenue for the Nigerian state, accounting for about 97% of the country’s total export.
Oil was first discovered in the region in 1958 and since the early 1970s, oil has dominated the country’s economy.
Costal Erosion and Floods According to the International Federation of Red Cross (IFRC, 1999), sea level rise and flooding are already affecting millions of people worldwide.
IFRC report revealed that an estimated 10 million people are at constant risk of coastal flood and floods in general are making 3 million people homeless every year, and that the number of people affected by sea level rise is on the increase annually.
The occurrence of coastal erosion has been reported in the Niger Delta by Okon and Egbon (1999).
The report of Udofa and Fajemirokun (1978) showed a rise in sea level along Nigerian coastal water.
They did a mechanical analysis of tide data from 1960 – 1970 and reported mean sea level rise to be 0.462m above zero level of the tide gauge.
Agbola and Olurin (2003) reported that the World Bank ranked coastal erosion as needing moderate priority attention in the Niger Delta.
Also, the Nigerian Environmental Study/Action Team (NEST, 2004), reported that sea-level rise and repeated ocean surges will not only worsen the problems of coastal erosion that are already a menace in the Niger Delta, the associated inundation will increase problems of floods, intrusion of sea-water into fresh water sources and ecosystems destroying such stabilizing system as mangrove, and affecting agriculture, fisheries and general livelihoods.
The most important environmental problem facing the Niger Delta is coastal erosion.
Although the World Bank has rated coastal erosion as needing moderate attention in the region, it is the most important impact of sea level rise in the region and should be given high priority attention.
Flooding of low-lying areas in the region has been observed.
Settlements in the coastal region have been uprooted by coastal erosion.
In some places, especially in Forcados, some oil wells have been lost to the ocean due to erosion.
Coastal erosion poses serious problem for the economic activities in the Niger Delta especially natural sectors such as farming and fisheries (about 50% of the fishes consumed in Nigeria is from the Niger Delta).
Coastal vegetation especially the mangroves have been lost to coastal erosion (Awosika, 1995).
The Niger Delta could lose over 15000 square kilometers of land by the year 2100 with a one meter rise in sea level.
Calculations have also shown that a 20cm rise in sea level will inundate 3400 km2 of the Nigerian coastland (Onofeghara, 1990).
It is estimated that with a sea level rise of 30cm, about 1 to 2 million people will be affected.
In all this, it is predicted that Nigeria will lose about $9 billion as a result of the sea level rise while at least 80% of the people of the Niger Delta will be displaced due to the low level of the region.
Other adverse effects of sea level rise in the Niger Delta is increased salinity of both surface and underground water due to the instruction of sea water.
This will lead to the death of aquatic plants and animals that can not tolerate high salinity.
Some terrestrial plants that have low tolerance for high salinity will also be affected.
Sea water instruction will have serious impact on food security in the region; because of it impacts on coastal agriculture.
The salinization of underground water will lead to shortage of fresh water.
Inhabitants of the region depend on underground water as their main source of water for drinking and for other domestic use.
Other impact of sea level rise on the region is the emergence of health-related hazards.
General Flooding While climate change will lead to increase aridity and desertification in northern Nigeria, it will lead to increase in flooding in the southern part especially in the coastal regions.
Adverse impact resulting from the phenomenon will increase if sufficient effort is not made globally to tackle the problem.
Apart from coastal erosion, flood in general has impacted negatively the livelihood of many communities in the region.
Flood and erosion remove top soil, destroy roads, affect fresh water resources and threaten lives and properties.
Many people have been rendered homeless by floods and several roads have been made impassable.
The usefulness of several roads has become seasonal, only passable during the dry months of the year.
In Egor and Ogida communities in Edo State, several houses have been abandoned by the owners due to floods and many more areas in the region are vulnerable to floods.
Owners of the affected houses did not anticipate the problem they now find themselves when their houses were being built.
For occupants of some of the affected houses who are unable to relocate for financial reason will have to cope with the situation.
This makes them vulnerable to different kinds of water-related disease such as malaria, dysentery, cholera, and diarrhea.
Trauma resulting from the problem can lead to non-pathogenic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes.
In some other instances, some areas are cut off from other parts of the community as a result of flood.
Floods paralyze economic activities in many towns and cities in the region.
Major roads, some linking states are flooded causing hardship to motorists.
When these roads were constructed, the flooding problems were not there, and the companies that constructed the roads probably did not anticipate the problem.
One common consequence of flooding is increase in transport fare.
Commercial drivers, to make up for the distance they drive to avoid flooded roads, usually increase their fare putting the burden on their passengers causing the general increase in the cost of goods and services.
Change in Rainfall Pattern Meteorological data have shown that rainfall pattern in Nigeria has changed in the past decades.
Oladipo (1995) reported that the decline in rainfall in Nigeria started at the beginning of the 1960s when a decade of relatively wet years ended.
According to him, the persistence of below-mean rainfall in the last two decades in Nigeria is an indication of an abrupt change in climate.
The Niger Delta lie predominantly in the tropics having two seasons – the wet and dry seasons.
The wet season occur from May to September, while the dry season begins in October and ends in April.
Food security has been defined as the ability of people to grow and obtain food (Sarah La Trobe, 2002).
The agricultural sector in Nigeria is highly sensitive to rainfall pattern especially in southern Nigeria where rain-fed agriculture is mainly practiced.
It has been predicted that climate change will pose serious threat to food security.
Climate change creates uncertainty in the rainfall pattern (timing and amount) and affects agricultural activities.
Agriculture in the Niger Delta is highly dependent on rain and irrigation is seldom practiced.
The changes in the rainfall pattern have greatly affected the agriculture in the region.
Farmers in the region begin cultivation at the end of the dry season, when the rain begins to fall.
They plant their crops after the first or second rain in the month of March, and sometime in April.
After the first rain, the rain falls periodically till the months of June/July (the peak of the rainy season), when rain fall more or less continually.
The periodic rainfall pattern before the peak in June enables farmers to cultivate various crops.
Because of the change in rainfall pattern, farmers who plant after the first or second rain in run into huge loss when the rains are delayed beyond the usual due to climatic changes.
The crops are scotched causing huge economic loss.
Before this time farmers can predict the rain and they know precisely when to plant their crops.
The crops after they are planted are watered periodically by rain before the peak of the rainfall in June.
The amount of rainfall within the period before the peak is necessary for the optimum performance of many crops most especially the maize which is widely consumed in every part of Nigeria.
Change in Vegetation One important feature observed in the region is the almost complete absence of primary forests.
This may be partly due to climate change and partly due to human activities.
Uncontrolled logging, agricultural activities, acid rain, oil exploration and exploitation, urbanization and mining activities contribute to lose of vegetation.
The vegetation of some part of the Niger Delta is dominated by grasses, sedges and shrubs with few scattered trees and they were mainly palm trees.
In other parts, trees grow close to one another to form thick canopy over undergrowths.
The changes in vegetation will have great implication for biological productivity consequently affecting biomass production.
It will lead to the impoverishment of biodiversity and various plant species presently growing in the region may die off.
The regeneration rate of biomass may also decline significantly affecting the amount of fuel wood available for local people.
Fall in the availability of biomass for local energy generation will bring more hardship to local people.
Many will have to travel long distance in search for fuel wood, women and children will be affected the most since they are traditionally charged with the responsibility of fetching fuel wood for the house.
Integrated Approach to Developing the Niger Delta We can see so far that the people of the Niger Delta are faced with myriads of environmental problems caused by climate change and the activities of multinational oil companies operating in the region.
We therefore propose an integrated approach in solving the problem in the Niger Delta.
By an integrated approach, we mean a combination of several development strategies packaged into one piece in a way that it will be more effective.
The integrated approach must have this key element.
It must be participatory.
The local people are the primary targets of development and development can only be precisely defined by them.
It is only the definition of the local people to whom development strategies is directed at that is acceptable.
Thus every development strategic must seek to view development from the perspective of the local people.
The United Nations Declaration on the Rights to Development of 1986 recognized that the human person is the central subject of the development process and that development policy should therefore make the human being the main participant and beneficiary of development.
The integrated approach must x-ray the needs of the local people and design an all-encompassing strategy to address these needs.
The needs of the local people vary from community to community and among the different groups in the society – the men, women and youths.
An integrated approach will target the different groups.
It is of utmost importance to conduct detailed studies to ascertain the priority needs of communities before embarking on any project.
The needs of the various communities should be addressed in order of priority, starting from the most important to the least.
For example, if the priority need of a particular community is the provision of portable drinking water, the people may feel dissatisfied if they are provided with electricity.
Integrated approach must also seek to understand the existing coping strategies of the local people to changes in their environment and build on them through policy formulation with adequate participation of the local people.
An effective coping strategy will reduce vulnerability to climate change and other changes in the environment.
An in-depth understanding of how individuals, communities and natural system can prepare for and respond to changes in climate and non-climate shocks is important to reducing vulnerability to adverse changes in the environment.
While it is a palpable truism that industrialization enhances socio-economic development, it is important to note that industrialization without the right technologies is unsustainable and may become inimical to the local people.
This is the case in the Niger Delta.
Industrial development should be accomplished with technologies that are environmentally friendly.
The multinational oil companies operating in the region should develop technologies that will minimize the impact of their activities on the environment.
For instance, old-fashioned flaring of gas can be replaced by converting the gas into other useful products.
Chemical experts are on the opinion that instead of flaring gas, it can be converted to alcohol and put into diverse uses.
The government and the multinational companies should be involved in environmental restoration activities.
Such activities may include aforestation, support for sustainable agriculture and fishery, establishment of environmental management institutions and research institution, and policy formulation for the preservation of wildlife and other endangered species.
There cannot be enjoyment of any resources if the people do not have control over their resources.
It is a case of forcefully taking from the people what belongs to them and given it to somebody else.
This is unethical and legislations supporting such acts are criminal.
If resources are discovered in any community that are of commercial value for the state, the government should carry out adequate consultation with the community and enter into agreement with them before the exploitation of the resources.
The consultations and agreements should be well documented.
The provision in the Nigerian constitution vesting the control of all resource in Nigeria solely in the states should be repealed.
The constitution should therefore allow the local people gain control of the resources from their land.
In the Nigerian constitution, at the bridge of environmental rights, there is no provision for individuals, agencies and communities to sue for enforcement of environmental rights.
The power to sue for environmental rights is vested only in the state.
The question is what happens when the state or it collaborators are the one directly involve in the bridge of environmental rights?
Therefore, provision should be given in the constitution to allow individuals, communities and agencies to sue for enforcement of environmental rights.
When there is a breach in environmental rights, individuals, groups and communities are the ones affected.
For sustainable development to be achieved in the Niger Delta, the region must gain control of their land and mineral resources taken away from them through military decrees that have been enacted into laws in the Nigerian constitution.

Generally bricks have to be fired, this takes a large amount of wood to produce charcoal that is then used to heat the bricks for an extended time.
This is all made redundant when you know that if you remove the topsoil from the ground throughout much of southern Africa you have ready access to subsoil that can be mixed with a small quantity of cement and then compressed to form Stabilised Soil Blocks, that can then be used for creating buildings, water storage tanks, septic tanks etc., the latest version are ISSB's --they also interlock.

The legendary broadcaster and naturalist Sir David Attenborough was long unsure about the causes of the observed climate warming.
In his documentary, The Truth About Climate Change, he sheds doubt and explains what convinced him.
Climate models based on purely natural processes such as solar activity and volcanic eruptions fail to explain the observed change in Earth's climate in the latter part of the 20th century.
Models factoring in the human impact, that is, the increase of carbon dioxide in the athmosphere, depict the transpired warming accurately.

There are many climate feedback mechanisms in the climate system that can either amplify (‘positive feedback’) or diminish (‘negative feedback’) the effects of a change in climate forcing.
For example, as rising concentrations of greenhouse gases warm Earth’s climate, snow and ice begin to melt.
This melting reveals darker land and water surfaces that were beneath the snow and ice, and these darker surfaces absorb more of the Sun’s heat, causing more warming, which causes more melting, and so on, in a self reinforcing cycle.
This feedback loop, known as the ‘ice-albedo feedback’, amplifies the initial warming caused by rising levels of greenhouse gases.
Detecting, understanding and accurately quantifying climate feedbacks have been the focus of a great deal of research by scientists unravelling the complexities of Earth’s climate.
Adding more of a greenhouse gas, such as CO2, to the atmosphere intensifies the greenhouse effect, thus warming Earth’s climate.
The amount of warming depends on various climate feedback mechanisms.
For example, as the atmosphere warms due to rising levels of greenhouse gases, its concentration of water vapour increases, further intensifying the greenhouse effect.
This in turn causes more warming, which causes an additional increase in water vapour, in a self-reinforcing cycle.
This water vapour feedback may be strong enough to approximately double the increase in the greenhouse effect due to the added CO2 alone.
Additional important climate feedback mechanisms involve clouds.
Clouds are effective at absorbing infrared radiation and therefore exert a large greenhouse effect, thus warming the Earth.
Clouds are also effective at reflecting away incoming solar radiation, thus cooling the Earth.
A change in almost any aspect of clouds, such as their type, location, water content, cloud altitude, particle size and shape, or lifetimes, affects the degree to which clouds warm or cool the Earth.
Some changes amplify warming while others diminish it.
Much research is in progress to better understand hown clouds change in response to climate warming, and how these changes affect climate through various feedback mechanisms.
An important feedback is the release of carbon from ecosystems due to changing climatic conditions.
The dieback of high-carbon ecosystems, such as the Amazon, due to changes in regional precipitation patterns, has been predicted from some models, but it has not yet been observed.
Laboratory studies have indicated accelerated decomposition of soil organic matter in temperate forests and grasslands due to temperature and precipitation changes, or the CO2-induced enhancement of decomposition by mycorrhizae.
Sea Ice...how is it changing?
Compollation of research by EU
The EU's science framework includes a significant amount of emphasis on better understanding climate change.
A Dec '05 meeting lead to the production of a book ( PDF ) on sea ice research, pulling together much of the science available on changes in the Arctic region.
The wide-ranging papers in the book cover the methods used to measure ice thickness, on scales from basinwide down to local; the results obtained; the modelling of ice thickness;and the implications for Man’s activities.
Palaeoclimatic studies are also described, which reveal periods during the past 100,000 years when the Arctic Ocean has been ice-free, a challenge to our understanding of Earth system processes.
Since the disappearance of the Arctic sea ice is literally the most visible aspect of global warming in action – we can see the change in the face of the planet from space - it is appropriate that the European Commission should take the initiative in seeking to understand this phenomenon.
Inuit activist honoured by the United Nations for climate change work.
Evidence of climate change is being seen right now in indigenous communities in the Arctic.
Some people outside of the Arctic assume that climate change would be a good thing for Arctic peoples, if it means that the weather will get warmer.
Unfortunately, that is unlikely to be the case.
Arctic peoples are well adapted to their environment, and to using the plants and animals that are adapted to the cold northern weather.
As the weather gets warmer, people, plants and animals are becoming stressed.
Saami are seeing their reindeer grazing pastures change, Inuit are watching polar bears waste away because of a lack of sea ice, and peoples across the Arctic are reporting new species, particularly insects.
Some communities are having to sand-bag their shorelines to try to slow down an increase in coastal erosion, while in others, buildings, pipes, and roads are slumping because the permafrost is thawing.
Vital travel routes linking communities to each other and to harvesting sites are becoming dangerously unpredictable.
Routes across the ice become dangerous when the ice thins, or thaws at times different from the past, and water routes can also become dangerous as water flows change.
Climate mitigation is any action taken to permanently eliminate or reduce the long-term risk and hazards of climate change to human life, property.
The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines mitigation as: “An anthropogenic intervention to reduce the sources or enhance the sinks of greenhouse gases.”
Climate adaptation refers to the ability of a system to adjust to climate change (including climate variability and extremes) to moderate potential damage, to take advantage of opportunities, or to cope with the consequences.
The IPCC defines adaptation as the, “adjustment in natural or human systems to a new or changing environment.
Adaptation to climate change refers to adjustment in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities.
Various types of adaptation can be distinguished, including anticipatory and reactive adaptation, private and public adaptation, and autonomous and planned adaptation.”
The terms “adaptation” and “mitigation” are two important terms that are fundamental in the climate change debate.
The IPCC defined adaptation as adjustment in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli or their effects, which moderate harm or exploits beneficial opportunities.
Similarly, Mitchell and Tanner (2006) defined adaptation as an understanding of how individuals, groups and natural systems can prepare for and respond to changes in climate or their environment.
According to them, it is crucial to reducing vulnerability to climate change.
While mitigation tackles the causes of climate change, adaptation tackles the effects of the phenomenon.
The potential to adjust in order to minimize negative impact and maximize any benefits from changes in climate is known as adaptive capacity.
A successful adaptation can reduce vulnerability by building on and strengthening existing coping strategies.
In general the more mitigation there is, the less will be the impacts to which we will have to adjust, and the less the risks for which we will have to try and prepare.
Conversely, the greater the degree of preparatory adaptation, the less may be the impacts associated with any given degree of climate change.
For people today, already feeling the impacts of past inaction in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, adaptation is not altogether passive, rather it is an active adjustment in response to new stimuli.
However, our present age has proactive options (mitigation), and must also plan to live with the consequences (adaptation) of global warming.
The idea that less mitigation means greater climatic change, and consequently requiring more adaptation is the basis for the urgency surrounding reductions in greenhouse gases.
Climate mitigation and adaptation should not be seen as alternatives to each other, as they are not discrete activities but rather a combined set of actions in an overall strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Climate change involves complex interactions between climatic, environmental, economic, political, institutional, social, and technological processes.
It cannot be addressed or comprehended in isolation of broader societal goals (such as equity or sustainable development), or other existing or probable future sources of stress.
In the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) three conditions are made explicit when working towards the goal of greenhouse gas stabilisation in the atmosphere:
1.
That it should take place within a time-frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change;
To eliminate or reduce the risk of climate change to human life and property, both policy instruments and technology must be used in the context of sustainable development.
The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change refers to adaptation in several of its articles: Article 4.1(f): All Parties shall “Take climate change considerations into account, to the extent feasible, in their relevant social, economic and environmental policies and actions, and employ appropriate methods, for example impact assessments, formulated and determined nationally, with a view to minimizing adverse effects on the economy, on public health and on the quality of the environment, of projects or measures undertaken by them to mitigate or adapt to climate change.”
Nicholas Stern on Climate Mitigation and Adaptation
For developing countries, good adaptation and good development policy are very strongly intertwined, and it is right that climate change should now become central to national planning processes and to development assistance.
International support for adaptation will come in large part through the delivery of the commitments made by rich countries to double aid by 2010 and the commitments made by many countries to meet the target of 0.7% of GNI by 2015.
This will deliver an increase of hundreds of billions of dollars.
Development and diversification are still important strategies wherever possible, but ultimately the international community will have to find ways to support alternative responses, including the managed resettlement of some people in these states.
This will bring many challenges, particularly for those people that must move.
There will be much greater pressures if unabated climate change leads to sea level rise that threatens much larger populations in low-lying coastal areas.
(from the Stern Review postcript, Janauary 2007)
Running counter to the technological and economic potential for greenhouse gas emissions reduction are rapid economic development and accelerating change in some socio-economic and behavioural trends that are increasing total energy use, especially in developed countries and high-income groups in developing countries.
Dwelling units and vehicles in many countries are growing in size, and the intensity of electrical appliance use is increasing.
Use of electrical office equipment in commercial buildings is increasing.
In developed countries, and especially the USA, sales of larger, heavier, and less efficient vehicles are also increasing.
Some adaptation is occurring now, to observed and projected future climate change, but on a limited basis.
See the IPCC page on current climate mitigation and adaptation.
UN Climate Conference: The countdown to Copenhagen
In 331 days' time, 15,000 officials from 200 countries will gather in the Danish capital with 1 goal: to find a solution to global warming.
Michael McCarthy, Environment Editor, presents the first in a series of dispatches on the crucial summit
The UN Climate Conference will try to work out a way for the world to act together to preserve the thin envelope of atmosphere, soil and sea which surrounds our planet and enables us to live, in the face of rising temperatures which threaten to destroy its habitability
Three hundred and thirty-one days, plus a final frantic fortnight: not very long, really, to put together the most complex and vital agreement the world has ever seen.
But that's all the time there is: in 331 days from now, on 7 December, the UN Climate Conference will open in Copenhagen and the world community will try to agree a solution to the gravest threat it has ever faced: global warming.
If that sounds like exaggeration, we need only glance at some historical comparisons.
The Copenhagen meeting will have a far broader reach and potential impact on the world than the Congress of Vienna, say, the 1814-1815 assembly which attempted to reorder Europe after the Napoleonic wars, or the Paris peace conference of 1919, which tried to construct a new global order after the First World War, or the 1945 meetings at Yalta and Potsdam which tried to do the same after the Second World War.
For they were all dealing with national boundaries, politics and political structures, phenomena which of course are vital in human terms, but ephemeral and changeable.
Copenhagen will be dealing with something fundamental to life on earth: the stability of the biosphere.
Known officially in UN-speak as COP 15 – the 15th meeting of the parties of the UN's Framework Convention on Climate Change – the meeting in Denmark will try to work out a way for the world to act together to preserve the thin envelope of atmosphere, soil and sea which surrounds our planet and enables us to live, in the face of rising temperatures which threaten to destroy its habitability.
All the world's major governments, including the once-sceptical administration of the US President George Bush, now formally accept that temperature rises have already begun, are likely if unchecked to prove disastrous for human civilisation, and are being caused by emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide from our power plants, factories and motor vehicles.
Differences like those stubbornly percolate the whole negotiating process and make achieving a universal agreement mind-bogglingly hard.
"This is the most complicated deal the world has ever tried to put together," says Tom Burke, visiting professor at Imperial College and an adviser on climate change to the Foreign Office.
"In effect, you're asking nearly 200 countries to align their energy policies – to create a common world energy policy.
If you look at how hard it has been for the member states of the European Union to align their energy policies, you get an idea of the difficulty of attempting it with the whole world.
"
Yet it has to be done, and the penalty for failure could not be higher.
It is just 20 years since the world woke up to the danger of rising carbon emissions destabilising the atmosphere.
Two decades ago it seemed a fairly distant threat, prefigured principally in supercomputer climate prediction programmes; something that was likely to happen a comfortably long distance away, such as at the end of the 21st century.
Three things have altered since then.
First, the changing climate is now visible, not just in computer predictions, but all around us: spring in southern Britain, for example, is arriving about three weeks earlier than it did 40 years ago.
At this time last year a red admiral butterfly, an archetypal creature of the summer, was photographed perching on a snowdrop, a flower of the winter – a previously unheard-of occurrence.
Second, it has become clear in the past five years that the earth is responding to the increasing CO2 loading of the atmosphere much more rapidly than scientists initially thought.
There are numerous examples but to instance just one, the summer sea ice of the Arctic Ocean is melting far more quickly than anyone imagined.
Third, it has become apparent, even more recently, that global emissions of CO2 are shooting up at a rate that far exceeds anything the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) thought possible when it sketched out future emissions scenarios in a special report in 2000.
Even though we have had 20 years to think about emissions cuts, and 11 years of the Kyoto protocol, the treaty which actually prescribed the first cuts for the industrialised countries, emissions are soaring as never before.
Some leading climate scientists are now openly voicing concerns that this makes it increasingly unlikely we can meet the aim of keeping global temperature rise to about 2C above the pre-industrial level, which is generally regarded as the most that may be endured by human society without mortal danger.
(We are now at about 0.75 degrees C above pre-industrial, and another 0.6 of a degree is thought to be inevitable because of the CO2 which has already been emitted).
Three conditions, according to Britain's Energy and Climate Change Secretary, Ed Miliband, have to be fulfilled for Copenhagen to be regarded as a success.
First, the wealthy industrialised countries have to agree tough new targets for cutting their C02.
Second, the developing countries led by China, even if they do not take on the same sort of numerical targets, have to move away from "business as usual".
And third, the rich nations have to agree a way of financing the developing countries, especially the poorer ones, in the measures they take to adapt to the climate change that is coming anyway.
Otherwise they won't sign up to anything.
Securing such a deal will be a matter of political will: a global political consensus will have to be hammered out.
It is becoming clear that, over the next 11 months, the world could well do with a high-level political fixer, jetting unceasingly from capital to capital, to pull such a consensus together, in the manner in which the Argentine diplomat, Raul Estrada, managed to pull the original Kyoto agreement together in the Japanese city in December 1997.
It could be Britain's Ed Miliband, according to Tom Burke.
"There has to be someone who can put the time in, and go round various capitals and talk to the key people at a very high level, and not just environment ministers," he says.
"Ed Miliband could play that role.
He's known to be close to Gordon Brown, and Britain is reasonably respected for its record on climate change.
It doesn't have to be him.
But there probably needs to be someone.
"
However, Mr Miliband, and the British Government, may face a problem of reduced credibility in climate change terms as a result of two policy decisions likely to be taken in the next few weeks.
One, which Mr Miliband will take personally, is whether or not to agree to a new coal-fired power station at Kingsnorth in Kent.
If he gives it the go-ahead, without strict controls over its emissions, environmentalists will accuse him of sanctioning a new generation of power plants run on the most carbon-intensive fuel.
The other is whether or not to allow Heathrow airport to build a third runway, and thus expand British aviation, whose CO2 emissions are growing faster than those of any other sector.
If both these projects go ahead – as seems perfectly possible – there is no doubt that the UK's position as a potential Copenhagen broker will be weakened.
"If countries like Britain, who, for better or worse, are the global leaders, go to Copenhagen with new coal-fired power stations and expanding airports at home, it's very difficult to see how we will be taken seriously by other countries which have even more serious energy security problems and concerns about economic growth," said Robin Oakley, the head of climate change at Greenpeace UK.
"That leadership can't just be shown by grandstanding at the meeting.
It has to be shown by what we do in our domestic policy.
"
In the absence of Mr Miliband or any other leading politician emerging as the Copenhagen fixer, the key player in the process is likely to be Barack Obama.
The President-elect has already opened a chasm, in terms of climate change policy, between himself and the outgoing George Bush, who, in 2001, withdrew the US from Kyoto and began years of climate policy obstructionism.
Whether or not they can do the deal the world needs is another matter.
Yet there is no doubt the world needs it.
It may seem reasonable to think, in the coldest winter for years, that global warming has gone away, yet nothing could be further from the truth.
China is aiming to increase its coal production by about 30 per cent by 2015 to meet its energy needs, the Government has announced, in a move likely to fuel concerns over global warming.
Such is the legacy of 8 years of the Bush administration blocking all national and international action on climate change, and indeed actively working to undermine international negotiations by creating a parallel do-nothing track for countries like China.
As Chinese officials have told me, we gave them the cover to accelerate emissions growth.
Changing China’s rapacious coal plans will arguably be Obama’s single greatest challenge in terms of preserving a livable climate and thus the health and well-being of future generations and thus any chance at a positive legacy for his presidency (see “ What will make Obama a great president, Part 2: A climate deal with China ”
China said coal, the cheapest and most plentiful source of fuel in the country, would remain its main energy source, despite the impact global warming had already had on the country.
That Chinese argument, I think, can now be officially labeled the insanity defense (see Hadley Center: “Catastrophic” 5-7°C warming by 2100 on current emissions path ).
Yes, the industrialized countries must sharply reduce their emissions — but absent a reversal of this Chinese coal policy, catastrophic climate impacts are inevitable.
[Note: I changed the headline from "single-handedly destroy the climate.
" Must give credit where credit is deserved to the rich countries for putting the climate in a position where China can finish it off.

In a stirring speech about climate change John Doerr quoted the mayor of a large city in China saying, “Do you think we will stop our progress so that you (Americans) can continue to do stupid things?” (John Doerr’s firm funds the Fisker.
Someone should tell him this is also a stupid thing.

Why did the north poles ice get frozen again like it was 29 years ago?
Are the polar bears going to be ok now?
what if it melts again while they are on it can they swim?
Some scientist says we might have another ice age can that happen?
If we keep having global warming how long before it way so hot too enjoy?
Now examine the region between Sahkahlin and Kamchatka, in the upper right.
Ice-covered 29 years ago, very little ice today.
Examine the Baltic sea, between Sweden and Finland.
Ice-free today, substantial ice-cover 29 years ago.
Examine the area between Quebec and New Brunswick.
Ice-free today, and substantial ice 29 years ago.
Note there was more ice north of Quebec and north of Scandinavia 29 years ago as well.
The arctic sea ice recovery this winter has been remarkable.
But it remains well-below average in both area and extent .
(Area and extent defined here .

I will say this, Joe’s final thought: “but absent a reversal of this Chinese coal policy, catastrophic climate impacts are inevitable.” is a lot worse than merely depressing.
And it doesn’t make me sad nearly as much as it makes me angry.
* The weather changes from day to day, and year to year, for natural reasons – for instance, the currents in the oceans can change (look up Southern Oscillation for an example).
However, over the past couple of decades there has been a trend towards warmer temperatures which is outside the normal range.
Thousands of scientists who are experts in climate around the world have come together in an organization called the IPCC, and have written a report that says that it is almost certain that the Earth is warming up, and this warming cannot be explained by normal natural variation.
* Individual scientists say lots of different things.
Smart people disagree all the time.
But almost all of the people who study climate say that the earth is warming, and will warm up more if we continue putting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
* Whether it will be “too hot to enjoy” depends on many things.
We can make estimates at what the climate will be in the future, but the estimates are not perfectly accurate, and also depend on things we can’t know exactly (for instance, how much greenhouse gas people will put into the air).
However, if you’re in elementary school, the estimates suggest that if we do nothing, by the time you retire the Earth will be much, much warmer than it is now, and this will have all sorts of bad effects.
For instance, there are entire countries in the South Pacific which are on islands that are only just above the sea level.
If it rises, even a little bit, their islands will be flooded and they will have to move permanently.
The boss of ExxonMobil, the world’s largest oil company, has called for a carbon tax to tackle global warming, marking a volte-face by the firm once described by Greenpeace as Climate Criminal No 1.
Assailed from all sides by scientists and a new cadre of US politicians, led by the President-elect, Barack Obama, the landmark concession by Rex Tillerson represents a nod to realpolitik after years when the company denied the existence of man-made global warming.
Exxon had already dropped its funding of lobby groups which deny the science of climate change and begun to take a softer public line, but even Mr Tillerson admitted that propounding a carbon tax had stuck in the craw until recently.
However, with European-style “cap and trade” rules governing carbon emissions moving up the agenda in the US, a carbon tax may be the least worst option, he said.
Environmental groups gave a sceptical response to Exxon’s U-turn, calling it a deliberate attempt to torpedo the movement for outright carbon caps and any early switch to alternative energy.
“A carbon tax is also the most efficient means of reflecting the cost of carbon in all economic decisions – from investments made by companies to fuel their requirements, to the product choices made by consumers,” Mr Tillerson said in a speech to the Woodrow Wilson Centre for International Scholars, a Washington think-tank.
“As a businessman it is hard to speak favourably about any new tax.
But a carbon tax strikes me as a more direct, a more transparent and a more effective approach.”
The chief executive’s comments are aimed at moving ExxonMobil decisively to the centre of the political debate about global warming in a year that will see world leaders meet in Copenhagen to establish a successor to the Kyoto treaty on climate change – something that threatens to fatally weaken the long-term prospects for oil companies who are refusing to invest in alternative energy, such as Exxon.
I support Al Gore’s proposal to build the smart grid and transmission lines necessary and generate 100% of our energy in the USA from renewables.
It will be very expensive and take a huge national effort but it’s less costly than coal will be to our future and will provide a lasting, positive solution.
No messy toxic waste from the ash either.
This post is by James Wang, Ph.D., a climate scientist at Environmental Defense.
You may have heard about the persistent droughts in the western U.S., Australia, and other regions.
The Upper Colorado River Basin is experiencing a protracted, multi-year drought that started in 1999.
Australia’s record drought is threatening the livelihood of traditional farmers and ranchers.
At what point does a passing drought become a permanent shift to desert conditions, and why would such a thing happen?
It can happen because of global warming.
Climate change can alter global winds, the strength and location of high and low pressure systems, and other climate factors.
Global winds shape the Earth’s climate, determining – in broad strokes – which areas are tropical, desert, or temperate.
Here’s a simplified overview of how it
The Sun heats the Earth most intensely in the tropical zone around the equator.
The heated air rises, cools, and then dumps its moisture as rain.
That’s why there are rain forests in the tropics.
The now drier air is forced by the continuously rising equatorial air to move towards the temperate latitudes on either side of the equator.
At roughly 30° N and S – called the “horse latitudes” – it can move no further due to the Earth’s rotation, and settles to the surface.
As the air sinks, it compresses and warms, creating hot, rain-free conditions.
This circulation pattern, called a Hadley cell, is why the deserts of the world are located just poleward of the tropics, to the north and south.
Poleward of the desert belt, strong, high-altitude winds known as the jet streams flow from west to east, carrying large storms with them.
These mid-latitude, temperate-region storms are an important source of rain and snow, especially during the winter season.
Much of the world’s population lives in the temperate region.
It includes most of the U.S. and southern Canada, most of Europe, East Asia, southern South America, southern Africa, and southern Australia and New Zealand.
But climate regions aren’t fixed.
Several independent studies have found that global winds are shifting due to global warming, and the shifts are faster than predicted by climate models.
Most recently is this new study in Nature Geoscience.
The tropical belt has widened by several degrees latitude since 1979.
This is consistent with other observations suggesting that the jet streams and storm tracks have moved poleward.
The drought-stricken Upper Colorado River Basin, which includes Lake Powell, is located just poleward of the horse latitudes at around 37° N. This has historically been in the temperate zone, but the desert zone may be gradually encroaching upon it.
(Since nothing is simple, there are other factors contributing to this particular drought, as well.
) Similarly, water-starved Sydney, Australia at 34° S is just poleward of the southern horse latitude.
What we may be seeing here is not so much drought as desertification – a shift in global climate patterns due to global warming.
Areas that used to be in temperate zones may be shifting into desert, while areas that had been arid receive more precipitation.
The increase in coal production mentioned in the Canberra Times was announced as part of the National Plan for Mineral Resources, 2008-2015, which you can read about here (if you can read Chinese, otherwise run it through Babelfish):
OK, so what does all that prove?
First of all, I want to get past the tendency to think of everything out of China as just “China”, one big aggregate.
China is just another country, and its power companies are just companies.
They are big and powerful, but they can’t be that different to utilities elsewhere in the world.
So if anyone out there is despairing as to how “China” could ever move away from coal, just think about how it might happen in your own backyard, first of all, and then imagine that transposed to China.
China is a one-party technocratic state, but otherwise it’s not that different to the average developed country.
You have the same mix of social and economic forces – media, community groups, unions, regulators, local government, business.
The task is fundamentally no bigger there than it is elsewhere.
And if anyone’s feeling adventurous, they might want to actually make contact with Chinese power companies, environmentalists, or regulators, and begin to forge a constructive relationship.
So here are two final links: websites on Chinese climate and Chinese climate policy.
China has climate scientists and they know they are losing the mountain glaciers and ocean fisheries, and the desert is engulfing Beijing due to GHGs.
I guess the deniers are still in charge there too.
Track record so far: Spain and tiny Portugal have made real progress with renewables, Germany is trying, France has gone nuclear, and the rest of us – mostly just talk.
There must be a titanic internal struggle between energy reformers and energy traditionalists – and the traditionaists are making a play/stand – so that they can leverage maximum concessions from western powers in the upcoming climate treaties.
My bet is that this is more a negotiating tactic prior to Obama taking office and those up coming climate negotiations.
the article in the Canberra Times speaks about China increasing its coal, oil and gas production.
This is not the same as increasing the consumption.
China has become a major importer of coal, gas and oil during the past couple of years.
At least in theory, China could increase its domestic fossil fuel production to increase its energy independence, while keeping consumption constant.
For climate change, it is past, current and future consumption that is important, not so much production.
Please be a bit more precise when it comes to writing about China and climate change.
Imports were also boosted by the scrapping of the import tariffs on June 1.
1.
Health. The issue of climate change is a sort of ’secondary’ issue for the Chinese.
Coal production and use of it kills close to 400,000 people a year there.
The savings in this, both human and financial would be huge by a switch to nuclear.
2.
The Chinese rail system is fraught with ‘weakness’ do to the geographic location of where the coal is mined…in the north, and to where it needs to be used, in the south.
They are “always upgrading” their rail but snows, natural disasters, have shown the severe limitations of rail.
So they are addressing this two ways.
Stephen Chu’s confirmation hearing starts tomorrow in front of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
Climate Science Watch submitted some questions, one of which pertains to Chinese coal fired power generation emissions, if you accept that the developed world should lead on developing carbon capture and storage technology and help finance its transfer to the developing world to reduce the emissions resulting from coal use:
Climate Science Watch question “4) The poor way the Energy Department under the Bush administration handled R&D on carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) for coal combustion, including the late-stage cancellation of FutureGen, has caused needless delays in resolving critical issues germane to determining the viability of this climate mitigation option.
How do you plan to expedite an R&D program needed to ascertain the feasibility of CCS in a timely enough manner to avert the disastrous climate change consequences we are facing?”
A climate refugee is someone displaced by climate change induced environmental disasters.
Such disasters are the result of incremental and rapid ecological change and disruption that include increased droughts, desertification, sea level rise, and the more frequent occurrence of extreme weather events such as hurricanes, cyclones, flooding and tornados.
The term climate refugee is seen by some as an inappropriate term, and they would rather see it replaced with environmental migrant.
Many people have raised objections to the use of the term 'refugee' in a climate context as it becomes mixed up with the legally defined term in the Refugee Convention of 1951.
This Convention classifies refugees as those who are fleeing from violence and political intimidation.
The inhabitants of the Carteret Islands are climate refugees caused by sea level rise, and other inhabitants of low lying islands and Island states are also at risk.
Tuvalu is especially susceptible to changes in sea level and storm surges and is likely to be another casualty.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the international science body that regularly produces assessment reports on climate change, suggested 200 million environmental refugees would exist by 2050.
In this projection, the impacts of climate change, including coastal flooding, shoreline erosion and agricultural degradation were seen as major factors contributing to bulk of environmental refugees.
Seawater intrusion into freshwater aquifers in deltaic and non-deltaic areas is an increasing problem with rising sea level, and has been documented in diverse environments such as the arid Israeli coast, the humid Thailand coast, the Chinese Yangtze Delta, the Vietnamese Mekong Delta, and low-lying atolls.
In the Yangtze delta, one consequence of saltwater incursion will be that during dry seasons shortages of freshwater for agriculture are likely to be more pronounced and agricultural yields seriously reduced particularly around Shanghai.
The most destructive element associated with an intense cyclone is storm surge.
Storm surge heights depend on the intensity of the cyclone, i.e., very high-pressure gradient and consequent very strong winds and the topography of seabed near the point where a cyclone crosses the coast.
Sea level also rises due to astronomical high tide.
Elevation of the total sea level increases when peak surge occurs at the time of high tide.
Past history indicates that loss of life is significant when surge magnitude is 3 metres or more and catastrophic when 5 metres and above.
Storm-surge flooding in Bangladesh has caused very high mortality in the coastal population (e.g., at least 225,000 in November 1970 and 138,000 in April 1991), with the highest mortality among the old and weak.
Shorelines are inherently dynamic, responding to short and long-term variability and trends in sea level, wave energy, sediment supply, and other forcing.
Land that is subject to flooding which is at least 15% of the Bangladesh land area is disproportionately occupied by people living a marginal existence with few options or resources for adaptation.
The IPCC have found very few studies that indicate benefits of climate change and sea-level rise in coastal and marine systems.
The video below shows the impacts of sea level rise on coastal communities in Orissa, India.
The poor village literally got sucked into the rising ocean.
The sea used to be a half days walk away, now it has claimed their village.
The term 'climate refugee' is one we will hear a lot more of, although as noted in the opening paragraph it more appropriate to refer to climatically displaced people as 'environmental migrants'.
Frank Biermann, a professor at Vrije University's Institute for Environmental Studies in Amsterdam.
Says, "The system is moving further away from meeting the needs, and the countries that are becoming more restrictive (on migration) are those who are largely responsible for global warming.
"
Some measures that could help vulnerable people adapt to climate change were on the agenda at the December 2007 meeting in Bali, Indonesia.
It was agreed at this meeting to launch a UN fund to help poor nations cope with the impact of global warming.

Opening Session: The University, Scientific Research, and Climate Change
This panel will highlight the mutual vulnerability of China and the U.S. to climate change, and the indispensable role of scientific research in understanding the problem and developing solutions.
What's at Risk?
Climate Model Predictions and Physical and Biological Impacts
This panel of climate scientists will describe the state of scientific knowledge regarding changes in the global climate system, the role of humans in causing these changes, and the likely impacts on earth's ecosystems.
This panel of ecologists, economists, and insurers will examine the economic and social risks of climate change, the vast differences in the vulnerability of different nations and social groups to those risks, and the scale of investment needed to adapt to climate change as its impacts increase.
This panel will address the strategic and ethical issues that underlie the international climate policy debate, and the implications of prioritizing the right of poor countries to economic development.
Speakers from oil, high-technology, and venture capital firms will discuss the ways in which businesses perceive and respond to the climate challenge, and how government policy and market signals must interact to provide the enormous investment in clean energy required in the decades ahead, especially in developing countries such as China.
The Media, Public Information, and Climate Change
This panel will discuss the challenges facing scientists, politicians and the media in communicating to the public the complex facts about the climate crisis, and facilitating a national discussion about the problem and its solutions.
This final session will highlight some key messages from the conference and the prospects for continuing collaboration on climate change research between U.C.
Berkeley and other stakeholders in China and the U.S.
The rush to protect forests as a way to tackle global warming could see billions of pounds handed over to corrupt politicians, criminals and polluting industries, experts have warned.
Deforestation causes about a fifth of man-made greenhouse gas emissions, and how to protect the huge stocks of carbon locked in tropical forests has become a key issue in the climate change debate.
Sir Nicholas Stern, in his 2006 review of the economics of the problem, said that £2.5bn a year could be enough to prevent deforestation across the eight most important countries.
Britain and Norway have already pledged £108m to a fund to protect forests in the Congo basin.
Rich countries paying tropical regions to protect forests is likely to form part of a new global climate deal to replace the Kyoto protocol, which could be agreed next year.
White added: "These forests are often in lawless regions with a history of conflict.
We have huge concerns about sending all this money in the name of fighting climate change if the land rights for people living there are not resolved.
It could cause more violence, benefit only a wealthy elite and lead to even greater carbon emissions.
"We think it would be a terrible mistake to reduce development funding purely to carbon and mitigating climate change.
This poses a real dilemma for governments of conscience like the UK.
They risk undermining all of their development and human rights work in this area if efforts to protect carbon don't support and strengthen community land rights and organisations.
"
Gareth Thomas, green minister at the Department for International Development, said: "We don't spend money on any project if we can't be certain that the money is going to go where it is needed.
But we have to step up work on land-use management, ownership issues and improving governance.
We have made quite a lot of progress, but it is not realistic that we can sort out every land use issue by the time of the next climate treaty.
"
James Heneage, the director of the Prince's Rainforests Project, a group set up by the Prince of Wales to work out a mechanism to fund forest protection, said a focus on land rights risked delaying efforts to protect the climate.
He said: "The issue of land rights is important and must be looked at, but it is also an intractable problem and will take time to solve.
We are in a state of emergency with climate change and we cannot allow the issue of land rights to delay getting serious amounts of money into forests to stop deforestation.

Two-thirds of the world's polar bears will be gone by the middle of the century, says a US government agency.
The US Geological Survey (USGS) says parts of the Arctic are losing summer ice so fast that no bears will be able to live there within several decades
The number of people made homeless by flooding in north-east India and Bangladesh has risen to some 1.5 million, officials say.
India's Assam state is suffering its third wave of floods this year, caused by heavy rains over the past four days.
The army has evacuated 800,000 people as the Brahmaputra rive and its tributaries flow at danger levels.
Downstream in Bangladesh, officials say half a million people are affected and many have been moved to safer places
The British Broadcasting Corporation reported on Saturday that not a single country in West, Central and East Africa has been unaffected by the torrential rain.
There are also been reports of flood-related deaths or homeless people in Burkina Faso, Togo and Ghana, as well as Ethiopia, Niger, Nigeria, Liberia, Chad, Senegal, Kenya and Mali
Flooding from torrential rain has devastated large areas of northern Ghana, and left thousands of people vulnerable to waterborne diseases.
At least 20 people have died in the floods, which have submerged land which produces food for the entire country.
Almost 400,000 people have lost their homes, a spokeswoman from the Ghana Red Cross told the BBC.
Parts of northern Togo have also been affected and 34,000 people have been displaced there, the government says.
At least 20 Togolese have also been killed, while 101 bridges and 46 schools have been destroyed.
While the Canadian and Australian prime ministers touted weekend discussions on climate change with their fellow Pacific Rim partners as an unprecedented success, several developing countries suggested yesterday that the wealthy nations around the table tried to bully them into endorsing a declaration that could undermine the international Kyoto Protocol
Heavy rain has been falling in Texas after Hurricane Humberto, the first hurricane to hit the US Gulf coast in two years, came ashore on Thursday.
One person was reported to have been killed and there were fears of flash flooding in areas already inundated in the wettest summer in 100 years.
Power was knocked out in some districts by Humberto's 85mph (140km/h) winds
Wheat prices have surged to a record, breaking through the $9 a bushel mark for the first time, fanning fears that the cost of bread will also increase.
Prices have been driven higher because droughts in key crop regions including Australia have led to smaller harvests
During the opening of a two-day international environment conference in Berlin, developing and industrialized nations remained far apart on who should shoulder responsibility for cutting greenhouse gas emissions.
Hosting the conference, being held under the auspices of the Gleneagles Dialogue -- a post-Kyoto round of debate on climate protection, German Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel emphasized the need to accelerate the marketing and spread of climate-friendly technologies.
Gabriel said the United Nations Climate Conference being held in Bali in December should provide the "starting signal" for comprehensive talks on a new climate agreement for the period after 2012, when the Kyoto Protocol runs out.
This had to contain a long-term goal, ambitious and obligatory commitments from the industrialized world, and fair contributions from the larger developing countries, he said.
Are the United Nations and the United States trying to outdo each other by hosting two parallel summit meetings on the same subject - climate change - during the same week at the end of September?
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is hosting a high-level meeting of world leaders on Sep. 24 in New York, while U.S. President George W. Bush has invited 20 of "the world's largest polluting countries" to a summit in Washington Sep. 27-28.
The United Nations has approved a 10-year strategic plan to tackle desertification, but has failed to reach an accord on the budget.
The meeting of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification has ended in Madrid and is expected to move on to New York to try to sort out funding.
The UN says desertification caused by climate change and unsuitable farming is a crisis of global proportions.
There should be no doubt that global warming is the most compelling issue of our time.
If unchecked, it will threaten our national security, stress our economy and degrade our quality of life in so many ways.
Our willingness to confront this unprecedented heating of the planet is a test of our moral obligation to our children and their children.
Governors want to expand state regulation of greenhouse gases in hopes of increasing pressure for federal action on global warming, the chairman of the National Governors Association said Wednesday.
Gov. Tim Pawlenty, R-Minn., said in an Associated Press interview that getting more states to limit greenhouse gases is a priority among clean energy issues for the group.
Others include spurring energy conservation and broadening use of renewable fuels such as ethanol.
We might have been forced to listen to nearly two years of the manure of political rhetoric to reach this point, but if the last few weeks are anything to go by the UK could soon see the green shoots of serious political action on climate change.
Plans for the world's first personal carbon trading scheme, in which people buy and sell their rights to produce pollution, are unveiled today.
The Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures & Commerce (RSA) is piloting a project later this year to test whether personal carbon trading could work on a large scale
A stamp duty rebate for home-buyers who improve domestic energy efficiency is to be proposed by the Conservatives' Quality of Life policy group this week.
It also proposes council tax and VAT cuts - and capping the energy use of appliances like TVs and fridges.
As details of Thursdays report emerged, leader David Cameron said he would put up green taxes "and use the proceeds to reduce taxes elsewhere".
Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, speaking today at the close of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Sydney, said, "I'm also very pleased that the Sydney Declaration mirrors the Canadian climate change approach on many levels.

The federal New Democrats plan to embarrass the Tories by reintroducing the clean-air and climate-change legislation that died in the last Parliament.
NDP environment critic Nathan Cullen said he will table a private-member's bill soon after federal politicians return to the Commons in October.
The original government legislation, Bill C-30, was rewritten by the three opposition parties in a special committee last winter.
Their goal was to force the government to live up to the provisions of the Kyoto Accord.
The bill would impose tougher targets on large industrial polluters, such as the oilsands sector in Alberta, in a way that would translate into higher financial penalties.
But Prime Minister Stephen Harper killed the bill when he announced his intention to shut down Parliament and start a new session with a throne speech.
Despite the growing political commitment to tackling global warming, individual energy use and carbon emissions in the leading industrial countries have actually increased in recent years, the new head of a major energy advisory group said Monday.
Nobuo Tanaka, the first non-European chosen to lead the International Energy Agency, said during an interview that Europe, Canada, Australia and particularly the United States had to do much more to increase energy efficiency if they wanted to have any credibility when calling on India and China to act
The IPCC Report on Coastal Systems and Low-Lying Areas projects exposure to increasing risks, including coastal erosion, due to climate change and sea-level rise.
The effect will be exacerbated by increasing human-induced pressures on coastal areas, creating many climate refugess.
Many millions more people are projected to be flooded every year due to sea-level rise by the 2080s.
Those densely-populated and low-lying areas where adaptive capacity is relatively low, and which already face other challenges such as tropical storms or local coastal subsidence, are especially at risk.
The numbers affected will be largest in the mega-deltas of Asia and Africa while small islands are especially vulnerable, e.g.
Tuvalu and Carteret Atoll.
The IPCC Report on Coastal Systems maintains that adaptation for coastal systems will be more challenging in developing countries than developed countries due to constraints on adaptive capacity.
Industry, Settlement and Society Costs and benefits of climate change for industry, settlement, and society will vary widely by location and scale.
In the aggregate, however, net effects will tend to be more negative the larger the change in climate.
The most vulnerable industries, settlements and societies are generally those in coastal and river flood plains, those whose economies are closely linked with climate-sensitive resources, and those in areas prone to extreme weather events, especially where rapid urbanisation is occurring.
Poor communities can be especially vulnerable, in particular those concentrated in high-risk areas.
They tend to have more limited adaptive capacities, and are more dependent on climate-sensitive resources such as local water and food supplies.
Where extreme weather events become more intense and/or more frequent, the economic and social costs of those events will increase, and these increases will be substantial in the areas most directly affected.
Climate change impacts spread from directly impacted areas and sectors to other areas and sectors through extensive and complex linkages.
Police at Stansted airport have arrested 57 people this morning after climate change protesters broke into a secure area and shut down flights.
A police spokeswoman said 50 people were arrested for aggravated trespass, three for trying to enter a restricted area and four on conspiracy to commit a public nuisance.
"Being arrested is a terrifying prospect, but not nearly as terrifying as the threat of climate change," she said.
In a statement, Plane Stupid said the disruption to flights would prevent "the release of thousands of tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere".
The Society of British Aerospace Companies criticised the action.
A spokesman, Matthew Knowles, said: "These protesters are ignoring the reality around aviation and climate change.
Flight numbers have increased at Stansted but noise nuisance around the airport has actually decreased and aircraft are 70% more fuel efficient than they were 50 years ago.
"There is a great deal of anger at the impact these plans will have on the global climate and on local people's quality of life.
"
Last month another organisation, Stop Stansted Expansion (SSE), launched a high court appeal against the building of a second runway at the Essex airport.
SSE said the government was disregarding the implications for climate change and noise.
Arctic ice is thinner than ever according to new evidence from explorers
Sea ice in the North Pole is even thinner than had been feared, according to results from the first ever expedition on foot to find out the affects of climate change on the Arctic.
Catlin Arctic Survey: Pen Hadow drilling to measure ice thickness Photo: BARCROFT
In the first half of a 620 mile journey to the Pole, the Catlin Arctic Survey led by Pen Hadow has reported that ice formed within the past year had an average thickness of 1.77m.
A lack of thicker ice suggests that ice formed more than a year ago has either moved to a different part of the ocean or melted away meaning the ice cover will be even further reduced this summer.
The findings come as Nasa warned that sea ice cover over the Arctic reached its lowest volume since records began this year, with the possibility of an ice-free summer as early as 2013.
The four-man expedition are trekking to the North Pole over 100 days in order to calibrate the satellite observations of the shrinking ice cap with evidence from the ground.
Forty-seven days into the trek, the British team have spotted their first Polar bear tracks and evidence of an Arctic fox and are able to trek for longer because of more hours of daylight.
As a consequence the team is having to rely on the relatively "old fashioned" ice drill to do the scientific monitoring.
Mr Hadow spends up to four hours every day drilling through the ice at up to ten sites and then taking measurements of the thickness of the ice and snow, salinity and other critical information.
So far the thickest measurements has been 3.75 metres but most are around half that.
First year ice is generally thinner than 2 metres and older multiyear ice is generally thicker than 3 metres.
Mr Hadow, who was the first man to trek solo to the Pole, said he was surprised to find such thin ice at this stage in the trek.
He explained that the route had been chosen, in conjunction with scientific advisers, to cover an area where there would be thicker ice.
Speaking on satellite phone from the team's latest floating camp out on the ice, he said: "To discover that there's virtually no multiyear in this part of the journey is a real surprise to me.
I am really interested to know what the scientists make of it.
"
The result of the expedition will be fed to scientists in time for a UN meeting in December where the world will decide a new agreement to tackle climate change.
Threat to European biodiversity 'as serious as climate change'
Most of Europe's species and habitats are in poor condition and the risk of extinction continues to rise, environment chiefs are to warn at a major biodiversity conference in Athens this week
The natural world across Europe is suffering a crisis as serious as the threat of climate change, Europe's environment chiefs are to warn this week.
Species at risk in the UK range from insects like the honeybee and swallowtail butterfly, to mammals and birds at the top of the food chain such as the otter and the golden eagle, said the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH).
The losses threaten to undermine vital ecosystem services like clean water and fertile soils, which underpin both quality of life and the economy, said Jacqueline McGlade, the EEA's executive director.
"Much of our economy in Europe relies on the fact we have natural resources underpinning everything," McGlade told the Guardian.
The losses of wildlife and habitat are a threat to being able to live sustainably within the enviroment in the future, she said.
"Some of the losses are irreversible.
"
McGlade will present findings from the agency report at a major conference next week called by the European environment commissioner Stavros Dimas.
He is worried that the European commission has failed to meet a pledge to halt biodiversity loss by 2010, and recently warned "the loss of biodiversity is a global threat that is every bit as serious as climate change".
"The reasons that we are losing biodiversity are well known: destruction of habitats, pollution, over-exploitation, invasive species and, most recently, climate change," Dimas will tell the conference in Athens.
"The compound effect of these forces is terrifying.
"
At another high-level conference in London on Wednesday, organised by the CEH, leaders from business, government, academics and NGOs will warn that ecosystems underpin human lifestyles from air, water and food to resources for industry.
Populations of some European common birds stopped falling in the 1990s, but all groups of birds had fallen in numbers since 1980, and other species groups like butterflies, amphibians and pollinating insects had declined dramatically, said the report.
"Ecosystems generally show a fair amount of resilience," it adds.
"Beyond certain thresholds, however, ecosystems may collapse and transform into distinctly different states, potentially with considerable impacts on humans.
"
Reforms to be put to the conference in Athens include better management of protected areas, which now make up more than 17% of the European Union territory; targets for economic sectors, such as transport, to ensure they do not have a negative impact on the environment; and more work on putting a "value" on ecosystem services so conservationists can argue their case against developers, said McGlade.
Globally, last year's annual "red list" of endangered species from the IUCN conservation organisation warned that the world's mammals face an extinction crisis, with almost one in four of 5,487 known species at risk of disappearing forever.
The media laps up fake controversy over climate change
Proof of paid-for climate denial at the Global Climate Coalition comes as no surprise, but it is no less depressing for that
There are three kinds of climate change denier .
There are those who simply don't want to accept the evidence, because it is too much to bear, or because it threatens aspects of their lives that they don't want to change.
These are by far the most numerous, and account for most of those whose comments will follow this post.
I have some sympathy for their position.
Denial is most people's first response to something they don't want to hear, whether it is a diagnosis of terminal illness or the threat presented by the rise of the Axis Powers.
The moral, intellectual and practical challenge of climate change is unprecedented.
The urge to duck it almost irresistible.
The third category consists of those who are paid to deny that climate change is happening.
Patrick Michaels and Steve Milloy , whose work for fossil fuel companies has been repeatedly exposed, are good examples.
There are probably a few paid stooges contributing to the Guardian's discussion threads as well.
Whenever you challenge anyone in categories two or three, they come over all innocent, claiming that the science is unsettled, that the other side are all liars, and all they are doing is telling the public what it needs to hear.
Anyone who has taken the trouble to read the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change or who subscribes to Science or Nature knows that they cannot possibly believe this, or are able to believe it only by tying their minds into such elaborate knots that they have succeeded in deceiving themselves.
We knew it, but we couldn't prove it.
But now we have a smoking gun.
Last week the New York Times revealed that the Global Climate Coalition, the industry-funded body that led the campaign to persuade people that manmade climate wasn't happening, knew all along that it was.
In 1995 its own experts warned that:
The scientific basis for the Greenhouse Effect and the potential impact of human emissions of greenhouse gases such as CO2 on climate is well established and cannot be denied … The contrarian theories raise interesting questions about our total understanding of climate processes, but they do not offer convincing arguments against the conventional model of greenhouse gas emission-induced climate change
David Bookbinder, the Sierra Club's chief climate counsel, said it was notable that three of the parties in the case -- the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, General Motors and Chrysler -- had earlier dropped one of their legal claims that would have compelled them to hand over documents related to climate change science.
Another party, the Association of International Automobile Manufacturers, turned over the primer.
Well I guess that when you are in trouble, and losing the argument, best go on the attack.
I didnt see any evidence put forward in this article to support the notion of serious man induced climate change, just a dissing of the growing number of people who have the temerity to doubt what they are told by the establishment.
And it was quite hilarious to hear the BBC, one of the main media cheerleaders for the notion of man induced climate change, now put in the camp or climate change deniers.
Whatever the politics of it, the serious question about Climate Change should all come down to science.
In Science, you can propose a theory, and its veracity is tested by measurement and experimentation.
No more melting of the Ice at the North Pole other than the seasonal melt and freeze.
I was appalled when I discovered a close relative had believed The Great Global Warming Swindle that C4 put out.
That was dangerous stuff.
Combine that with 18 months
Tell him if he doesn't use the huge influence The Guardian weans to bring correct facts to the fore then he probably won't see life into his 80s and he can forget about working his way through his Beethoven sonatas or Chopin etudes.
Forget it.
HIs piano will be floating on the flood down the high street, or he will be too ill with some appalling tropical disease with the breakdown of sanitation killing hundreds daily, to even want to play his piano.
Everything is going to change, George, as you know.
Can't people understand this?
George, there is a forth category, the climate realists.
Answer this – Why should I believe science when the whole history of climate change is littered with guesswork, scaremongering and downright lies?
From the 1970 Earth Day: The world has been chilling sharply for about twenty years.
If present trends continue, the world will be about four degrees colder for the global mean temperature in 1990, but eleven degrees colder in the year 2000.
This is about twice what it would take to put us into an ice age - Kenneth Watt
When people and organisations that advocate the dangers of climate change start to act responsibly themselves I might start to listen.
The next time they decide to have a grand conference perhaps they could use the phone rather than jetting in from all over the World, a form of transport that has been reported as terrible.
Care to reveal just how many miles Al Gore has flown in a plane all in the name of saving the planet?
The BBC are near obsessed with climate change.
Hardly a news bulletin passes by without an evocative image of a stranded polar bear floating on a glacier
Science clearly confirms that climate change deniers are pinheads.
Due to the large surface area to volume ratio of their craniums they continue to lose heat more quickly than other mere mortals and remain unaffected by global warming.
The fact is that climate change is just ONE of the factors that will soon force a change in lifestyles and reduction in global population.
The general collapse in global ecosystems because of deforestation, overgrazing and general over-exploitation of our finite planet due to overpopulation and an unsustainable voracious economic system based on never-ending economic growth should be far ahead on the ecological agenda than climate change.
Like other warmists you rely upon the findings of the IPCC as evidence.
It would seem to me that if you create a government organisation that's continued existance relies upon furthering propoganda about manmade global warming, it should not be suprising that this is exactly what it does.
You will be aware that the alarmist nature of its reports have been criticised by BOTH sides in the debate.
impact on climate is based on well-established scientific fact, and should not be
timing or impact of climate change as a result of the increase in greenhouse gas
Good stuff as always George.
Anyone who spends time in the countryside knows the climate is warming, and has been since the mid '70's at least.
However, I don't like the term 'climate change denier', redolent as it is of the term 'holocaust denier'.
It's not good to even indirectly compare global warming sceptics with fascists.
Rathga - since when is the IPCC a governmental body?
and what about the thousands of other papers relating to climate change that support the IPCC or show its estimates to be conservative?

I think the key phrase here is 'if present trends continue'.
You know as well as anyone that cooling trends did not continue as the cooling effect of particulate pollution was overwhelmed by the warming effect of a massive increase of greenhouse gases.
I know it is hard for some people to get their head around but man-made pollution can have both cooling (as in the case of particulate pollution) and warming effects (greenhouse gas emissions) at the same time.
It is well understood that the warming effect of man-made atmospheric pollution is in the ascendency.
The fact that scientists observed a temporary cooling effect in the 1970s from particulate pollution does not in anyway upset the current conclusions of climate scientists.
I ask therefore what your point is?
I get a bit bored of answering just plain silly denialist points, so I want to ask the denialists to explain away some recent peer-reviewed and not clearly alarmist projections on climate change, bur rather the best scientific estimates:
Notice that these papers some of the 30 000 that have been published on climate change since the 2007 IPCC report.
IPCC 2007 now appears rather conservative relative to the mainstream science being produced.
On the ice, you are so wrong as to be a liar.
The decrease in arctic sea ice is statistically significant - ie it is greater than natural variations from year-to-year.
The increase in Antarctic sea-ice is not statistically significant.
You have reversed the two positions to fit the answer you want.
I claim NSIDC in my support - who do you have?
However, I don't like the term 'climate change denier', redolent as it is of the term 'holocaust denier'.
It's not good to even indirectly compare global warming sceptics with fascists
George is in danger of exactly this if he thinks that there are only the three categories of "denier" he lists.
In my limited experience I know those categories exist but don't personally know anyone from them.
Most people I know who are "deniers" are either people with enough scientific training to, rightly or wrongly, decide that the alarmists arguments don't add up or people who have heard it all before about the Ice age, SARS the millennium bug, Avian flu etc and can't remember when winters were last so cold.
There is a 4th group, really two groups, but they cannot be distinguished so they have to be lumped into the same category: pathological liars and the spectacularly misinformed.
At least one of them has posted here today, for example, the person making the ludicrous claim that Antarctic ice is increasing.
No more melting of the Ice at the North Pole other than the seasonal melt and freeze.

By the way, rathga linked to an outraged letter from Monckton about the interpretation of the GCC documents (where they admit that global warming is a fact which cannot be really argued against, only made confusing for those trying to discover the facts); but everyone should have a look at the originals because not only do they admit the truth about AGW but they also look at contrarian theories and show how none of them have the slightest basis in reality :
The contrarian theories raise interesting questions about our total understanding of climate processes, but they do not offer convincing arguments against the conventional model of greenhouse gas emission-induced climate change.
Jastrow's hypothesis about the role of solar variability and Michaels' questions about the temperature record are not convincing arguments against any conclusion that we are currently experiencing warming as the result of greenhouse gas emissions.
However, neither solar variability nor anomalies in the temperature record offer a mechanism for off-setting the much larger rise in temperature which might occur if the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases were to double or quadruple.
Lindzen's hypothesis that any warming would create more rain which would cool and dry the upper troposphere did offer a mechanism for balancing the effect of increased greenhouse gases.
However, the data supporting this hypothesis is weak, and even Lindzen has stopped presenting it as an alternative to the conventional model of climate change.

A recent survey of arctic ice thickness shows it to be 4 metres thick.
This is not the jokers using linen tapes to measure who presently on the Ice.
Arctic Ice has grown 1 million square kilometres in two years?
But it shouldn't be there?
You keep your Royal Flush of so called climate change Deniers and add to it the busted flush which is the Theory that CO2 emissions will cause dangerous levels of Global Warming.
They've put all their documents on climate change up for possible inspection.
They created that open-ended risk for themselves.
There is a climate of fear prevailing over environmental matters and one can discern that in your post.
You should really relax because we are not all doomed, only two years ago NSIDC predicted all the arctic ice would be gone by September and it never happened.
Last year the Wilkins Ice shelf was supposed to be in danger of imminent collapse and guess what they used the same photo's from last year to say it was due to collapse, its still there?

Do they know that the urban myth about the 'coming ice age' is...an urban myth ?
Do you ?
If not, perhaps you can provide some evidence about who was saying that there was an ice age coming ?

Normally I would argue against the need for this, but I find these endless battles in the comments with those who are clearly mischievously spreading misinformation to be completely counterproductive.
Someone said "we are winning the battle" against them - I disagree with that.
Almost every article about climate issues in the Guardian online is followed by diversionary stalemate arguments about whether global warming is anthropogenic.
We urgently need to move past this towards discussing the details of solutions to our predicament.
Those with a casual interest in the subject no doubt come away feeling that the "man-made global warming" argument is not settled.
This retards progress.
In the previous column, I stated that I am a left critic of the positions of global warming advocates.
As for your three categories - 1) I am not a denier - I acknowledge that some warming has taken place, but the extent and potential impacts are overstated.
2) I am not a retired male who does the talk circuit.
3) I am certainly not in anyone's pay - a look at my bottom line would confirm that.
I find it repulsive that, well into the 21st century, there has been little to no effort to redress the massive world inequalities.
FOr whatever reasons, the developed world has always found something more pressing to demand its time and resources - whether the Cold War, dot-com speculation, or Global Warming.
Despite all the protestation of concern for all the future deaths due to global warming, there are millions of CURRENT deaths taking place because of a lack of the basics of human survival - food, water, shelter, medical care.
Every generation must have its looming catastrophe - from Revelation to Nuclear Armageddon to Global Warming - an eschatalogical worldview seems inherent in human societies.
As for AGW, the science is error-prone, the modeling is inept, and the policy implications are ludicrous.
A truly progressive and environmental response to excessive human use of fuels would aim at economic and environmental justice simultaneously.
Rather than replacing coal with nuclear, we would seek improved housing and community design.
Rather than creating massive wind farms with crushing capital requirements, we would implement small-scale wind and solar that is community based.
Nope, the current climate of Global Warming advocates is anything but progressive.
It is reactionary in the extreme.
Anyone seen the news from the Catlin expedition?
They're hunkered down on the ice waiting to be rescued having failed to get any meaningful data since theri equipment failed due to the intense cold.
Looking on the IARC-JAXA data, I see that the Arctic ice extent has been at an all-time record high extent (since the satellite started in 2002) for the last three weeks now.
And it's thick.
Though Catlin has failed in their attempt to pretend the ice was melting, a German research team have just flown an airborn radar set across the Arctic, perfectly safely, and report that the ice is twice as thick as expected.
Here is a (translated) link: http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.radiobremen.de%2Fwissen%2Fnachrichten%2Fwissenawipolararktis100.html&sl=de&tl=en&history_state0=

Here is a (translated) link:
The claims made in that article on the Radio Bremen website is not corroborated, it doesn't name any scientist and it's not on the Alfred Wegener Institute's website.
Also the fact that the ice has been at its thickest in the past three weeks means nothing in itself.
We'll have to wait and see for the data to be published.
What's more, that survey was a four-week survey of a limited area of the Arctic.
The long-term trends are clear and year-on-year variability changes nothing there.
Both Nasa and the National Snow and Ice Data Center show long-term trends in ice thinning and shrinking.
Your solutions to man made climate change may well cause immense damage to the poorer nations.
Curbs on international travel and trade.
How do you tell the Chinese and Indians to call a halt to their Industrial Revolution.
Many of the people who are not certain about man made climate change care deeply about the environment - the name calling and putting people in little conspiracy boxes demeans your argument.
Make your case through reasoned argument not by deriding your opponents.
If you are wrong many of the changes you propose will make many people all over the world poorer.
To improve the economies of developing countries we need to encourage more trade, more travel, more airports, more roads, improved infrastructure - all things I presume the man made climate changers would oppose?
When making your arguments many of you ignore the influence of other contributors to climate change.
The NASA site, whilst noting the likely contribution of CO2 and greenhouse gases to climate change also makes much of other contributing factors.
This balance is not reflected in many who contribute to this debate.
Starting with a little 500,000 sq km boo-boo in measuring the Arctic ice this past winter.
The National Snow and Ice Data Center showed a dramatic loss of ice in February - including 1/4 of Hudson Bay.
I called Environment Canada and aksed whether there had been any such catastrophic event - and, if so, why it hadn't been in the news seeing how ice breakup in the Hudson in February would certainly be news.
It was bloggers who alerted the NSIDC to its errors - not the highly-paid researchers who should have smelled skunk right from the outset.
I fear that their own prejudices made them unwilling to challenge the data.
"On February 18, we reported that the F15 sensor malfunction started out having a negligible impact on computed ice extent, which gradually increased as the sensor degraded further.
At the end of January, the F15 sensor underestimated ice extent by 50,000 square kilometers (19,300 square miles) compared to F13.
That is still within the margin of error for daily data.
By mid-February, the difference had grown to 500,000 square kilometers (193,000 square miles), which is outside of expected error.
"

I don't know about majority (one poll in the Observer last year said 40% of Brits), but it's certainly a high percentage who do not think that global warming is real - and they cannot be dismissed.
The die-hard ones will never be convinced, but for many of those others, the positions aren't as polarised as debates on CiF suggest and we need to become more inclusive, not automatically forcing someone into the opposite camp because their use of the term skeptic is like a red rag to a bull, after all, only deniers use the term skeptic!
We need more neutral language - I used the term 'realist' above because I'm scratching my head wondering what to call us 'warmies' (greenie pinko commie trotskyite doesn't quite cover it, I feel :) ) Most people are shades of grey, not black and white.
........at least one of them has posted here today, for example, the person making the ludicrous claim that Antarctic ice is increasing
You're right in that Arborist - the CEOs of energy companies can make a killing by denying that climate change is real.
There is a reason why global warming is considered a liberal issue and as such makes many hardcore conservatives run for the hills.
Children of liberal parents are usually taught to put truthfulness before self interest, whereas children of conservative parents are usually taught that it is okay, maybe even necessary, to often do the opposite.
It is because liberals are in the habit of being comfortable with expressing painful truths, and conservatives are not, that we see so much resistance to the idea of man made climate change from so many conservatives and moneyed elites.
They are used to putting their own self interests before truthfulness whenever there seems to be a contest between the two, and as such they project this tendency, to put their own agendas ahead of reality, onto liberals also.
In other words hardcore conservatives think climate change campaigners are simple out for themselves, because isnt that what ‘everyone does.
I say we should just calmly and consistently contradict the nonsense spouted out by climate change deniers, just as one would with holocaust or evolution deniers.
We shouldnt get rattled, or let them off the hook because we have no stomach for a fight.
Their overall argument and position is a silly and poisonous one, and we should always make an effort to remember this.
Also, and I think this is the key to it all, moneyed elites stand to make a killing both literally and metaphorically as things get worse around the world.
Climate change is going to create scarcity and a lot of demand for shrinking resources.
This in turn will mean rising prices as the availability of basic commodities goes down.
Some people will not only become rich beyond their wildest dreams, but will hold the poor subserviently in their pockets like never before in history.
Fresh drinking water in particular is going to be a key issue.
Unfortunately global warming shouldnt be, but is, a political issue, especially in America.
And it all boils down to, do you actually care about other people or not?

A breaking ice shelf in Antarctica ... many scientists fear the world is close to a tipping point.
Jim Elliott/British Antarctic Survey/AP
Sea level rise due to global warming will "substantially exceed" official UN projections and could top 150cm by the end of the century, according to a report from the US Geological Survey on the risks of abrupt climate change .
Such a rise would be catastrophic, seeing hundreds of millions of people affected by flooding.
Many scientists now fear the warming world is on the verge of "tipping points", in which climate change and its effects accelerate rapidly.
The science is evolving quickly and the new report updates the most recent findings of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which was released in 2007.
On sea level, the report found models used by the IPCC in 2007 do not take into account recent information on how fast glaciers slide into the oceans, particularly from Greenland and the West Antarctic ice sheets.
The report says the south western states of the US will enter a "permanent drought state".
But the risk of the ocean circulation in the Altantic shutting down – freezing the coasts of America and Europe, as in the film The Day After Tomorrow – is rated as low by the report.
It predicts a slowdown of around 25% to 30%.
The chance of a catastrophic release of methane from frozen sub-sea stores at high latitudes is also rated low.
The report is part of a series by the US Climate Change Science Program, which collates all US federal research on the subject.
It was presented tonight at the American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco.
The IPCC predicted that sea level would rise by 28cm to 42cm by the end of the century.
,The authors cite a 2007 study by Prof Stephan Rahmstof at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Change Research which predicted a sea level rise of between 40cm-150cm by 2100.
But even this much higher estimate will "likely need to be revised upwards" because it does not fully capture the ice flow processes.
Goce will map the Earth's gravitational field with unprecedented accuracy to reveal changes in ocean circulation and sea level caused by climate change
The polar ice caps are melting – but how much ice is left?
Three British explorers will set out on a three-month trip to measure this and will present their findings ahead of global climate change talks in December
The YouTube promotion for the convention bureau in Poznan, Poland, offers this invitation: “ You’e got an idea; we’ve got the place .” The idea, through two weeks of climate negotiations that ended Saturday, was to find new ways to craft a common, global approach to avoid overloading the atmosphere with greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels and forests.
So far, every such effort has faltered or proved a dead end — from the 1992 Framework Convention on Climate Change to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol .
Elisabeth Rosenthal , who covered the talks, sent in a final dispatch over the weekend once the last prolonged plenary session concluded.
Her note, posted below, illustrates the deep “ climate divide ” that persists.
On one side are the world’s industrialized nations, which largely built their wealth through a century of fossil-fuel combustion; on the other, those seeking a path out of poverty that, for the moment, has to depend on the same energy sources, and in many cases also on clearing forests.
Many experts on the talks see little likelihood of a full-blown, completed treaty a year from now in Copenhagen, in part because the incoming Obama administration must shape its approach around the concerns of the Senate (where a two-thirds vote must consent to United States treaty participation).
And Congress remains divided over climate steps not just by party, but by geography, with states rich in coal or clinging to industries reliant on oil most resistant to change.
President-elect Barack Obama plans to introduce his climate and energy team formally on Monday afternoon in Chicago.
The team includes both seasoned environmental regulators who see global warming mainly as a traditional pollution problem and Steven Chu, a Nobel laureate in physics who recognizes the need, along with a price on emissions, for big leaps in science and engineering.
Sustaining a focus on both aspects of the climate/energy challenge will not be easy.
POZNAN, Poland — Compared with last year’s climate negotiations – which ended with a representative from Papua New Guinea dramatically upbraiding the United States for its slow response – the talks here ended with a whimper.
The gathered nations, as had been anticipated, agreed on little more than a pledge to enter “full negotiating mode” to complete a new climate treaty within a year and a legal structure for a new global fund to help poor countries deal with the effects of changing climate patterns.
But moments later, that sense of triumph was followed by half an hour of passionate protests on the floor, after it was announced that separate negotiations had failed to increase sources of funding to support poor countries in their quest to limit impacts from a changing climate.
By 2050 or so, the world population is expected to reach nine billion, essentially adding two Chinas to the number of people alive today.
Those billions will be seeking food, water and other resources on a planet where, scientists say, humans are already shaping climate and the web of life.

As the world’s population comes to grips with climate change disasters, it will become necessary to apply selectivity to resource allocation.
Triage is applied in an emergency to allow the most globally beneficial use of inadequate resources.
There will be severe climate disruptions, which will be left untreated because they will be recognized as able to recover autonomously.
Selected climatically-induced emergencies where tax-payers’ money can reduce suffering will be funded.
Last, and most sadly, there may be even situations where unlimited funds cannot reverse impacts and the limited funds are deemed better deployed on other projects.
The Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change decided in December 2007 to launch a comprehensive process to enable the full, effective and sustained implementation of this Convention.
Among other actions, the Bali Roadmap states that Parties agree to “enhanced action on the provision of financial resources and investment to support action on mitigation and adaptation and technology cooperation.”
Discussions of responses to climate change, which to date have been focussed on mitigation (the reduction of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere) and adaptation (supporting communities to live in warmer and hydrologically more extreme climates), must now consider a fund/no fund response strategy.
This website is dedicated to discussion of climate change triage.
Today eminent climate scientists have told an Australian parliamentary inquiry that the Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions will not achieve even a "limited" level of protection against climate change and are "much weaker" than the cuts developed countries need to make.
The threat of global warming could be greatly diminished if nations cut emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases by 70% this century, according to a new analysis by scientists at the USA's National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).
While global temperatures would rise, the most dangerous potential aspects of climate change, including massive losses of Arctic sea ice and permafrost and significant sea level rise, could be partially avoided.
Penguins and scientists around the world have been watching the remaining ice bridge since last March, anticipating its collapse.
Now it has broken!
Why worry – well because the loss of an ice shelf can also allow the glaciers that feed into it to start flowing ice into the ocean at an accelerated rate, contributing to a rise in global sea levels.
The Wilkins Ice Shelf is located on the southwestern Antarctic Peninsula, the fastest-warming region of the Earth.
In the past 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by 2.5 degrees C.
I think PEOPLE are our greatest vulnerability because of the many difficulties intrinsic to just “engaging society”.
The disparity between the enormity of climate change and small individual actions has to be admitted and tackled directly.
In their excellent 2006 report “Warm Words” the Institute for Public Policy Research propose:
I notice a few people have posted about the Climate Change Congress in Copenhagen -- well here's my take on this impressive meeting.
SIX Key Messages from this Copenhagen Climate Congress as I heard them.
They are:
Danish Prime Minister (PM), Mr. Anders Fogh Rasmussen said last month at the science Climate Change Congress:"The longer we wait, the worse it gets.
At the UN climate conference in Bali in December 2007, a two-year roadmap was adopted.
Copenhagen is the target.
Some people and countries question whether it is realistic to agree to a global deal in nine months.
I say, we must.
Waiting a year or two will only make the decisions even tougher.
Just two years ago international climate scientists agreed on a forecast that sea levels would rise by around 50 centimetres by the end of this century.
Now scientists meeting ahead of global climate talks later this year believe that may be too conservative an estimate so says the ABC in Australia (Broadcast: 11/03/2009, reporter: Shane McLeod ).
Is this true?
Whose estimate of increasing ocean levels can we believe?
In some cases, greed may lead to a revision of how people think about climate change.
Eventually it must of course as more energy is put into the atmosphere and oceans causing more extreme weather conditions, more severe hurricanes, droughts and floods.
At some point in the decades to come, there will be an exodus inland.
Insurance companies will see to it.
Global warming could devastate European ski resorts within decades, forcing lower-altitude resorts to close and threatening winter sports which now attract up to 80 million tourists a year.
According to environmental journalist, Kelpie Wilson, ”At this moment in time, the nation most responsible for climate change is the least affected by the consequences.
Our cool weather is unfortunate, because it is prolonging the day of reckoning when Americans realize that we really do have to do something about climate change.”
This is the first of a series of commentaries about Greed and Global Warming.
Since many of you connected to, employed by or dependent upon campaign contributions from fossil fuel industries may not agree with some of the ideas that I will present, I am beginning with an apology of sorts.
The petroleum and coal products that you provide and the industries that donate to your election campaign are largely responsible.
Global warming is simply the result of too many people burning too much fossil fuel.
This is not hypothetical; we can measure the results.
According to Reuters (October 20, 2006), "Greenland's low coastal regions lost 155 gigatons (41 cubic miles) of ice each year between 2003 and 2005 from excess melting and icebergs…"
And we are already seeing the effects on plant and animal life.
At least 70 species of frogs, mostly mountain-dwellers that had nowhere to go to escape the creeping heat, have gone extinct because of climate change, the analysis says.
It also reports that between 100 and 200 other cold-dependent animal species, such as penguins and polar bears are in deep trouble.
In previous posts (see list on right), I have written about tipping points and positive feedback loops.
In summary, the more the polar regions warm now, the FASTER they will warm in the future because water absorbs more heat than ice and because the permafrost in the Arctic tundra, which locks in a vast carbon reservoir, is melting.
This is releasing more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere which leads to more warming—a positive feedback loop.
The debate is not whether global warming is occurring, or if it is caused by humans, but what we can do about it.
One thing we can do is to open our eyes to the reality that we are being routinely misled by multinational oil, gas and coal companies, power companies and automobile companies.
Although the CEOs and managers are good people, a corporation is a near-immortal entity that is designed for one purpose only: making money for its shareholders.
A corporation has no conscience, but it can act like it does for PR purposes.
"Further global warming of 1 °C defines a critical threshold.
Beyond that we will likely see changes that make Earth a different planet than the one we know.
"
Mr. Inhofe [R. OK, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works] has a track record for using his power in committee to block legislation designed to cut the greenhouse gas emissions contributing to climate change.
He famously said on one occasion that global warming was "the greatest hoax perpetrated on the American people".
During the Inhofe period in power, Congress has done little to curb the gas-guzzling SUVs (six miles a gallon), has flirted with the idea of drilling for oil in the Arctic and has allowed the Bush administration to put a wet blanket on to international efforts to fight global warming.
Right now we face double jeopardy.
Our reliance and dependence upon fossil fuels and the competition for dwindling reserves creates world tensions that will likely get worse as supplies diminish.
In addition, our combustion of fossil fuels is putting the biosphere at risk.
We can turn this around by switching to green, renewable energy.
Solar, wind and bio-fuels offer the promise of a peaceful, healthy home planet.
But time is running out and our government and corporate leadership need to take the lead in curbing emissions and plan how to mitigate the coming impacts of climate change.
Until then we are in an environmental and energy death spiral.
Comments are welcome.
The atmosphere near the surface of the Earth has warmed about 1 degree in the 20th century.
This doesn’t seem like much, after all walking from a shady spot to a sun drenched spot can reflect a change of several degrees.
So what’s the big deal?
How can one degree make such a difference?
The reason is that there a vast areas in the polar and mountain regions in which the ice is just barely above the freezing point.. Permafrost is found on both land and continental shelves in the Arctic, and it comprises almost 24% of the Northern Hemisphere’s land, covering approximately 22.8 million square kilometers.
Source
So it stands to reason that at the southern extremes of Siberia and Alaska that are warming the fastest are right at the tipping point.
A small amount of warming melts the ice.
The soil beneath the surface has been mostly frozen for about 10,000 years and over this period it has been accumulating partially decomposed plant and animal matter from the surface.
As the permafrost melts the organic material is broken down by microorganisms which release more CO2 which causes more warming.
“Professor Paul Crutzen, who won a Nobel Prize in 1995 for his work on the hole in the ozone layer, believes that political attempts to limit man-made greenhouse gases are so pitiful that a radical contingency plan is needed.” [Steve Conner of the UK Guardian, July 31, 2006]
Crutzen has suggested increasing the albedo of the planet by seeding the atmosphere with sulfate particles.
Other ideas like installing reflective films and increasing phytoplankton populations (that consume CO2) have also been proposed.
Ameliorate the impact of global warming by covering all parking structures, highways, office buildings, homes and condos with solar panels.
Fund research into the technology needed to seal off the lower stories of important buildings so that the upper stories can be occupied.
Think of L.A. as the new Venice complete with floating docks, water shuttles and water limos.
Develop food crops adapted to the newly opened habitat in the poles and start cultivation as the polar regions warm sufficiently for farming.
Develop floating desalination plants and pipelines to carry freshwater to the new developments in the new deserts forming in the interior.
In the July 16, 2006 edition of SCIENCE a research team in which Dr. Edward A. Schuur of the University of Florida participated, reported new findings about the reservoir of carbon stored in the permafrost in Siberia.
The researchers specifically addressed loess soil, known as ”yedoma” in Siberia, a wind and water born dust frozen in permafrost in depths up to 50 m (~164’).
The concentration of carbon in the deep yedoma deposits was much higher than expected compared to deep soils elsewhere.
Could you please explain how the mass of carbon is measured and estimated in the atmosphere and in the other pools?
DR. SCHUUR: Mass of carbon is the concentration times the volume.
In the case of yedoma, we need to know the thickness of the yedoma (av = 25m), the bulk density (weight of dry soil per volume of soil, in other words kg of soil per cubic meter) and then the carbon concentration, which we can measure on an elemental analyzer.
The elemental analyzer combusts the soil sample and measures the amount of carbon dioxide that is released upon combustion.
We take soil samples from a range of geographic locations and vertically throughout the yedoma to describe a large area.
A similar approach is used for ocean, atmosphere too.
DR. SCHUUR: There are two comparisons in our paper: the first comparison is between deep permafrost yedoma (~500gt) and the surface values that are typically used for northern ecosystems ~450gt.
The latter value is focused on 1m depth.
So, we are saying that there is another, more or less equivalent (large) amount stored deeper below.
The second comparison is an estimate carbon pools for >10,000 years ago when there were ice sheets at the last glacial maximum.
The first comparison is the most relevant for current and future changes.
The reason that yedoma is different is that the surface of the soil was rising because in the glacial/interglacial periods, dust was falling and accumulating on the surface.
Even though it was only mm to cm falling per year, over decades, this adds up to a lot of material, up to 53m (174’) thick in some places.
As the surface of the soil rose, carbon that was in the soil became trapped in permafrost (permanently frozen) before it had time to decompose fully.
As a result you can see intact plant roots preserved deep in the frozen soil.
This happened at a time where the ecosystem was steppe-tundra with lots of grasses and herbivores (think mammoth, bison, etc., other Pleistocene mega fauna)
SMO: In regions at the southern extreme of continuous permafrost, how fast is it melting and what CO2 contributions to the atmosphere is this making today?
SMO: If the melting is an accelerating positive feedback loop, can you make any estimates of how much faster the out gassing might be with a given temperature or atmospheric CO2 level increase?
DR. SCHUUR: Again this is the current and future research figuring out how much of a climate impact this pool will have using g/c/ms and future scenarios.
DR. SCHUUR: Permafrost stability (and preservation of carbon therein) is affected by climate change.
Currently, human-caused changes in atmospheric greenhouse gases are likely to affect global climate, thus anything that we can do to reduce emissions to the atmosphere will help mitigate this problem.
SMO: There is a school of thought which believes that permafrost melting will result in the tundra becoming a carbon sink rather than a carbon source.
The theory is that as the polar climate warms, plant communities currently limited by the cold temperatures will expand their range northward.
And since plants are carbon sinks, the net effect of carbon and methane release from the melting permafrost in the tundra will be cancelled.
DR. SCHUUR: Here's a comment regarding surprises in climate change research.
One aspect about this yedoma pool is that we are saying that this is 500 billion tons of carbon that was not really considered before.
One extension of this is to think that if this surprise is out there, might there not be other surprises in the earth carbon cycle/climate system that can have a significant impact on our climate trajectory?
This research makes me think that there are more surprises out there, and some we might only discover as they change in response to changing climate.
During this summer of searing heat waves, we don’t need to tell Americans that things are heating up.
In a report issued this June by the prestigious National Academy of Sciences, “A panel of top climate scientists told lawmakers that Earth is heating up and that "human activities are responsible for much of the recent warming.
Their 155-page report said average global surface temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere rose about 1 degree during the 20th century.-- Earth is the hottest it has been in at least 400 years, maybe more.”
In big brush strokes, the climate of our Earth has changed dramatically since it was formed.
Our planet had experienced hotter periods and colder periods.
The outcome is determined by the amount of solar energy input vs. the amount of solar energy reflected and heat radiated.
See our article on Earth’s Radiation Budget for how this balance is established..
Global warming is the observed increase in the average temperature of the Earth's atmosphere and oceans in recent decades.
The Earth's average near-surface atmospheric temperature rose 0.6 ± 0.2 °Celsius (1.1 ± 0.4 °Fahrenheit) in the 20th century.
The prevailing scientific opinion on climate change is that "most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities.
" Source
It is widely believed by many scientists that what seems to be a relatively small increase in sea temperature is negatively effecting coral reefs (coral bleaching) and is accentuating the severity of hurricanes.
But the impacts on high latitudes are just now starting to get attention.
What may be until now a largely overlooked consequence of global warming is the effect of rising temperatures in the Arctic and Antarctic.
As glaciers melt, sea level rises and a darker, more absorbent surface is exposed.
Likewise, as sea ice melts, it loses the reflectivity of frozen snow and ice, therefore the darker water surface absorbs more solar energy.
What is significant is that a half degree change in average global temperature may make us sweat a little (or a lot) more in the temperate climes, at the southern edge of the permafrost regions, there is frozen subsurface permafrost soil that is just barely above freezing.
In this case a half a degree means the difference between solid and liquid.
And this difference in phases is huge.
As the permafrost thaws it allows bacteria and other decomposers to get busy.
The outcome is the release of carbon dioxide and methane (10 times more effect than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas).
This is what scientists mean when they talk about “tipping points”—a small change can initiate large scale, irreversible changes.
What we have here is a positive feedback loop.
The end products of the reaction (thawing and the release of carbon dioxide) increase atmospheric warming which stimulates more permafrost thawing.
There is reason to believe that this may be an “accelerating” positive feedback loop in which the faster the permafrost melts, the faster the permafrost melts.
In California, the population in year 2003 totaled 36,363,502 individuals who owned 24 million registered cars and trucks.
Each day Californians drive 825 million miles.
This works out to 36 miles/day by the average driver and the combustion of 47 million gallons of fuel that generates 5.4 million pounds of pollutants daily.
"Transportation accounts for one third of all energy use and carbon emissions in the United States.
The sector is 97 percent dependent on petroleum; cars and trucks consume two-thirds of all of the petroleum used in the country.
In many urban areas, vehicles produce 50% or more of air pollution.”
Jeffrey Kluger in his April 3, 2006 cover story in Time Magazine clearly and succinctly sounds the alarm about the immediacy of global warming ( This link will take you to the article at Time’s website.

Polar Ice Caps Are Melting Faster Than Ever... More And More Land Is Being Devastated By Drought... Rising Waters Are Drowning Low-Lying Communities... By Any Measure, Earth Is At ... The Tipping Point
Foot draggers and non-believers have routinely dsimissed global warming as something for future generations to deal with, the impacts would not be felt for decades or centuries.
Kluger argues that we are already experiencing the impact of increased CO2 levels which are now at record levels now the hightest in 650,000 years.
“Never mind what you've heard about global warming as a slow-motion emergency that would take decades to play out.
Suddenly and unexpectedly, the crisis is upon us.”
…glaciers, it turns out, can move with surprising speed, and so can nature.
What few people reckoned on was that global climate systems are booby-trapped with tipping points and feedback loops, thresholds past which the slow creep of environmental decay gives way to sudden and self-perpetuating collapse.
He points out that Grennland ice is melting at a rate of 53 cubic miles per year, about 250 times the amount used by Los Angeles in a year.
That sounds awfully immediate to me.

Fishing and Climate Change: Millions of people around the world depend on fisheries and aquaculture, directly or indirectly, for their livelihoods.
During the past three decades, the number of fishers and aquaculturists has grown faster than the world’s population, and employment in the fisheries sector has grown faster than employment in traditional agriculture.
An international group of leading ecologists and economists have warned that worldwide fisheries could totally collapse by 2048 if no action is taken to halt current levels of overfishing.
In findings from an extensive global study published in the journal Science, they said that at current rates, fish stocks risked declining to an extent that would render commercial fishing impossible and recovery unlikely.
The four-year evaluation found that about one third of open sea fisheries have already collapsed, a trend exacerbated by the changes produced by broader losses in marine biodiversity.
The researchers pointed to fishing, pollution, climate change, increasing acidity of the ocean and the destruction of marine habitats as some of the key factors for the decline.
“An expected characteristic of global climate change is a likely increase in the variability of environmental conditions.
Experience already gained in dealing with longer term fluctuations in marine environments, such as those induced by El Niño events, emphasize the need for adaptability.
As well, ensuring sustainable economic levels of fishing capacity should be determined with the variability in mind.
The effects of climate change on fisheries will impact a sector that is already characterized by full utilization of resources, large overcapacity and conflicts among fishers, and others, vying for alternative uses of marine ecosystems.
Thus, climate change adds a further argument for developing effective and flexible fisheries management system in an ecosystem context.” FAO - The United Nations
Today, more people than ever depend on marine fisheries but the ocean’s ability to meet their needs is in grave danger.
Cultured fish now accounts for about a third of all fish consumed in the world, and the U.S. and other nations are looking for ways to reduce the amount of fish they import.
Yet in the U.S. and elsewhere, proposed aquaculture laws fail to set environmental standards or sustainable management tools for these marine based fish farms.
Too often, our world seems to careen from one crisis to the next: violence in the Middle East, disease in Africa, soaring food and fuel prices around the globe, the threat of climate change.
When people are buffeted by one shock after another, it's not uncommon for them to grow pessimistic, to see the world's problems as too intractable to solve.
The temptation is to throw up our hands, retreat from the world and tend our own gardens.
Yet from where I sit, on the 38th floor of the United Nations building, the view is rather different.
My perspective is of cautious but resolute optimism.
Every problem of the world finds its way to the U.N., our global crossroads of politics and diplomacy.
But if the problems come together at the U.N., so do the often hidden connections among them—and through those connections, the ways to real solutions.
Nowhere is that more apparent than in our approach to climate change.
Many of the challenges we face, from poverty to armed conflict, are linked to the effects of global warming.
Finding a solution to climate change can bring benefits in other areas.
A greener planet will be a more peaceful and prosperous one too.
The U.N. was founded, famously, to "end the scourge of war.
" We often confuse that with the dispatching of peacekeepers to this or that zone of conflict.
I see it differently.
The basic building block of peace and security for all peoples is economic and social security, anchored in sustainable development.
It is a key to all problems.
Why? Because it allows us to address all the great issues—poverty, climate, environment and political stability—as parts of a whole.
Consider Darfur, where I've put considerable diplomatic effort during my first year as Secretary-General.
It is, of course, most immediately a challenge of peacemaking and peacekeeping.
But Darfur's violence began with the onset of a decades-long drought.
Farmers and herders came into conflict over land and water.
If this root problem is not addressed—if the challenges of poverty alleviation, environmental stewardship and the control of climate change are not tied together—any solutions we propose in Darfur will at best be a temporary Band-Aid.
That brings us back to climate change.
No place is immune, neither the arid Sahel of Africa nor the grain-exporting regions of Australia nor the drought-prone Southwest of the U.S. To fight it, the U.N. family, including the Nobel Prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, has begun tapping into a pool of global resources—scientific and engineering expertise, corporate engagement and civic leadership.
We have begun to appreciate more fully how the world's dazzling know-how can solve the seemingly unsolvable when we view our problems through the right perspective.
This year at the U.N., as we link the crucial agendas of poverty reduction and climate change, we must remember that among the best minds are the farmers, doctors and community leaders at the local level who have worked out ingenious solutions to urgent challenges.
They tell us that there are indeed pathways, at modest cost, to clean and sustainable energy systems, high-yield agriculture in Africa and improved water management in drought-prone regions of Asia, Africa, the Middle East and the Americas.
This year could mark a watershed at the U.N. We will undertake climate-change negotiations in earnest and accelerate our efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals to fight poverty, hunger and disease.
As we embark on this great undertaking, we might recall the historic importance of American leadership in this fight.
In 1963, President John F. Kennedy told the U.N. General Assembly, "The effort to improve the conditions of man...is not a task for the few.
It is the task of all—acting alone, acting in groups, acting in the United Nations.
For plague and pestilence, plunder and pollution, the hazards of nature and the hunger of children are the foes of every nation.
The earth, the sea and the air are the concern of every nation.
And science, technology and education can be the ally of every nation.
" Let us heed that sound advice.
Hot Ideas from the Climate Change Kitchen
Yesterday, I was on the train, reading James Hansen's latest research paper on Climate Sensitivity "Target Atmospheric CO2 : Where Should Humanity Aim?
" :-
They touched on CSR, Corporate Social Responsibility, and what their company was doing about it, as a large player.
They discussed that they had been fishing around for projects.
They mentioned recycling, the waste of resources, personal and social development.
Not once did they mention Energy.
Or Climate.
He read a few lines of the paper and seemed to be involved by it, but he handed it back quite quickly.
If this was his only exposure to the horrifying risks of Global Warming, of course he wouldn't take it in.
He has been taught to think in relative terms, not absolute.
Fast-forward in time by about an hour to the large hall of Friends' House at Euston in central London.
A debate around the Climate Change Bill.
This was another context in which to assess the words of James Hansen.
"If we take action on Carbon Dioxide we shall be fit for purpose".
He said there is still much to do if we want to show leadership, and that the Climate Change Bill still needs strengthening.
The Climate Change Bill as currently presented will commit us to a 60% cut in Carbon Dioxide Emissions, he said, but that "60% is out of date", according to the most recent science.
Tony Juniper said that he believes that the Prime Minister should head the "50 years of implementation" of the Climate Change Bill, as it can't be done by any one Government Department.
He said we have to get it right at the start, as the future chair of the Climate Change Committee might not be as strong as Adair Turner.
Yes, he had written in the Evening Standard about his acceptance that the Climate Change Bill Carbon Targets will need to get tougher :-
"We read the changing science", he assured the audience, and explained that the decision about targets would be made by the Climate Change Committee, following a clear process.
"Of course we have to respond.
" It was not clear from his words when the response would be forthcoming.
Hilary Benn said that the biggest risk we face is people saying "it's too hard" to do anything about Global Warming.
That does appear to be the new excuse from the skeptics (see bottom of page).
He said that the Climate Change Committee has a new duty to engage with the public, consult the experts and publish all their work.
If the Government rejects their findings, they will have to state why.
The real test, he said, is going to be changing the mindset of the Government, who are giving speech after speech about Climate Change and then signing in expansion of airports (loud cheers).
He said we need a green tax switch, and we need to public opinion to emphasise that politicians' jobs are on the line if they don't adopt the right angle.
#3 If the Climate Change Committee says 80% or higher, will you accept it ?
Peter Ainsworth said that it had been suggested that the Climate Change Committee would be responsible or setting targets, but that this was not seen as democratic.
Peter Ainsworth said that Climate Change was the economic opportunity of the 21st Century, and that he thought "frankly, it's illiterate to portray it as anything else.
"
Maybe we should have signs stuck on the sides of new Porsche cars "Warning : this car is damaging the Climate".
#7 Nicky Gavron from the London Assembly asked about the urban contribution to the Climate problem, as 75% of the total, and whether this should determine the choice of London's Mayor.
#8 Lucy Pearce from Stop Climate Chaos and I Count : asked about all the e-mails, letters and postcards that the campaign have been sending.
She said that SCC has a clear campaign policy to demand 80% Carbon Cuts, and said that campaigners had made many demands, but : "HOW MANY IS ENOUGH ?
"
More questions were raised : about demands for aviation and shipping to be included in the Climate Change Bill from the very start.
Ali Abbas had come all the way from Manchester to ask this question.
Hilary Benn waffled on about amounts and questions about how to divide them.
He said that the Climate Change Committee had to follow the process to come up with the results.
That it was important to follow the process...
Nature throws one-two punch at global warming : 20 Apr 08 : The Nature article says the climate problem is much greater than forecast by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change due to rising use of coal in Asian nations, especially China and India, where energy use is projected to double by 2030 :-
“We’ve gotten this hopelessly wrong,” said Roger Pielke Jr. of the University of Colorado at Boulder, one of the authors of the Nature article.
The trio also included Tom Wigley of the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research and Economics professor Christopher Green of McGill University in Montreal.
Pielke is basically saying that global warming is SO BAD, that we can't do anything about it.

The "Live Earth" shows that start Saturday in Australia are meant to be more than a planetary party.
Event founder Al Gore hopes they will kick-start a global civic crusade to combat climate change and to inspire individuals everywhere to do their part.
Will the event mark the debut of a "Global Warming Generation" – a significant shift in attitudes and behavior?
Or will it simply be a fun, musical follow-up to Mr. Gore's film, "An Inconvenient Truth," that resonates little beyond the current advocates?
Reporting from eight countries indicates that today the issue is most relevant to residents of the US and Europe.
But in the developing countries where the concerts are being held, such as China, South Africa, and Brazil, few citizens appear to see global warming as a pressing personal problem.
In Turkey, the concert was canceled because it couldn't get enough local support.
In industrialized nations, where more people say they are worried by climate change, surveys indicate that not many of them are yet doing much about it in their daily lives.
Eighty-eight percent of Americans believe individual actions can have a positive impact on climate change, according to a poll carried out in anticipation of the "Live Earth" concerts, and 51 percent of those who had heard about the event expected it would inspire them to do more.
Critics, such as Roger Daltrey, former lead singer for "The Who," and Bob Geldof, the original global-gig guru, have said that the last thing the world's climate needs is a yeti-sized carbon footprint left by rock stars jetting to venues that will tap megawatts of electricity for lighting and sound systems.
"Live Earth" planners counter that they have deployed "sustainability engineers" at all the venues to make them as green as possible, from using recycled toilet paper to LED lights.
And they say that hundreds of millions of people are not aware enough of global warming's threat.
In China, which is about to overtake the United States as the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, climate change came 13th on a list of 14 environmental concerns in an opinion poll last year, way behind food safety and air pollution.
"The sense of urgency is still not so big as in other countries," says Ma Jun, head of the Institute for Environmental and Public Affairs, a Beijing think tank, "because here air and water pollution threaten people's health directly every day.

Since 7.50 am this morning, 20 participants in this year's Camp for Climate Action and members of Action Against Agrofuels have been blockading the only access gate to Cargill's European regional head office in Cobham, Surrey.
8 activists have locked on to the gates closing the site down completely.
Agrobusiness giant Cargill are being targeted by the protesters for their role in rainforest destruction and land-grabbing as well as for profiteering from the food crisis.

Since 7.50 am this morning, 20 participants in this year's Camp for Climate Action and members of Action Against Agrofuels have been blockading the only access gate to Cargill's European regional head office in Cobham, Surrey.
8 activists have locked on to the gates closing the site down completely.
Agrobusiness giant Cargill are being targeted by the protesters for their role in rainforest destruction and land-grabbing as well as for profiteering from the food crisis.
Hannah Ritchie from the group says: “Cargill is using the boom in agrofuels to expand soya, palm oil and sugar plantations, displacing communities, food crops and destroying ecosystems.
Destroying rainforests and other biodiverse ecosystems, including healthy soils, is one of the quickest ways of heating the planet.
This is why we are blockading the Cargill office two days before the official start of the Climate Camp at Kingsnorth.”
Jordan Craig says: “For companies like Cargill, agrofuels are an opportunity to make more profits from food, to take over more land from small farmers and communities and to further destroy local food production.
This is why we need an immediate halt to government policies such as the mandatory blending of petrol and diesel with biofuels in the UK, as well as an end to 'free trade' food and agricultural policies which solely boost the power and the profits of agribusinesses like Cargill.
Instead of agrofuels, we need to have policies that support Food Sovereignty, i.e.
which put people's right to food first and support small-scale, biodiverse, organic farming, instead of energy-intensive agriculture.”
About the harm which Cargill is causing to communities and ecosystems in Brazil, Paraguay and Papua New Guinea, see
According to the UN World Food Programme, 100 million more people are going hungry as food prices have risen by 83% in three years.
In the UK, man y families are struggling to afford a basic diet.
In East Africa, 13 million lives are at risk from record grain prices as well as drought.
Agrofuels (biofuels from crop and tree monocultures) are fuelling the crisis.
Last year, 100 million tonnes of grains were turned into fuel and vast areas of land, previously used for food, are being turned into lantations to grow crops for our cars.
Thanks to agrofuels, big agribusiness is making record profits from rising oil prices, as companies can afford to sell food at the price of oil.
Agrofuels make soya, palm oil and sugar cane more profitable, so companies are cutting down and burning more forest for plantations.
Cargill are taking control of even more land than before thanks to agrofuels.
Destroying rainforests and other biodiverse ecosystems, including healthy soils, is one of the quickest ways of heating the planet.
Vast amounts of carbon are released and large areas of land dry up affecting rainfall.
“This system that is being implemented by Cargill is affecting us negatively.
The intensive and extensive production of soy is poisoning us and leaving us with fewer natural resources to survive as a people.

Glacial retreat: "With few exceptions, all the alpine glaciers of the world are losing mass and it is predicted that this trend will continue as global warming progresses.
Glaciers in alpine areas act as buffers.
During the rainy season, water is stored in the glaciers and the melt water helps maintain river systems during dry periods.
An estimated 1.5 to 2 billion people in Asia (Himalayan region) and in Europe (The Alps) and the Americas (Andes and Rocky Mountains) depend on river systems with glaciers inside their catchment areas.
In areas where the glaciers are melting, river runoff will increase for a period before a sharp decline in runoff.
Without the water from mountain glaciers, serious problems are inevitable and the UN’s Millennium Development Goals for fighting poverty and improving access to clean water will be jeopardized" United Nations Environment Programme, 2007 Global Outlook for Ice and Snow.
Glacial retreat since 1850 has been worldwide and rapid, affecting the availability of fresh water for irrigation and domestic use, mountain recreation, animals and plants.
These all depend on glacier-melt, and in the longer term and to some extent so does the level of the oceans.
Studied by glaciologists, the coincidence of glacial retreat with the measured increase of atmospheric greenhouse gases is evidence underpinning anthropogenic climate change.
Mid-latitude mountain ranges such as the Himalayas, Alps, Rocky Mountains, Cascade Range, Glacier National Park, and the southern Andes.
This is also ocurring in tropical glacier summits such as Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa, and Chacaltaya Glacier in Bolivia which are showing some of the largest proportionate glacial loss.
The Little Ice Age was a period from about 1550 to 1850 when the world experienced relatively cool temperatures compared to the present.
Subsequently, until about 1940 glaciers around the world retreated as the climate warmed.
Glacial retreat slowed and even reversed, in many cases, between 1950 and 1980 as a slight global cooling occurred.
However, since 1980 a significant global warming has led to glacier retreat becoming increasingly rapid and ubiquitous, so much so that many glaciers have disappeared and the existence of a great number of the remaining glaciers of the world is threatened.
In locations such as the Andes of South America and Himalayas in Asia, the demise of glaciers in these regions will have potential impact on water supplies, and flooding from 'mountain tsunamis' .
The retreat of mountain glaciers, notably in western North America, Asia, the Alps, Indonesia and Africa, and tropical and subtropical regions of South America, has been used to provide qualitative evidence for the rise in global temperatures since the late 19th century.
The recent substantial retreat and an acceleration of the rate of retreat since 1995 of a number of key outlet glaciers of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets foreshadow a rise in sea level, having a potentially dramatic effect on coastal regions worldwide.
The continued glacial retreat will have a number of different quantitative impacts.
In areas that are heavily dependent on water runoff from glaciers that melt during the warmer summer months, a continuation of the current retreat will eventually deplete the glacial ice and substantially reduce or eliminate runoff.
A reduction in runoff will affect the ability to irrigate crops and will reduce summer stream flows necessary to keep dams and reservoirs replenished.
This situation is particularly acute for irrigation in South America, where numerous artificial lakes are filled almost exclusively by glacial melt.
The potential for major sea level rise depends mostly on a significant melting of the polar ice caps of Greenland and Antarctica, as this is where the vast majority of glacial ice is located.
ABC Climate Change Consulting this week headlines an article by its 'profiled person' on "What the IPCC Lead Authors didn't get to say" -- go to http://abccarbon.com/
A short article on transparency in climate change communication by Professor Henderson-Sellers recently published and available on the Environmental Research web site:
In the final months of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Fourth Assessment reporting in 2007, the world’s three leading climate science agencies asked people directly and intimately involved with the report for their views on how the process had gone and some of the key issues it raised.
The three agencies in question: the Global Climate Observing System Programme (GCOS), the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), and the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) are the world co-ordinators of observations and research on climate change.
They also held a workshop in Sydney in October 2007 on Learning from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, for which I drafted an outline of a workshop paper, based entirely on responses to the survey.
Here I want to go back and check whether the first glimpse we received of the "real gut feeling" of some of the IPCC authors and co-ordinators as they finished up the humungous task of completing the Fourth Assessment Report held steadfast throughout the Sydney meeting process and the subsequent re-writings of views and clarification – and sometimes perhaps cleaning up – of opinions.
I have done this because I believe it is essential for the climate change research community to be transparent and honest about what it can and cannot deliver and how, if ever, current inadequacies can be resolved.
Urgent policy issues that climate change research must tackle
• Monitoring the trajectory of climate change to assess whether we are heading into a danger-zone and how fast/where.
Serious inadequacies in climate change prediction that are of real concern
• The rush to emphasize regional climate does not have a scientifically sound basis.
• Until and unless major oscillations in the Earth System (El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) etc.
) can be predicted to the extent that they are predictable, regional climate is not a well defined problem.
It may never be.
If that is the case then we should say so.
It is not just the forecast but the confidence and uncertainty that are just as much a key.
• Climate models need to be exercised for weather prediction; there are necessary but not sufficient things that can best be tested in this framework, which is just beginning to be exploited.
• Energy budget is really worrisome; we should have had 20 years of ERBE [Earth Radiation Budget Experiment] type data by now- this would have told us about cloud feedback and climate sensitivity.
I'm worried that we'll never have a reliable long-term measurement.
This combined with accurate ocean heat uptake data would really help constrain the big-picture climate change outcome, and then we can work on the details.
• Thorough understanding of the physics and dynamics of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, with a view to predicting sea level rise within 20% for a specified change in climate over the ice sheets.
• Establishing the likelihood of Amazon die-back – carbon dioxide source instead of sink.
• Bringing the carbon cycle models to a level comparable with the physical climate change models and fully incorporating them.
• Working Groups (WG) I and II ought to be rethought and perhaps combined with a different approach.
WG III is involved in mitigation and is somewhat more separable except where effects of mitigation are sought and climate models have to be run to assess effects of "what if" scenarios.
• Special reports on ice sheets and on the climate carbon-cycle feedback should be planned in 2-3 years, if not by IPCC then by someone else.
• Progress requires more attention to addressing basic model flaws.
Without alleviating these, future IPCC assessments will look very similar each time.
What a waste of resources...climate science will get what it deserves if it does not apply itself more to basics rather than what it is doing currently.
• There is a strong need to promote merging of IGBP and WCRP and revitalizing the international framework for climate science.
• "Human-ware" is very much a depleted commodity, especially younger scientists having the urge and motivation to delve into climate problems.
This rarely gets mentioned as a serious point.
• Attention to the simulation of "weather" by climate models, thus accounting simultaneously for the verification of the so-called "fast" and "slow" time-scale processes.
It seems to me, even one year later, that the urgency and forthrightness of many of these comments still hold and need to be shared, discussed and acted upon.
Those that concern me most include the simple, but dastardly, statement that "until and unless major oscillations in the Earth System can be predicted to the extent that they are predictable, regional climate is not a well defined problem.
It may never be.
The rush to emphasize regional climate does not have a scientifically sound basis.
" This is underscored in another quote: "adding complexity to models, when some basic elements are not working right (e.g.
the hydrological cycle) is not sound science.
" (The italics are mine.
)
Did the final workshop outputs genuinely deliver these messages as clearly as they are stated here?
Did we say "the IPCC was designed 20 years ago ... we absolutely need a complete re-think" and "we need more time to learn from each other how to do integrative research to answer key questions"?
My personal view is that we did not.
Perhaps due to the natural desire to tone down criticism in written documents and perhaps because some of us wonder what else can be said – e.g.
WGI is "becoming a bit repetitive and may have little original to say other than 'we told you so last time and mean it even more now!
'" Also there is real reluctance to state too baldly the magnitude of the challenges to be overcome before climate change research can deliver relevant results.
In some places there is an (unhealthy?
) fear of mis- (or out of context) quoting by global warming "deniers".
We are hesitant to stress comments such as "the Fourth Assessment Report missed doing this owing essentially to the timelines that were arranged.
" Another interesting example of this fear is that the original suggestion was to entitle the Sydney workshop, "What did the IPCC get wrong?
" This proposal was quickly squashed in the corridors of the World Meteorological Organisation lest the anti-greenhouse lobby picked it up and repeated it as criticism of the IPCC.
Climate change research entered a new and different regime with the publication of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report.
There is no longer any question about "whether" human activities are changing the climate; instead research must tackle the urgent questions of: "how fast?
"; "with what impacts?
'; and "what responses are needed?
" Climate change researchers cannot hide behind the need to improve models and observations any longer.
Answers are now being demanded faster than, and at higher resolutions than, research can deliver.
It is clear that climate change will remain a risk management problem for the foreseeable future.
However, the more we can constrain distribution functions of important process variables or outcomes like climate sensitivity or damages, the better will be humanity’s chances of adaptation.
The cleverer we are in the design of relevant and deliverable climate change results, the sooner we constrain the potential for some really "dangerous" outcomes that cannot currently be ruled out at less than a 10% chance.
One essential ingredient is transparency in communication.
I hope that this article goes some way to ensure this.
In the background lurks another crisis — the risk of dangerous climate change .
Although these changes are slow-moving, increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases will risk more climate catastrophes that will damage human wellbeing and conceivably lead to mass unemployment in the very long run.
These two crises are not independent.
Both arise from human greed largely unrestrained by ethics, or concern for others in distant lands, or future generations.
And the state of the world's finances can either hinder our efforts to tackle climate change or, if the world responds correctly, provide an unrivalled opportunity to help.
The most prominent policies at the moment are market-based instruments such as emissions trading schemes , which put a price on carbon dioxide emissions.
But the financial crisis is rendering such policies ineffective.
Carbon allowance prices in the EU emissions trading scheme have hit new lows recently as plunging economies reduce the demand for electricity.
So how can investment best achieve climate change stabilisation at different carbon prices?
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 's fourth assessment report, published in 2007, examined this and concluded that most actions proven to reduce greenhouse gas emissions involve regulation, tradable permits or carbon taxes.
Not so many involve direct government investment, such as making buildings more efficient, reducing deforestation, investing in public transport, and subsidising and supporting research in renewable energy.
As the financial crisis continues, there is widespread recognition of a need for substantial investment by governments — fiscal stimuli — to restore confidence, spending and employment to more normal levels.
This is where resolving the financial crisis can help climate policy.
The investment should be in decarbonising national economies and international transportation at an accelerated pace.
This of course does not mean that the financial crisis helps to address the climate change problem because the effect is hopefully short term.
But the crisis may provide the stimulus we need to move to a low-carbon economy.
In dismal economic times, investments in things such as infrastructure and new technologies become available at lower cost and greater benefit than at other times.
So let us take stock.
We have a critical and deepening global financial crisis that demands large-scale job-creating investment.
And we have an impending global climatic crisis that could be partially solved by large-scale job-creating government investments.
If it cannot be quickly resolved, the financial crisis itself could seriously undermine the market-led climate change policies we have, so there is an increasing need to go for more direct investment approaches to tackle climate change.
The answer is obvious.
The resolution of the global financial crisis must be seen as an opportunity to kick-start a rapid shift to a low-carbon economy, which is absolutely necessary in the coming decades if we are to avoid dangerous global climate change.

Sir David King also happens to be a member of the Copenhagen Climate Council, a group of 30 prominent leaders in business, science, and policy who have come together to create global awareness of the importance of the U.N. Climate Change Conference, COP15, in Copenhagen, in December 2009.

Politicians have failed to take on board the severe consequences of failing to cut world carbon emissions , according to Nicholas Stern , the economist commissioned by Gordon Brown to analyse the impact of climate change .
His stark warning about the potentially "devastating" consequences of global warming came as scientists issued a desperate plea last night for world leaders to curb greenhouse gas emissions or face an ecological and social disaster.
More than 2,500 climate experts from 80 countries at an emergency summit in Copenhagen said there is now "no excuse" for failing to act on global warming.
A failure to agree strong carbon reduction targets at political negotiations this year could bring "abrupt or irreversible" shifts in climate that "will be very difficult for contemporary societies to cope with".
Katherine Richardson, a climate scientist at the University of Copenhagen, who organised the three-day summit, said: "We have to act and we have to act now.
We need politicians to realise what a risk it is they are taking on behalf of their own constituents, the world's societies and, even more importantly, future generations.
All of the signals from the Earth system and the climate system show us we are on a path that will have enormous and unacceptable consequences.
"
This week's conference was arranged to offer an update on scientific thinking on global warming, and underpin political attempts to agree a new global climate treaty to replace the Kyoto protocol.
Campaigners have called for such a deal to be signed at UN talks in December, also in Copenhagen, though officials have warned the discussions could drag on into next year.
"The climate system is already moving beyond the patterns of natural variability within which our society and economy have developed and thrived.
These parameters include global mean surface temperature, sea-level rise, ocean and ice sheet dynamics, ocean acidification, and extreme climatic events.
There is a significant risk that many of the trends will accelerate, leading to an increasing risk of abrupt or irreversible climatic shifts.
"
The summary adds: "There is no excuse for inaction.
We already have many tools and approaches - economic, technological, behavioural, management - to deal effectively with the climate change challenge.
But they must be vigorously and widely implemented.
"
In the conference centre that will also host the December UN negotiations, experts at this week's meeting presented a string of new studies that suggested global warming could strike harder and sooner than expected.
They said carbon emissions have risen more in recent years than anyone thought possible, and the world's natural carbon stores could be losing the ability to soak up human pollution.
· A 4C rise could turn swaths of southern Europe to desert.
Kevin Anderson, research director at the UK Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, said: "The scientists have lost patience with our carefully constructed messages being lost in the political noise.
And we are now prepared to stand up and say enough is enough.
"
Peter Cox, a climate expert at Exeter University, said: "People have been saying this individually for a long time.
This is just a much louder and concerted shout from our community.
"
Rob Bailey, senior climate adviser for Oxfam said: "The verdict of the world's top scientists is clear.
The big question now is whether the worlds richest countries, who created the climate crisis, will act before it's too late.
Our climate is changing fast and if left unchecked its impacts, particularly on the world's poorest people, will be devastating.

Pt 3 - Carboholics: The Power Industry and Global Warming (length 49:43)
Pt 5 - How much technology do we need to solve the climate problem?
(length 43:42)
In 2004 Steve Pacala and I introduced the “stabilization wedge” as a useful unit for discussing climate stabilization.
A wedge is the reduction of global CO2 emissions by one billion tons of carbon per year in 2057.
Any campaign or strategy designed to mitigate carbon emissions can be measured in wedges.
Implementing eight wedges should enable the world to achieve the interim goal of emitting no more CO2 globally in 2057 than today, and in the following 50 years driving CO2 emissions to net zero emissions would place humanity, approximately, on a path to stabilizing the climate at a concentration less than double the pre-industrial concentration.
Eight wedges may be available from an aggressive, globally coordinated scale-up of a mix of already commercialized or nearly commercialized technologies.
Carbon numeracy needs to become part of general education.
Increasing the competitiveness of carbon mitigation technology and accelerating its delivery worldwide are challenges that need the attention of the most talented researchers.
Interconnections between Air Pollution, Climate Change and Health
Air pollution levels are highly sensitive to weather, and it follows that climate change will likely have air quality implications.
In turn, air pollutants are recognized to be major climate forcing agents and are well known to have detrimental effects on human health, agriculture and ecosystems.
Policies to mitigate climate change could have important implications for air quality and vice versa.
It is becoming increasingly important to view air quality from a global perspective and to integrate air quality and climate stabilization goals in the design of environmental policy.
This talk will provide an overview and analysis of the interconnections between air pollution, climate change and their impacts on human health and will discuss opportunities for jointly addressing them.
Carboholics: The Power Industry and Global Warming
As the 10th largest electricity generator in America, NRG has a strong interest in climate change.
In his address, Crane will discuss the electric power sector’s view on climate change, our role in it and how we, as an industry and as a corporation, should respond to threats to our climate.
It is NRG’s view that the power sector needs to acknowledge its role in climate change, demonstrate leadership in slowing, stopping and reversing greenhouse gas emissions and then lead the way toward helping other sectors address their problems.
Crane will talk about technological, market and political solutions to the problem and how we in America need to lead on the issue if we are ever to solve this problem globally.
More then 70% or Kenya’s wildlife lives outside protected areas.
The challenge facing conservation biologists is determining if wildlife populations can be sustained on these landscapes while the welfare of humans also inhabiting them can be improved.
Otherwise, Kenya’s wildlife will be restricted to game reserves and national parks where barriers to movement and climate induced changes in habitat distribution threaten survival even in these refuges.
Studies on the ecology and behavior of two zebra speices—the endangered Gravy’s zebra and the more abundant Plains zebra—sharing the semiarid grasslands of north-central Kenya with pastoral herders and their livestock illustrate the problems facing ‘charismatic megafauna’ in general.
They also provide important insights into how basic research, when focused on problems of animal survival and reproduction as well as range use and ecohydrology, can point the way to reducing tension between people and wildlife.
Today’s talk will examine how science and engineering can help empower people to sow the seeds for sustaining landscapes where multiple landuse will be the way of life long into the future.
How much technology do we need to solve the climate problem?
The amount of new technology required to solve the climate problem obviously depends on how much carbon-free energy we need.
This talk focuses on the scientific and economic uncertainties surrounding the required emissions cuts.
I first review the relationship between expected damages from climate change and the atmospheric concentration of CO2.
Here, the primary uncertainties come form a large class of poorly understood possibilities, such as the rapid de-glaciation of Antarctica and Greenland.
After looking at the risks, the next step is to set a target.
The target behind most pending bills before Congress is to prevent the atmospheric CO2 concentration from rising above 450 ppm.
Then, one must forecast both the time evolution of natural sinks for CO2 if the atmospheric target is met, and the emissions that would have occurred without any mitigation.
The uncertainty at each of these steps is large enough to create a factor of two uncertainty in the amount of mitigation required, and the errors of all four steps compound one another.
Even so, the time scale over which we are learning is too slow to substantially reduce these uncertainties before we must either act or allow significant and dangerous climate change.

'Growing in the Greenhouse' sets out Brazil's ethanol indutry as an example.
If this is an example for climate-friendly growth then I'd rather not see any of it.
Brazil's sugar ethanol sector has driven the destruction of the Atlantic Forest (not over 90% destroyed - a biodiversity hotspot, according to WWF).
the Cerrado (the most biodiverse savannah in the world, now mostly destroyed) and the Pantanal wetlands.
Brazilian sugar is very profitable indeed, with the most appalling working conditions (reports of slavery and child labour, women being told they must get sterilised or lose their jobs, terrible health impacts), water pollution is awful, air pollution causes respiratory problems as all the vegetations is burnt to grow the sugar.
Yet at so many UN Conferences, other countries are told they should emulate this example.
And the UK have partnership with Brazil to implement similar policies in southern Africa.
From what i've read about the amazon there seem to be a range of drivers to deforestation, with sugar cane not being one of them but i`m not sure about the Atlantic Forest and Pantanal.
"Brazil's sugar ethanol sector has driven the destruction of the Atlantic Forest (not over 90% destroyed - a biodiversity hotspot, according to WWF)"
I'm interested in what Robert le Breton says about deforestation in the Atlantic Forest not being linked to sugar ethanol.
I have read in various sources that deforestation has been ongoing and a fair proportion of it is for land conversion to sugar cane.
See here, for example:
I don't see how one can distinguish between 'deforestation for ethanol' and 'deforestation for non-ethanol sugar plantations' - ultimately the marekt is driven by overall demand and ethanol is responsible for a large market share.
Biofuels in tropical countries (i.e.
soybeans in the Amazon rainforest and cerrado, and oil palm in southeast Asia) often involve these issues (actually the same would probably be true outside the tropics if we hadn't already cleared our wildlands for agriculture).
Biofuels certainly have positive attributes, especially when they are developed on already degraded lands, but there are serious concerns when natural ecosystems are converted for their production.
In these cases do the benefits of using biofuels versus fossil fuels outweigh biodiversity loss and disruption of ecological services?
Probably not, though I am not familiar enough with the situation to know for sure.
The social issues associated with plantations ("virtual slavery") in some parts of the world are particularly alarming as well.
If one could ensure that biofuel production occurred only on degraded lands and waste/pollution/effluent could be minimized/reused then I think there's a lot to be said for bioethanol.
I don't think we're there yet though.
to water pollution, and sugar factories are potentially big polluters, They
1.
According to information presented at a United Nations Environment Program workshop, deforestation is causing about 20% of annual emissions of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.
A study published by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences found that over the last 15 years, Brazil and Indonesia were the largest contributors to deforestation.
I do not know if the recent deforestation in Brazil has anything to do with ethanol production.
2.
In the United States where I live, ethanol is starting to become very popular.
Currently, the reasons have mostly to do with the cost of oil, the economic boost ethanol production gives to farmers who grow corn and the desire for energy independence.
In the future, it is very likely that the potential for ethanol and other biofuels to help fight global warming will also contribute to ethanols growing popularity.
I have heard some of our policiticans say that we should drop or relax restrictions on imported sugar which could be used to produce ethanol (and for other uses).
While it is most likely that the U.S. will look for domestically produced feedstock to make ethanol, it is not impossible that we would look to import feedstock as well.
If at some point the U.S. drops or relaxes restriction on imported sugar, that could create new demand for Brazilian sugar.
If that happened,while it would benefit the Brazilian sugar growers, it may aggravate the Brazil deforestation problem .
Biofuels are becoming increasingly popular all around the world and countries that have limited agricultural capacity (e.g.
Japan) might look to import feedstocks like Brazilian sugar for ethanol production.
3.
What all this suggests to me is that, while producing ethanol (or other biofuels) from farm products has many benefits, including environmental benefits such as combating global warming, it requires careful planning to do it right.
I'm gratified that our publication should have attracted so much response.
I'd like to comment on three issues that have been raised on this blog: deforestation, labor conditions and energy balance.
The issue of the ethanol market and its effect as a driver for deforestation is one that has not had enough serious analysis.
It's a fair criticism that much Brazilian analysis on the biofuels sector (including, to be honest, our Brazilian authors from the University of Sao Paulo) has underplayed the role of biofuels in driving deforestation in tropical regions.
However, neither is it right to suggest that the ethanol programs as such have been behind the destruction of the Atlantic rainforest.
Land issues in Brazil are a highly complex issue, both in terms of understanding the data and in getting to grips with the political and moral issues around Brazilian land ownership.
My impression is that there has yet to be a satisfactory analysis of the drivers of deforestation in Brazil, but the basic points are:
3.
How those pressures lead to deforestation is complex.
Brazil is a major exporter of ag products, and these are driven by world prices.
It's not a purely domestic matter, so it's not correct to think that 1Ha sugar cane = 1 Ha of displaced soya production (or whatever) elsewhere in Brazil.
Finally, Robin is mistaken about the energy content of biofuels.
This IS a major question in the United States, where ethanol is made from corn.
This is a crazy way to make ethanol, and you only get 1.2 or 1.3 units of energy out for every unit of energy you put in.
However, with Brazilian ethanol it's very different - you get some 7 to 9 units out per unit of energy used in the process.
Since much of the energy in the process is derived from burning the fibrous parts of the sugar cane itself this produces great energy and climate benefits.
Two final thoughts.
First, different biofuels have very different impacts.
I worry A LOT about oil palms for biodiesel, which do seem to be a major driver of deforestation in South East Asia.
Second, please compare biofuels not to nothing but to other forms of energy.
It is a fact that ANY technology to provide energy on the massive scale that the world uses it will have major impacts on people and the environment.
We should try to minimise energy consumption to keep those impacts down, but they will alwasy be huge.
So don't measure biofuels against the Garden of Eden, but against the alternatives.

Current knowledge about observed impacts of climate change on the natural and human environment.
The IPCC 4th Report Climate Change Impacts Adaptation and Vulnerability summary looks at the relationship between observed climate change and recent observed changes in the natural and human environment.
A full consideration of observed climate change is provided in the IPCC Working Group I Fourth Assessment.
Information here is based largely on data sets that cover the period since 1970.
The number of studies of observed trends in the physical and biological environment and their relationship to regional climate changes has increased greatly since the Third Assessment in 2001.
The quality of the data sets has also improved.
There is, however, a notable lack of geographic balance in data and literature on observed changes.
This means information for developing countries is scarce and as a result the developing countries are not well represented.
More on observed impacts
The following is a selection of the key findings regarding projected impacts, as well as some findings on vulnerability and adaptation, in each system, sector and region for the range of (unmitigated) climate changes projected by the IPCC over this century judged to be relevant for people and the environment.
The impacts frequently reflect projected changes in precipitation and other climate variables in addition to temperature, sea level and concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide.
The magnitude and timing of impacts will vary with the amount and timing of climate change and, in some cases, the capacity to adapt.
4.
The IPCC 4th Report Climate Change Impacts Adaptation and Vulnerability show magnitudes of impact can now be estimated more systematically for a range of possible increases in global average temperature.
Since the IPCC Third Assessment, many additional studies, particularly in regions that previously had been little researched, have enabled a more systematic understanding of how the timing and magnitude of impacts may be affected by changes in climate and sea level associated with differing amounts and rates of change in global average temperature.
More on magnitudes of impact.
5.
Impacts due to altered frequencies and intensities of extreme weather, climate, and sea level events are very likely to change.
Some adaptation is occurring now, to observed and projected future climate change, but on a limited basis.
There is growing evidence since the IPCC Third Assessment of human activity to adapt to observed and anticipated climate change.
For example, climate change is considered in the design of infrastructure projects such as coastal defence in the Maldives and The Netherlands, and the Confederation Bridge in Canada.
Other examples include prevention of glacial lake outburst flooding in Nepal, and policies and strategies such as water management in Australia and government responses to heat waves in, for example, some European countries.
More detail on climate adaptation and mitigation.

Concern regarding climate change has finally gone mainstream in the U.S., shown by the current Time Magazine cover story .
"Never mind what you've heard about global warming as a slow-motion emergency that would take decades to play out.
Suddenly and unexpectedly, the crisis is upon us... From heat waves to storms to floods to fires to massive glacial melts, the global climate seems to be crashing around us.
" Perhaps now we can act?
Time Magazine's cover story, is a rude awakening.
We better take note, of what they are saying.
Our live's, may very well depend upon it.
We are dealing with a situation, comparable to the last ice age, in modern time's.
With climate variable's so horrific, that people wont know what hit them.
The current D.E.O.S.
Gulf Stream scan's, show a huge failing of that system.
Check it out, it's fading all over the place.
Due to fresh water intrusion, from melting sea ice.
It's also starting to change shape, the first signs of a rerouting back south.
It look's like, the pentagon's 2003 scenario ( The Coming Climate Collaspe ) is no longer a scenario !
Now it's time to worry.
very interesting info and data.
I knew when Natl Geographic finally featured a story on the far reaching implications on Global warming that the world could no longer ignore it, without looking like morons.
Now all we need to do is revolt against our consumerist society, decarbonise our energy systems, stop deforestation, help the south with there progress and everything will work out just fine...
Climate change crashing around our ears?!!
I THINK NOT!
Absolute denial the world has been in, especially the U.S. People have been working doggedly within the system in the UK for years preparing mitigation and adaptation plans etc.
85% of American's , now believe in Global Warming.
The other 15% live in the White House.
Now that Time Magazine confirmed, that ( The Day After Tomorrow )is upon us.
What are our solution's ?
Four U.K. government officials, just introduced a plan , that would change the economic lifestyle of the U.K. people drasticaly.
Reason, their current green house gas policie's are failing.
They state, we now have to put Global Warming ahead of Economic Growth to achieve our goals.
If not, we will lose this battle we can't afford to lose.
Since the U.K., is year's ahead of us on this issue and are still failing.
How far are we, willing to go on this issue.
Their point is, you can't have it both way's , one has to suffer so the other will achieve dominance.
We have awakened an angry Beast, and it's not going to be easy to tame her.
It's going to take a huge amount of sacrafice to tame her.
As a people ,are we willing to do this.
That worrie's me more!
For every 100 mile's we drive, we put 70 pound's of c02 into the Atmosphere.
Time's that, by 200 million vehicle's in the U.S. alone. S.U.V.s are still the vehicle of choice in the U.S. ...... some getting as little as 13 mile's to the gallon.
We are going to have to make a choice......... Prosperity Or Survival..... it's our choice.
I want to learn more about the plan proposed by UK government officials that you mentioned - the one that involved putting global warming ahead of economic growth as a priority.
I completely agree: we'll never be able to do anything about climate change until we accept that "You can't have it both ways": prosperity (US style) or survival
I believe it was the Washington Post.
The same day when i posted it.
It did'nt give their names, but said they were equal to U.S. Congressman in status.
It stated.... their plan would turn the U.K. lifestyle upside down, and that Global Warming had to be put in front of Economic growth.
It did'nt give much details.
Everything i mentioned in the earlier post was about it.
Hope this help's.
The world's leading climate scientists will soon report that global warming could cause the Earth's temperature to rise to levels far higher than previously predicted.
Under the auspices of the United Nations' forthcoming and most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report , scientists will report they:
"are now unable to place a reliable upper limit on how quickly the atmosphere will warm as carbon dioxide levels increase.
The report draws together research over the past five years and will be presented to national governments in April and made public next year.
It raises the possibility of the Earth's temperature rising well above the ceiling quoted in earlier accounts... Such an outcome would have severe consequences, such as the collapse of the Greenland ice sheet and disruption of the Gulf Stream ocean current... The scientific agenda has moved from improving the predictions to thinking about what are the chances of something awful happening.
"
The new IPCC report will underpin international talks on how to cut greenhouse gas emissions when the first phase of the Kyoto protocol expires in 2012.
There has long been discussions at international climate forums that abrupt and runaway climate change was a real possibility as feedbacks such as methane hydrates, melting permafrost and forest dieback caused by initial climate changes resulted in further carbon dioxide release.
These concerns were excised from early reports after vigorous lobbying by the oil industry and their governments they control such as the U.S. and Saudia Arabia.
To the United States of Exxon, I sure hope those extra years of windfall profits were worth jeopardizing the prospects of stabilizing the Earth's climate.
You have acted criminally and will be punished for your crimes.
Well, we know the Gulf Stream, has slowed down by some 30% already.
The season's, dont know when to start and end.
The central state's are projected for another snow storm.
The weather down here in Florida, is going to run 5 to 10 degree's below normal this weekend.
With windchill's in the upper 20's at night.
Im wondering , the projection's of a slower Gulf Stream, would lower temp's by 5 to 10 degree's.
Are we seeing the early sign's of that now?
During the little Ice Age, temp's ran 5 to 10 degree's below normal in the U.S. . Summer's never really came and Winter's never ended !
For the first time, wide ranging impacts of changes in current climate have been documented: retreating glaciers, longer growing seasons, shift of species ranges, and health impacts due to a heat wave of unprecedented magnitude.
The observed changes described above are consistent with those projected for future climate change.
Nearly all European regions are anticipated to be negatively affected by some future impacts of climate change and these will pose challenges to many economic sectors.
Climate change is expected to magnify regional differences in Europe’s natural resources and assets.
Negative impacts will include increased risk of inland flash floods, and more frequent coastal flooding and increased erosion (due to storminess and sea level rise).
The great majority of organisms and ecosystems will have difficulties adapting to climate change.
Mountainous areas will face glacier retreat, reduced snow cover and winter tourism, and extensive species losses (in some areas up to 60% under high emission scenarios by 2080).
In Southern Europe, climate change is projected to worsen conditions (high temperatures and drought) in a region already vulnerable to climate variability, and to reduce water availability, hydropower potential, summer tourism, and in general, crop productivity.
It is also projected to increase health risks due to heat waves and the frequency of wildfires.
In Central and Eastern Europe, summer precipitation is projected to decrease, causing higher water stress.
Health risks due to heat waves are projected to increase.
Forest productivity is expected to decline and the frequency of peatland fires to increase.
In Northern Europe, climate change is initially projected to bring mixed effects, including some benefits such as reduced demand for heating, increased crop yields and increased forest growth.
However, as climate change continues, its negative impacts (including more frequent winter floods, endangered ecosystems and increasing ground instability) are likely to outweigh its benefits.
IPCC Climate Change Europe: Adaptation to climate change is likely to benefit from experience gained in reaction to extreme climate events, by specifically implementing proactive climate change risk management adaptation plans.
(Working Group II Contribution to the IPCC, 4th Assessment Report, Climate Change Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, Summary for Policy Makers.
)
1.
Current knowledge about observed impacts of climate change on the natural and human environment
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Working Group II 4th Report, Summary for Policy Makers looks at the relationship between climate change and recent observed impacts in the natural and human environment.
Information is based largely on data sets that cover the period since 1970.
The number of studies of observed trends in the physical and biological environment and their relationship to regional climate changes has increased greatly since the Third Assessment in 2001.
The quality of the data sets has also improved.
There is, however, a notable lack of geographic balance in data and literature on observed changes.
This means information for developing countries is scarce and as a result the developing countries are not well represented.
1.
Observational evidence from all continents and most oceans shows that many natural systems are being affected by regional climate changes, particularly the observed impacts of temperature increases.
With regard to changes in snow, ice and frozen ground (including permafrost ), there is high confidence that natural systems are affected.
Examples are:
• changes in some Arctic and Antarctic ecosystems, including those in sea-ice biomes, and also predators high in the food chain
The IPCC reports on observed impacts, and there is high confidence, based on substantial new evidence, that observed changes in marine and freshwater biological systems are associated with rising water temperatures, as well as related changes in ice cover, salinity, oxygen levels and circulation.
These include:
The uptake of anthropogenic carbon since 1750 has led to the ocean with an average decrease in pH of 0.1 units [IPCC Working Group I Fourth Assessment].
However, the effects of observed ocean acidification on the marine biosphere are as yet undocumented.
Limitations and gaps in the IPCC 4th Report Climate Change Impacts Adaptation and Vulnerability prevent more complete attribution of the causes of observed system responses to anthropogenic warming.
First, the available analyses are limited in the number of systems and locations of observed impacts.
Second, natural temperature variability is larger at the regional than the global scale, thus affecting identification of changes due to external forcing.
Finally, at the regional scale other factors (such as land-use change, pollution, and invasive species) are influential.
3.
Other effects of regional climate changes on natural and human environments are emerging, although many are difficult to discern due to adaptation and non-climatic drivers.
• some human activities in the Arctic (e.g., hunting and travel over snow and ice) and in lower elevation alpine areas (such as mountain sports, e.g., skiing in the Alps and Andes ).
Recent climate changes and climate variations are beginning to have effects on many other natural and human systems.
However, based on the published literature, the observed impacts have not yet become established trends.
Examples include:
• Settlements in mountain regions are at enhanced risk to glacier lake outburst floods caused by melting glaciers.
Governmental institutions in some places have begun to respond by building dams and drainage works.
• Sea-level rise and human development are together contributing to losses of coastal wetlands and mangroves and increasing damage from coastal flooding in many areas.
IPCC Observed Impacts - Figure Above.
Locations of significant changes in observations of physical systems (snow, ice and frozen ground; hydrology; and coastal processes) and biological systems (terrestrial, marine, and freshwater biological systems), are shown together with surface air temperature changes over the period 1970-2004.
A subset of about 29,000 data series was selected from about 80,000 data series from 577 studies.
These met the following criteria: (1) Ending in 1990 or later; (2) spanning a period of at least 20 years; and (3) showing a significant change in either direction, as assessed in individual studies.
These data series are from about 75 studies (of which ~70 are new since the Third Assessment) and contain about 29,000 data series, of which about 28,000 are from European studies.
White areas do not contain sufficient observational climate data to estimate a temperature trend.
The 2 x 2 boxes show the total number of data series with significant changes (top row) and the percentage of those consistent with warming (bottom row) for (i) continental regions: North America (NAM), Latin America (LA), Europe (EUR), Africa (AFR), Asia (AS), Australia and New Zealand (ANZ), and Polar Regions (PR) and (ii) global-scale: Terrestrial (TER), Marine and Freshwater (MFW), and Global (GLO).
For the eighth time the U.S. Republican Party -- the party of big oil and climate change -- has held future green energy hostage [ ark ] in the Senate to an insistence upon drilling every last bit of oil in every last wildernesses' intact ecosystems first.
Given an American addiction to cheap fossil fuels necessary to power climate changing conspicuous consumption [ ark ] as the meaning of life, the public appears willing to fall lemming like into line with the myth that the "energy crisis" can be solved by drilling.
Paying the full cost of energy including upon the environment is no crisis.
This comes as MIT researchers appear to have overcome a major technological limitation to economical solar energy storage [ ark ], perhaps removing the last major barrier to solar energy charged fuel cells [search] handling base energy loads.
Green energy advances are being made constantly, and solar and wind energy is ready for wholesale introduction, but faces market obstacles that can be offset by renewing renewable energy tax credits similar to those enjoyed by traditional fuels.
It is reprehensible that realistic opportunities to produce green energy locally while saving our shared atmosphere are being treated as no more than a political football.
One can only wish a special place in the coming climate hell for these bad people.
However, I personally feel pretty strongly that we really haven't the right to leave an excessively polluted set of ecosystems for those coming up behind us.
All of this ignores the very real choices that we make daily that affect other species, the biosphere as a whole (correct spelling for this world, BTW) and other humans IN THE PRESENT, WHICH IS ALL THAT WE REALLY HAVE, including the poorest of the poor who cannot make the same choices we do, because they do not have the means.
So if you believe that everything and everyone is indeed connected, this line of thinking is irrelevant, or better yet, relegated to its rightful place: college classes in Western philosophy.
I agree with ewoc.
Putting it more primitively, I believe strongly that as with all animals, human primates instinctively seek the continuation of their species and genes.
This selective pressure is a requirement evolutionarily for any species to propogate.
For human society to decide it is too difficult to change our profligate behavior in order to maintain the biosphere, and decide to just party it up and trash the planet, would be against these ingrained behaviors.
And it would also just be ethically atrocious, indicating the depth of our depravity.
Yes the Earth and each of us will die/end -- but a great deal remains to be determined regarding the quality of time now and for our remaining future, and how much time there will be.
This moronic question unfortunately underlies alot of ecocidal behavior.
Ecological Internet welcomes Australia’s expression of concern about forests and climate change, demonstrated by yesterday's release of an initial US$2 million in aid [ ark ] for Asia-Pacific nations to help protect forests and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
But it is unfortunate these efforts to maintain forest carbon [search] are only being applied overseas, are based upon flawed science, and thus will be unlikely to make much difference.
An important new study from Australian National University researchers recently found that first-time logging of ancient primary forests results in more than a 40 percent reduction in long-term carbon compared with unlogged forests[1].
Further, untouched natural forests were found to store three times more carbon dioxide than previously estimated and 60 percent more than plantation forests.
These findings directly contradict industry propaganda that logging old-growth is climate friendly.
"For forests to be maximally effective in addressing climate change, these findings suggest the focus of Australian forest policy should be upon preserving primary forests with strict protections from industrial development; and focusing upon regenerating secondary natural forests' old-growth characteristics while meeting needs for certified forest products," explains Ecological Internet's President, Dr. Glen Barry.
"If Australia, Papua New Guinea and Indonesia are sincere in their efforts to establish payments for forest protection, and if these efforts are really going to protect regional climate and biodiversity, they are going to have to forego industrial forestry in each of their remaining primary forests.
Anything else is greenwash with grave local and global ramifications.
"
Australia continues large scale first time industrial logging and other clearing of their important ecosystems, with massive release of carbon and drying of water resources, even as their government promotes forest protection internationally to combat climate change.
In Tasmania, ancient forests are clearfelled to make disposable paper products, tropical rainforests are cleared for agriculture in Queensland, and logging of rare jarrah continues in the southwest's precious Gondwana forest remnants.
The Australian government is encouraged to rely upon ecological science rather than industry propaganda in regards to forests and climate.
"It is preposterous to impose massive costs upon society for a new carbon trading market while ignoring how first time industrial logging of primary forests in Australia and regionally is a primary driver of climate change.
These activities can, and should, be discontinued relatively inexpensively.
The Australian government ignores their own University science that first time logging damages carbon stores, funding yet further rounds of "sustainable forestry" aid overseas while continuing to log their own forests, at great peril for Australia's climate and ecological sustainability.

I certainly agree that logging needs to be restricted and biodiversity protected where appropriate but i also think the aus govt has every right to promote sustainable practices overseas.
We have 70% of old growth permanently protected in aus.
Should we ignore the atrocious conditions overseas forests are subjected to while we squabble over the other 30% and import theie products in the meantime?
I think not.
Climate Skeptic Slap Down: the Earth is Demonstrably Heating
Recently climate skeptics [search] and sympathetic press have claimed there has been no global warming for a decade.
New Scientist does a marvelous job of debunking [ ark ] this selective misreading of climate data by lay skeptics.
Using a powerful yet simple analogy, they illustrate that surface temperatures are only one measure of global heat increases.
Surface temperatures only reflect what is happening to the very thin layer where air meets the land and sea.
But long-term how much heat is gained or lost by the entire planet, called the "top of the atmosphere" radiation budget, is what matters.
Claims that global warming is non-existent is further confounded by the fact surface temperatures in the Arctic, the place on Earth where the greatest warming is occurring, is not measured by a permanent base.
And 1998 was unusually warm due to El Nino conditions.
But the smoking gun, in terms of data demonstrating ongoing global heating now, is the self-evident strong ocean warming [search] .
Water holds 1000 times as much heat as air.
The recent IPCC Fourth Assessment Report [ search ] found that since the 1960s, over 90% of the excess heat due to higher greenhouse gas levels has gone into the oceans, and just 3% into warming the atmosphere.
This heat being soaked up by the oceans will inevitably spill back into the atmosphere and raise surface temperatures.
The science is clear -- both in terms of direct measurement and hundreds of observational studies showing changes in wildlife behavior, plant phenology and other impacts.
Anyone not trusting thousands of expert climate top scientists, to listen to an occasional lay skeptic protecting narrow economic self-interests, is just plain dumb.
This continued denial is causing great harm to us all.
Let's get on with devising and implementing sufficient solutions to save being.
I LOVE ALL YOU PSEUDO-SCIENTISTS!
ALL YOU WANT IS TO ALTER OUR ECONOMY INTO A "COMMAND" Marxist?
ECONOMY (PROVE ME WRONG!).
YOU WANT TO IGNORE THE OVER 13,000 SCIENTIST WHO PUT THEIR NAME ON THE LINE RECENTLY, SAYING THAT ANY GLOBAL WARMING WAS NOT, I SAY AGAIN N-O-T CAUSED BY HUMAN, I REPEAT AGAIN "HUMAN" ACTIVITY!
By the way, Mike, would that petition you are citing be from the group in Cave Junction, Oregon?
As an Oregonian I find it quite amusing that this piece of misinformation is still floating around on the Web - it's been around for years now - and it keeps getting repeated over and over, especially on Fox and talk radio shows.
That does not make it proof of anything, by the way.
Nice try, though.
By the way, did anyone ever tell you that using the cap lock feature on your computer, rather than making you convincing, actually makes you look kinda silly?
After my single, not-so-great generation finishes the `missions' (ie, fools' errands) the leading, self-proclaimed "masters of the universe" among us have set before the human community, what resources will be left for our children to consume; how many more people will have to share what remains of the dissipated and degraded resources; where will they find clean air to breathe, clean water to drink?
I shudder when thinking about what our children might say about what we have done so poorly and failed to do so spectacularly, all for sake of selfishly fulfilling our insatiable desires for endless material possessions and freedom without responsibility.......come what may for the children, coming generations, global biodiversity, the environment and Earth's body.
I thought I would keep going until I found someone whose credentials reflected completion of even a Bachelors degree in climatology or one of the atmospheric or marine or earth sciences.
I gave up after an hour's search process.
We religiously promote our widely shared and consensually-validated fantasies of `real' endless economic growth and soon to be unsustainable overconsumption, overproduction and overpopulation activities, and in so doing deny that Earth has limited resources and frangible ecosystems upon which the survival of life as we know it depends.
Second, my not-so-great generation appears to be doing a disservice to everything and everyone but ourselves.
We are the "what's in it for me?
" generation.
We demonstrate precious little regard for the maintenance of the integrity of Earth; shallow willingness to actually protect the environment from crippling degradation; lack of serious consideration for the preservation of biodiversity, wilderness, and a good enough future for our children and coming generations; and no appreciation of the vital understanding that humans are no more or less than magnificent living beings with "feet of clay.
"
Third, most of our top rank experts appear not to have found adequate ways of communicating to the family of humanity what people somehow need to hear, see and understand: the rapacious dissipation of Earth's limited resources, the relentless degradation of the planet's environment, and the approaching destruction of the Earth as a fit place for human habitation by the human species, when taken together, appear to be proceeding at breakneck speed toward the precipitation of a catastrophic ecological wreckage of some sort unless, of course, the world's colossal, ever expanding, artificially designed, manmade global political economy continues to speed headlong toward the monolithic `wall' called "unsustainability" at which point the runaway economy crashes before Earth's ecology is collapsed.
The so-called "Oregon Petition" originated from a father-son duo with no particular background in climate science who lived in Cave Junction, Oregon, an area inhabited by a motley collection of Christian Fundamentalists, aging ganja growers, and some California retirees.

By the way, I found the very same post (i.e.
verbatim) that you offered here on a well-known climate skeptic website.
You state that you have no political agenda, other than avoiding any tax impacts of climate policies you disagree with, which would apparently describe any cap and trade system, carbon tax, or in fact any other policies based on the assumption that carbon emissions are actually a problem for our species, since you maintain that there is little or no relationship between GHG emissions and climate.
However, it's difficult to imagine how that is not actually a political agenda.
Maybe I am just being ignorant, given you background and extensive experience in the field.
The Bush administration has tried to silence a top climate scientist at NASA, stopping him from speaking out since he gave a lecture last month calling for prompt reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases linked to global warming.
It is one thing to have a policy difference (however misinformed), it is quite another to stifle and censor climate science.
The Bush administration has crossed the line and their climate change policy is now criminally negligent.
The blood of the Earth and human civilization will forever be on the neocons' hands unless they immediately commit to emissions reductions, carbon taxes and massive renewable energy investments.
I am sure we are no longer able to have much impact on what is happening to our climate today but the lie that 'nothing is happening that people need worry about' must be challenged.
People need to know, for exanple, that if they are living in a vulnerable area, on a flood plain or an area prone to hurricanes for example, maybe they should consider taking action to help themselves.
It is a crime to keep spearding the myth that there is nothing to be concerned about while some governments are doing nothing to protect their citizens from the inevitable consequences of climate change, that is just bad government.
Stifling people who are trying to warn of these dangers is a crime.
Twenty years ago we could have changed our lifestyle and maybe had an effect on global warming but don't think it is much good today, we need to adapt to the inevitable.
By adapting to what is to come we will inevitably change the way we live.
The sooner we face that the better.
It is not an issue of the right or the left it is an issue of survival of mankind!
The crusade to keep ipê out of Ocean City's boardwalk reconstruction is a rejection of Forest Stewardship Council and big greens' efforts to certify and greenwash industrial ancient forest logging as being responsible, while falsely implying sustainability.
First time logging of primary rainforests -- selective, certified, ecosystem based or otherwise -- results in an immediate huge release of carbon, permanent reductions in future carbon sink potential, and reductions in species numbers and diversity.
One of the gravest obstacles to mitigating climate change, conserving ancient forests and achieving global ecological sustainability is the pernicious myth that selectively logging ancient forests (certified or not) is environmentally beneficial.
It is NOT.
With just over 15% of the world's ancient forest existing in large, intact blocks; areas that are critical for continued functioning of ecosystems and the biosphere, what remains MUST be protected in an intact state that is free from all industrial activities.
Ensuring the Earth's continued capacity to provide humanity and our sister species our habitat; including addressing climate change, ending the extinction crisis and maintaining freshwater resources, depends critically upon ending ancient forest logging and finding methods to compensate local peoples and governments for avoiding deforestation AND forest diminishment such as that wrought by "certified" logging.
Promising efforts to promote avoided deforestation through established carbon markets -- whereby governments and local peoples are paid for maintaining intact forests -- are deeply threatened by this false notion that selectively logging ancient forests can be done while maintaining many of their ecological values.
Carbon payments for forest protection will only prove beneficial climatically and ecologically if the payments are for avoided deforestation AND diminishment -- that is, preservation rather than conservation, of all remaining ancient forests.
Much confusion exists on this point, even amongst well-meaning forest conservationists, yet to suggest otherwise is to promote the next biofuels boondoggle; where the solution is as bad, or worse, as the original ecological crisis itself.
First time heavy and industrial selective logging of ancient forests is nearly as bad as outright deforestation in terms of reduction in carbon sequestration, loss of biodiversity and general change in ecosystem functionality.
The World Bank and many world governments are joined by the Forest Stewardship Council, Greenpeace, WWF and Rainforest Action Network in falsely suggesting that ancient forests can be logged industrially in a manner that will not permanently disrupt their carbon sequestration and will not result in long term loss of biodiversity.
If you support these organizations you are profoundly personally responsible for the climate and biodiversity crises, and are stymying the last best chance to stop ancient forest logging and save the Earth.
And so we are making a stand against climatic and rainforest ecocide in Ocean City, New Jersey of all places!
Should this misconceived use of ancient rainforests for ocean boardwalks progress, if you can, please join myself and others in possible non-violent direct action to stop the project sometime this fall.
Time is running out to address the crises facing global climate, ecology and the biosphere.
It is time to take a stand, speaking ecological truth, and placing our minds and bodies between ecosystems and their destroyers (however well intentioned but misinformed they may or may not be).
The old trees are such wise beings and feel like old friends to me.
Cutting them down, and ruining forest ecosystems with any industrial activity, amounts to murder in my mind.
3) On the frontier of "intact forest" there are many locations (Brazil, Congo Basin, Southeast Asia) where the absence of economic alternatives for local people is resulting in them cutting down forests for other economic alternatives - such is the force of poverty that often drives deforestation.
Is it even viable to expect that they will stop this behavior without economic alternatives?
Removing the option of doing good forest management is something that indigenous groups such as the Kayapo Indians in Brazil or numerous other human communities reject.
Instead, they are pursuing well-designed systems for the extraction of forest products, from brazil nuts to timber, or even ecotourism, or other less intrusive economic options.
FSC does NOT promote timber harvesting - it promotes environmentally, socially and economically viable forest conservation and management.
For example, in Guatemala, the management of natural forests by local communities has resulted in a reduction of fires and illegal logging, and conservation of the forest.
In fact, as has been documented by conservation scientists, FSC certified community forestry operations in Guatemala have proven more successful in such protection and conservation efforts (documented using satellite imagery) than adjoining national parks, while at the same time generating revenue on a portion of their forests through timber and non-timber forest products extraction and ecotourism.
From our perspective, which may be quite different than yours, Ocean City's actions to support FSC certification also support forest conservation, contribute to stopping deforestation, foster economic livelihoods for indigenous and other local communities, and are having a positive impact on climate change.
And we would also suggest that the alternatives being considered, such as the use of fossil fuel based alternatives (e.g.
plastic decking), may not in fact make a positive contribution on our world's climate.
We strongly support recycling (we certified FSC recycled paper and wood products), but we also think that the full range of economic, social and environmental values must be considered in such decisions, and to eliminate FSC certified raw materials as an option is short-sighted from that perspective.
The Danger of Poorly Designed "Avoided Deforestation" Carbon Payments
However the REDD approach is not without risk.
Our primary concern is that carbon payments will support industrial first time selective logging of primary rainforests [search] , based on the misconception this substantially protects these ancient rainforests' carbon stores (and biodiversity).
Such diminishment in fact permanently destroys carbon storage potential, is only slightly better ecologically than outright deforestation, and as such primary forest logging is unworthy of avoided deforestation payments.
To be effective and avoid " leakage ", continued ancient forest logging must not be allowed anywhere in countries receiving international monies to protect their rainforests for climate benefits.
There are a whole slew of other concerns that must be addressed to ensure that the concept of avoided deforestation payments is not usurped by industry as has been done to good ideas such as sustainable development and certified forestry.
These include avoided destruction simply moving to another location, long-time local forest protectors being unable to receive payment, and destructive industries making outrageous claims they benefit the climate.
Most problematic -- while the rainforest and climate crises rage, avoided deforestation and general international climate policies poke along at a glacial pace.
The level of urgency and action is not equal to the threat, so a good idea is almost certainly too little too late.
I don't believe a dime of the money goes to any good purpose.
It's all smoke and mirrors.
The only way we're going to prevent or at least survive the coming global climate change cataclysm is to find out how to live our lives with less.
Reacting to increasing Amazonian deforestation in recent months, Brazil has banned the sale of farm products from illegally deforested ares in the Amazon [ ark | more \ ark ].
It should be noted deforestation rates [search] do not include rainforest diminishment caused by industrial first time logging and other activities that may leave some trees, but effectively destroy ancient rainforest ecosystems and release much of their carbon.
Policies announced included imposing fines for buying or trading illegally produced beef and soy, sending in seven hundred more troops, and establishing a land registry.
The Brazilian government has recently been trumpeting 50% reductions in deforestation over the past two years.
However, these decreases appear to have been more a result of declines in agricultural markets than any fundamental reduction in deforestation, and as markets recover deforestation and climate change soars.
If we keep overpopulating Earth; if we keep conspicuously overconsuming limited resources; and if we keep endlessly expanding big-business activities, thereby polluting the relatively small, evidently finite, noticeably frangible planet as we keep doing now, then a good enough future for our children cannot be assured, can it?
As this first decade of the 21st Century slips past with negligible progress in all the vital areas for the combat of Climate Change, I am well down the path of thinking that the end result is indeed inevitable.
Gaia has to help herself if we cannot achieve the unanimity and the speed to help her, and to help herself is to eliminate the cause of her problems.
Humanity.
Humanity is in danger of losing the exquisite value in one of God’s great gifts: the carefully and skillfully developed science on climate change and global warming.
Could it be that the current gigantic scale and unchecked growth rate of the global economy is unsustainably driving increases both in adamant per human over-consumption and skyrocketing human population numbers toward the point in human history when the willful, rampant, unregulated growth of consumption, production and propagation activities of the human species precipitates the collapse of Earth’s ecology, even in these early years of Century XXI?
In order to stabilize the concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere, emissions would need to peak and decline thereafter.
The lower the stabilization level, the more quickly this peak and decline would need to occur.
Mitigation efforts over the next two to three decades will have a large impact on opportunities to achieve lower stabilization levels.

Decision-making about the appropriate level of long term mitigation over time involves an iterative risk management process that includes mitigation and adaptation, taking into account actual and avoided climate change damages, co-benefits, sustainability, equity, and attitudes to risk.
Choices about the scale and timing of GHG mitigation involve balancing the economic costs of more rapid emission reductions now against the corresponding medium-term and long-term climate risks of delay.
Integrated assessment of the economic costs and benefits of different mitigation pathways shows that the economically optimal timing and level of mitigation depends upon the uncertain shape and character of the assumed climate change damage cost curve.
To illustrate this dependency:
o if the climate change damage cost curve grows slowly and regularly, and there is good foresight (which increases the potential for timely adaptation), later and less stringent mitigation is economically justified;
• Climate sensitivity is a key uncertainty for mitigation scenarios that aim to meet a specific temperature level.
Studies show that if climate sensitivity is high then the timing and level of mitigation is earlier and more stringent than when it is low.
• Delayed emission reductions lead to investments that lock in more emission-intensive infrastructure and development pathways.
This significantly constrains the opportunities to achieve lower stabilization levels and increases the risk of more severe climate change impacts.
TAKE ACTION: Dam construction must not damn opportunity for protection of one of Asia's last intact, fully functional natural ecosystems.
The Cardamom Mountains [search] in Southwest Cambodia -- one of the world’s priceless ecological treasures -- contain the region's last true wilderness with untouched rivers cascading to the Gulf of Thailand.
This is one of Asia's last unbroken, large primary forest expanses with wild waterways linking mountain-top and ocean, containing still intact extensive tracts of lowland evergreen forest, and holding over 40 globally threatened species.
The Cambodian government is preparing to dam and flood the Cardamom Mountains' riverways with a dubious hydroelectric scheme.
There are many better-suited dam sites in the Cardamom landscape than the Areng River.
Prime Minister Hun Sen's government should demonstrate wise leadership and fully protect the Cardamom Mountains.
TAKE ACTION!
Its similar in the sense that the Mokihinui catchment is wild and almost untouched by development.
It has rare wildlife like kiwi the whio/blue duck, magnificent rainforests and is regularly hit by huge earthquakes which ravage the landscape but replenish fertility.
The company hasnt even done a seperate earthquake report.
Its quake evidence is hidden away in the engineering, landscape and sediment reports.
Having worked in the Cardamoms with Conservation International since 2003, your posting surprises me.
Yes, this dam is not ideal for conservation, but only 3-4 globally threatened species will be affected by the dam in such a way as to jeopardise their populations (your figure of 31 species came from a report I drafted, but it fails to recognise that most of these species are terrestrial and will move away from the inundation zone).
There will still be over 1M ha of pristine forest for these species to move into, and at least four other river systems.
In fact, our detailed surveys since 2004 clearly show that over 50 GT species rely on the watershed for this dam, and that the dam will provide vital value to maintenance of this watershed.
The EIA team, who we worked closely with to ensure their report uses excellent data, has produced a good report.
The dam company has asked us for quotes for mitigation of wildlife conflicts, and has asked for a figure for annual expenses to cover management of the watershed.
This could triple the funding for the montane forests, which is where the real biodiversity and the endemic species live.
For example, the Areng valley only contains around 1,000 people (whose livelihoods we have been supporting for half a decade), which is not high density for Asia, and is actually negligible for relocation (there are good plans for relocation by the government and the communities) considering the vast power output from this dam and the positive returns for the development of Cambodia's economy.
Cambodia has some of the most expensive electricity in the world and this leads to deforestation for charcoal and fuelwood.
So the dam is not all bad.
In a fortnight we are hosting a meeeting between NGOs and the Cambodian ministries, in particular the Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy.
Our message is clear: it is possible to reconcile conservation and development in the same landscape.
They can benefit from each other, in terms of watershed and biodiversity management and in terms of funding for conservation while supporting economic development.
It has taken us months for the government to trust us at all, as they are tired of being told they are wrong and they are hurting their environment.
We standby our biocentric analysis, and do not accept your premise that the world's last intact ecosystems can be both developed and protected.
We have already surpassed the amount of biodiversity and ecosystems that can be lost and sustain an operable biosphere.
Your apologist approach is part of the problem, impeding an ecological awakening at the magnitude required to sustain and restore global ecological systems.

(Earth) -- Rainforest Action Network (RAN) of San Francisco has long been one of America's leading rainforest campaign organizations.
Yet in July their campaign to protect Ontario, Canada's boreal forests [search] doomed half this vital global ecological system to industrial destruction.
In return, RAN and other proponents received vague promises of protections over a decade from now, but no protected area boundaries or protection plans.
Canada's boreal forests are home to hundreds of sensitive species of animals including polar bears, caribou and wolverines.
Boreal forests are some of the world's largest carbon storehouses, with holdings equal to decades of global emissions from fossil fuels, while continually absorbing new emissions.
The boreal region is also the world's largest reservoir of clean fresh water.
"Just how much longer do you think environmentalists can strike deals that give up half of large wilderness ecosystems to industrial development for vague promises of protection?
Simply, more ecologically attuned folks know no more natural habitats can be lost and expect to survive climate change," explains Ecological Internet's President, Dr. Glen Barry.
Neither RAN, WWF or even Greenpeace realize that there is no longer any acceptable reason to industrially destroy or diminish an intact natural ecosystem -- not if falsely FSC certified, not to briefly alleviate poverty, and not because indigenous people are in favor.
The state of the Earth is so grim, and the needs to protect and restore natural ecosystem so large, that only sufficient campaigns seeking to end industrial cutting and burning are worthwhile any longer.
The rest is greenwash.
It is unknown if 50 percent protection -- of unknown strength and placement -- will be enough to fully sustain Ontario's biodiversity and ecosystem services.
Future protections will likely center on the sparsely populated and largely unthreatened northern boreal, while with its promotion and endorsement of the vague plan, RAN has greenwashed intensified forestry and mining in the already heavily fragmented southern boreal.
This is the second time in recent history -- the other being in British Columbia, Canada's priceless Great Bear temperate rainforest -- that RAN has been a driving force in continuing industrial loss of the world's most important remaining large, intact forest wildernesses.
Greenwashing millions of acres of industrial wilderness destruction in the name of indigenous rights is not doing these people or the environment any favors.
Thankfully, RAN now does little tropical rainforest campaigning, so they may be safe.
With more victories like this, soon there will be no ancient forests or an operable climate.
Dr. Barry laments, "You can’t present yourselves as cutting edge, selfless and knowledgeable forest protesters and be routinely cutting deals to turn over millions of acres of ancient forests to fatcat loggers and miners.
We need to focus on how many ecosystems are necessary to maintain the Earth's habitability, and reaching these levels of protection and restoration, not upon what can be indelicately and easily negotiated.
"
RAN is called upon to get on board protecting all ancient forests and working to restore mature, old-growth forests; or they, like so much of the mainstream environmental movement, are part of the climate and biodiversity crises.
"Giving up on half of Canada's boreal forests for a pocket full is mumbles is not the role of the Rainforest Action Network, members or donors.
They have no authority or expertise to be pursuing such deals.

About the level of discourse I have come to expect.
Read the release.
And then I ask you, why are you so afraid Bob of questions regarding failings of the current dominant environmental paradigms and failing forest protection strategies?
The one that RAN and others promote saying we log primary carbon and biodiversity rich forests with FSC certification and it is all fine, and that huge chunks of the world's remaining large, contiguous forest wildernesses can be traded for liquidation in order to protect other areas because we have enough to still give some away.
Perhaps you can tell me how FSC certified logging of a 500 year old ancient tree in a primordial ecosystem is sustainable or even remotely beneficial?
No one from RAN has yet.
As for your question "Why are you so angry at the larger environmental groups"?
RAN just negotiated away an area two times the size of Minnesota that lies in my bioregion, and got NOTHING concrete in return.
Hundreds of mines and logging operations that could have been resisted in the southern boreal will now go on unimpeded with the RAN seal of approval because in 15 years there might be some protections.
We hold every last one should be resisted, so when ecological crises worsen and awareness continues to shift in our favor, there is more to work with in terms of ecological restoration of a failing biosphere.
Keeping up with these reasoned arguments Bob?
There are very powerful and foundational discussions regarding how forests relate to global ecological sustainability that you Bob and RAN are unwilling and/or unable to hold.
Is widescale industrial development of primary forests acceptable if indigenous peoples so desire?
Are there enough ancient forests remaining to sustain atmospheric processes?
Can first time industrial logging of ancient forests be done carefully enough to maintain carbon, species and other values?

While these comments may be important for questions, a bit of research before using the valuable time of such as Dr. Barry, would benefit each of us, as well as their direct efforts to slow old-growth ecosystems.
Can't we all just get along a little here, people?
Do you really think we stand a chance of "being the change" and creating a future together if we single out groups of creative, committed people who work very hard, 24/7, to get the best deal for the Earth?
When you attack RAN, or any of the other groups you've singled out, you attack your sisters and brothers, and yourselves.
Perhaps there is another side to the story as well?
I know RAN and have followed them for many many years.
Not only were they part of a coalition that spared 5.4. million acres of old growth forest, but they also have campaigns in the Amazon and Indonesia, fighting to push Palm Oil plantations back, Soy Fields curbed, and the communities affected gain a greater voice and ultimate justice, but they also are working on some of the most serious elements of climate change.
RAN is drawing attention to the biggest banks in the world who are funding coal power in the US.
These are the coal plants that are fed by the destruction of the mountains and communities of Appalachia.
They have worked creatively and tirelessly to embarrass the automakers (and implicitly the complicit government) into increasing fuel efficiency, decreasing emissions, and bringing electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles to the country.
I invite you to turn your energies towards solving the problem rather than decrying the efforts past - and those that continue to go on - we all need to work together to save the forests, the climate, the global environment.
Back in the early 90's RAN led the calls for protection of rainforests.
But our local guy, who didn't otherwise work, collected money and set up protests against Mitsubishi, only to buy a brand new Mitsubishi at the same time.
We kicked him out of our all-volunteer eco-newspaper office for stealing.
He was also removed from the home of a disabled woman who had let him live there, believing he was devoted to environmental protection, but when she asked him to leave he would not.
He pled poverty all the time he was active here, but suddenly he had enough money to travel around Central and South America for several years.
When he recently showed up here again at the local environmental center, begging to use their resources to collect money for RAN, he was immediately run out of there as well.
But not before he talked some local newspapers into giving him free ad space.
ECOLOGICAL INTERNET CARRIES OUT A WIDE ARRAY OF PROTESTS REGARDING CLIMATE AND FORESTS -- ALL BASED UPON THE LATEST ECOLOGICAL SCIENCE AND WHAT IS KNOWN REGARDING REQUIREMENTS FOR GLOBAL ECOLOGICAL SUSTAINABILITY.
WITH TWO STAFF PERSONS, WE HARDLY FEEL THAT SEVERAL HUNDRED EMAILS CONSTITUTING A PROTEST SHOULD HAVE AGGRIEVED RAN QUITE SO DEEPLY.
YOU WILL FIND NOTHING IN THEIR RESPONSE WHICH DEFENDS THEIR NOTION THAT CUTTING ANCIENT FORESTS WITH FSC CERTIFICATION SOMEHOW PROTECTS THEM.
ONLY THE SUGGESTION THEY HAVE BEEN VICTIMIZED AND SUBTLE VILLIFICAITON OF THE MESSENGER.
A FULL LIST OF OUR RECENT CAMPAIGNS, THE ONLY ONE WHICH TARGETS NGOS BEING THIS FSC CAMPAIGN, CAN BE FOUND AT: http://www.ecoearth.info/shared/alerts/
A CAREFUL READ OF THE ECOLOGICAL SCIENCE INDICATES THAT HUMANITY HAS ALREADY OVERSHOT THE AMOUNT OF INTACT NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS THAT CAN BE LOST AND STILL MAINTAIN A HABITABLE EARTH.
THE GLASS IS NEITHER HALF FULL OR EMPTY, IT IS BROKEN.
CAMPAIGNING FOR ANYTHING LESS THAT WHAT IS NECESSARY -- FULL PROTECTION FOR THE EARTH'S REMAINING RELATIVELY NATURAL HABITATS -- IS INADEQUATE AND DANGEROUS GREENWASH.
IT MAKES US FEEL GOOD, BRINGS IN THE FUNDS, TINKERS AROUND THE EDGE OF THE PROBLEM WITHOUT INSISTING ANYONE GIVE UP ANCIENT FOREST TIMBERS, BUT IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO SUSTAIN BEING.
RAN CARRIES OUT RIGOROUS CAMPAIGNS TO END THE USE OF COAL, BIOFUELS AND OIL SAND FUELS -- YET DOES NOT SUPPORT ENDING ANCIENT FOREST LOGGING.
AFTER A YEAR OF PROTEST, PAGES OF EMAILS AND HOURS OF DISCUSSIONS, THEY HAVE NEVER PROVIDED ANY SUBSTANTIVE, DETAILED JUSTIFICATION FOR THEIR SUPPORT FOR FSC, AND HOW THIS CONTRIBUTES TO PROTECTING THE WORLD'S FORESTS AND ECOLOGICAL SUSTAINABILITY.
> - Yes, RAN recognizes FSC as the strongest independent environmental certification available for wood and paper products.
At the same time, RAN has significant concerns about the FSC.
In particular, we’ve been working to expose how new rules adopted by the program that we feel are lowering the bar on human rights and environmental protections.
ENVIRONMENTALISTS AROUND THE WORLD ARE FLEEING FSC IN DROVES FOR THE REASONS GIVEN ABOVE AND IN THE ALERT.
FRIENDS OF THE EARTH -- ANOTHER FSC FOUNDING MEMBER -- HAS WITHDRAWN, AND MANY EUROPEAN GROUPS ARE CONSIDERING DOING SO.
FSC EXISTS ON THE PREMISE THAT CENTURIES OLD TREES IN MILLIONS OF YEAR OLD ECOSYTEMS CAN AND SHOULD BE LOGGED.
THE BARBARIC PRACTICE OF CUTTING DOWN THE ECOSYSTEMS THAT MAKES THE EARTH HABITABLE -- LIKE SLAVERY BEFORE IT -- IS SIMPLY INDEFENSIBLE.
THERE IS NO WAY TO REFORM LOGGING OF PRICELESS PRIMEVAL ECOSYSTEMS.
FSC'S VERY PREMISE THAT PRIMARY FORESTS SHOULD BE CUT DOWN TO MAKE CONSUMER GOODS IS INDEFENSIBLE AND EVIL.
STOPPING ONE BAD CERTIFICATION ON ONE OCCASION DOES NOT OBVIATE THE DAMAGE DONE BY FALSELY GIVING COMFORT TO CONSUMERS THAT THEIR OLD GROWTH PRODUCT HELPED THE ENVIRONMENT, WHEN IN FACT IT EXACERBATED THE GLOBAL BIODIVERSITY AND CLIMATE CRISES.
THUS THE NEED FOR THE MOVEMENT TO UNITE BEHIND A SIMPLE MESSAGE: "END ANCIENT FOREST LOGGING".
HOW CAN YOU EXPECT CONSUMERS TO KNOW WHICH OF A HALF DOZEN CERTIFICATION SCHEMES IS BETTER?
FOREST WATCH AT http://www.fsc-watch.org/ SHOWS FSC IS BUSINESS AS USUAL INDUSTRIAL FORESTRY THAT ROUTINELY VIOLATES ITS OWN PRINCIPLES AND TRAMPLES ON INDIGENOUS RIGHTS AND GLOBAL ECOSYSTEMS.
FSC HAS SHOWN ITSELF TO BE IRREDEEMABLE, NO ONE INCLUDING RAN HAS PROVIDED ANY EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY, AND AT SOME POINT YOU ADMIT YOU ARE WRONG AND TRY SOMETHING ELSE.
> A record of RAN’s previous responses to criticism from Ecological Internet is available on the organizations’ website.
At the time, we were hoping to agree on next steps, and the dialogue was broken off by Ecological Internet with a declaration that we were not operating in good faith.
We believe that we can find common ground with allies, even when we disagree.
Since our founding over 23 years ago, RAN has had strategic differences with a number of allies and organizations; the key is using each others’ strengths and weaknesses effectively, taking advantage of ‘inside’ and ‘outside’ campaign strategies, and airing our differences privately but working to present a common agenda publicly in the face of overwhelming corporate power and a mounting crisis for our forests and climate.
RAN'S OLD-GROWTH CAMPAIGN SUPPORT FOR FSC THREATENS THE ECOLOGICAL SUSTAINABILITY OF THE EARTH.
DURING OUR FIRST ROUND OF DISCUSSIONS, EVERY SORT OF DIVERSIONARY AND PUBLIC RELATIONS TACTIC WAS USED IN ORDER TO AVOID ANSWERING A SIMPLE QUESTION: "HOW DOES LOGGING A CENTURIES OLD TREE IN A MILLION YEAR OLD ECOSYSTEM, OVER HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF HECTARES OF PRIMARY FORESTS, PROTECT THEM?
" RAN REFUSED TO ANSWER DIRECTLY, AND FINALLY ISSUED A ONE SENTENCE ANSWER THROUGH THEIR WEB MASTER WHICH READ:
FSC “is a vastly superior alternative to standard industrial logging.
In forests that would otherwise be logged without third party oversight, FSC promotes practices that preserve ecosystem functions (like habitat and water quality) and safeguards the most ecologically valuable areas.”
I HAVE SPENT MY ENTIRE ADULT LIFE STUDYING THE ISSUE OF GLOBAL CHANGE AND THREATS TO THE GLOBAL ECOSYSTEM.
I HAVE EARNED A MASTERS OF SCIENCE IN CONSERVATION BIOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, AND PHD IN LAND RESOURCES DEALING WITH THESE MATTERS.
I CAN SAY WITH CONFIDENCE THAT THERE IS NO CHANCE OF PLANETARY SURVIVAL IF THE MYTH THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO LOG ANCIENT FORESTS WITHOUT CRITICALLY DIMINISHING GLOBAL TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS IS NOT RIGOROUSLY DISCREDITED, STRONGLY TARGETING WHOMEVER MAY BE DOING SO.
I'm certainly glad to know that when the corporations cross the line there will be people to call them on it.
Loggers got to the old growth redwoods, and its like seeing the deforestation in the amazon rainforest to see areas like around prince george... A checkerboard of clearcuts.
Climate Central is a nonprofit, collaborative group of scientists and communicators.
Our mission is to create a bridge between the scientific community and the public, providing clear, honest, nonpartisan, and up-to-date information to help people make sound decisions about climate and energy.
Everything we do will ultimately zero in on a set of core questions.
Among them: What do we know today about the state of Earth’s climate?
How do we know it?
What do we not yet know, and how are we going to try and find out?
What might we do to prevent the most disruptive effects of climate change, and how might we adapt to those changes we can’t avoid?
How does our use of energy, land and natural resources interact with the climate?
The answers will continue to change as observations improve, as technology advances, and as scientific understanding of the climate system deepens.
Climate Central will keep the public informed about these changes through compelling stories that combine words, images and sounds to explain climate change and our possible responses to it—while remaining scrupulously faithful to the underlying science, and avoiding any sort of advocacy or partisanship.
We believe good information is the best foundation for sound choices.
In order to convey that information in the most engaging way possible, our written and video pieces, animations, interactive graphics, and other features are produced by a team that includes experienced graphic artists, producers, writers, editors and correspondents.
In order to remain rigorously aligned to the science, our communications professionals work hand-in-hand with Climate Central’s Ph.D.-level experts in the sciences, technology and public policy, and with an extended network that includes the world’s leading thinkers on climate science and policy.
Our staff scientists are also actively engaged in their own research, and continue to publish in leading journals.
In short, Climate Central combines sound science and vibrant media to increase public understanding and attention to the climate challenge.
The rate at which a volcano releases gases into the atmosphere (usually reported in metric tonnes per day) is related to the volume of magma within its magma-reservoir system and its hydrothermal system.
By measuring volcanic emissions, in particular changes of certain key gases like sulphur dioxide and carbon dioxide, scientists can infer changes that may be occurring in a volcano's magma reservoir and hydrothermal system.
The emission rates of sulphur dioxide and carbon dioxide are measured using airborne or ground-based techniques.
During large explosive eruptions, sulphur dioxide gas injected high into the atmosphere is measured by an instrument aboard a satellite.
These instruments have been in use for more than twenty years and are used for measuring sulphur dioxide emission rates from various volcanoes around the world.
They were originally designed for measuring industrial pollutants; the COSPEC measures the amount of ultraviolet light absorbed by sulphur dioxide molecules within a volcanic plume.
The instrument is calibrated by comparing all measurements to a known SO2 standard mounted in the instrument.
Although the COSPEC can be used from the ground in a vehicle or tripod (like that below) to scan a plume, the highest quality measurements are obtained by mounting a COSPEC in an aircraft and flying traverses underneath the plume at right angles to the direction of plume travel.
Use of a small infrared carbon dioxide analyzer (LI-COR) has recently become a standard method for measuring carbon dioxide emission rates at restless volcanoes.
The LI-COR is mounted in a small aircraft configured for sampling outside air.
Traverses measuring volcanic emissions are systematically flown through the plume at different elevations until the entire cross-section of the plume is analysed.
From these data, a carbon dioxide emission rate can be calculated.
The following parts of the instrumentation are located inside the aircraft: LI-COR carbon dioxide analyzer and flow control unit (instruments in middle A), GPS receiver (left A), and laptop computer (right A) for running data-acquisition software.
When the aircraft is over the target area, air and volcanic gases are sampled through a small tube (black tube beneath the COSPEC periscope, B).
The air intake is located well upstream of an aircraft's engine exhaust to avoid contamination.

Pushing the Envelope of Climate Science ‘Attribution Studies’ http://www.climatecentral.org/breaking/blog/pushing_the_envelope_of_climate_science_attribution_studies/
On August 17th and 18th, in the midst of a series of extreme summer weather events around the world, a meeting took place in Broomfield, Colorado, convening atmospheric scientists interested in the problem of event attribution, along with potential users of the attribution research information and experts in the communication of science to the larger public.
I was fortunate to be among them.
Event attribution seeks to explain the complex causes behind a given weather event, be it an especially cold winter, an intense heat wave or a devastating flood, with the particular aim of detecting a possible departure from “normal” conditions, and the role – if any – that human activities played.
The timing of the meeting, which was planned several months ago, could not have been better.
In fact, I wondered if its main organizers, Martin Hoerling , a research meteorologist at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and Peter Stott , a researcher at the U.K. Met Office, had secretly discovered a new weather forecast method that enabled them to anticipate the climatic mayhem that supplied us with our compelling background.
The ability to confidently attribute specific extreme weather events to manmade or natural causes would constitute a major step forward in our ability to understand the effects of human-caused climatic changes, particularly in their regional manifestations, and would supply us with the knowledge that so many in the media world wish we had (and I use “we” here as in “we climate scientists”) when they ask us those dreaded questions, along the lines of “Is the Russian heat wave due to climate change?” or “Are the Pakistan floods due to our flooding the atmosphere with greenhouse gases?” You may want to read our recent post on this topic.

So far, attribution research has resulted in studies of the causes of observed trends in global temperatures over recent decades, such as continental scale temperatures, large area-averaged precipitation trends, ocean temperature trends, long-term changes in atmospheric humidity and more.
Using sophisticated computer modeling and high quality observations, we are able to say with great confidence that in these changing aspects of our climate system, the fingerprint of human causes is already evident, as stated in the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fourth Assessment Report .
You’ll notice, though, that I’m talking about broad trends, large area averages, and long-term changes.
Such studies are very different from trying to attribute a measure of human causes to a one-off weather event, like the heat wave in Russia.
The presence of high natural variability in the day-to-day weather makes it difficult to isolate a signal of systematic change, especially when we target extreme events with our forensic studies.
Plus, the behavior of local climate is influenced by many causes that are difficult to measure, take apart, and simulate.

Note the high drought risk in western Russia, where wildfires were raging at the time.

We can already talk about how the latest extreme events fall in line with trends all over the world – those long-term trends of increasing temperature and increasing heavy precipitation that have been attributed to our impact on the climate system – and we can of course remind the various audiences that in the future, it is very likely that these events are going to be more frequent and intense.
These are general statements that talk about the world as a whole, or at best large regions of the world, and do not pretend to say something specific about Moscow’s and Pakistan’s future heatwaves and floods, their intensity or frequency.
An analysis that is able to drill into the specific events and their causes could not only make us more aware of the effects that our actions have on our local climate, but be the strong basis for saying something about what people on the scorched ground in Moscow, or feet deep in the water in Pakistan, should be prepared to face in a world where greenhouse gases are not kept in check (or not to face, if the result of event attribution concluded that the component from global warming was not significant).
The results from event attribution could thus speak much more cogently to needs for climate change adaptation and mitigation.
I heard some interesting thoughts at the meeting that I would like to close with.
Much talk pertained to the educational value that a sustained activity of event attribution would have, in teaching us about our climate system and the factors affecting its behavior – not only human emissions but urbanization, changes in land use like deforestation and agricultural practices, and natural sources of climate variability like El Nino/La Nina (thanks to Eileen Shea of NOAA for speaking eloquently about this aspect).
Related to this educational value was the observation that transforming information into clear and meaningful messages is not a straightforward task, and that is where expert communicators could help (thanks to Ed Maibach for making this point very effectively).
Another interesting thought was about our inclination as scientists to structure our studies so that we minimize the chances of saying that something “unusual” is going on if in fact nothing besides natural variation is going on.
(This is known in statistical analysis as controlling the chances of a type 1 error, also known as a false positive).
This cautionary choice though does not protect us from the opposite kind of error, and in fact makes its chances higher: we are more prone to conclude that nothing is going on, even when in fact the opposite is true (which is to say, our chances of a type 2 error, or false negative, may be high).
But we know, at this point in time, with high confidence, that we are changing the behavior of the climate system.
We also know that in many cases the error of not detecting that something has changed could have very dire consequences for populations or systems that would be better off adapting to the changing conditions.
When – if ever – should we switch our scientific methods to minimize the false negative rather than the false positive?
(Thanks to Kevin Trenberth of the National Center for Atmospheric Research for his thought-provoking words on this issue)
I don’t see us changing our methodology any time soon, and on the one hand my prudent side as a scientist – and in particular as a statistician-- is comfortable with that thought, but the same thought provokes me to seriously consider the dangers in this attitude, especially when one realizes that as we alter the earth more and more through our collective activities, it becomes more difficult to talk about what is natural climate variability (i.e.
if modern human activities were not taking place on this planet) and what is “forced” behavior, in a system where the two are already inextricably mixed.
Scientists are quite certain that over a period of several million years, increased volcanism can create enough dust and soot to block out sunlight and produce climatic change.
For instance at the end of the Cretaceous period and beginning of the Tertiary (known as the KT boundary) there was increased volcanic activity, with huge volcanic eruptions spewing forth floods of lava.
The Deccan traps in India are an example of K-T boundary ruptures in the Earth's surface, which may have lead to the extinction of dinosaurs.
Volcanic eruptions can contribute to the destruction of stratospheric ozone, and researchers are now suggesting that ice particles containing sulphuric acid from volcanic emissions may contribute to ozone loss.
When chlorine compounds resulting from the break-up of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in the stratosphere are present, the sulphate particles may serve to convert them into more active forms that may cause more rapid ozone depletion.
A further significant impact from large explosive eruptions comes from the conversion of sulphur dioxide (SO2) to sulphuric acid (H2SO4), which condenses rapidly in the stratosphere to form fine sulphate aerosols.
The aerosols increase the reflection of radiation from the Sun back into space and thus cool the Earth's lower atmosphere or troposphere; however, they also absorb heat radiated up from the Earth, thereby warming the stratosphere.
Data from the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE II) instrument on NASA's Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS) have shown that during the first five months after the Mount Pinatubo eruption, the optical depth of the stratospheric aerosol increased up to 100 times in certain locations.
Optical depth is a general measure of the capacity of a region of the atmosphere to prevent the passage of visible light through it.
Greater optical depth means greater blockage of the light.
In this case, the increased optical depth means that considerably less of the sun's energy can get through the cloud to warm the Earth's surface.
People’s mental health and related behaviour, is positively or negatively influenced by both external social and climate factors.
According to the World Health Organisation, mental health problems are set to increase significantly by the year 2020, and will be the second greatest cause of illness after heart disease by 2050 if present trends continue.
A rapid change in climate is likely to influence and increase mental health issues.
This is will be especially evident in the case of climate-related natural hazards, where property losses and displacement from residences can cause significant psychological stress, with long-lasting effects on anxiety levels and depression.
It is known that social disruptions resulting from family and community dislocations due to extreme weather events pose a special stress for children and those of lower socio-economic status.
For instance, many in the New Orleans medical community think that Hurricane Katrina is still killing.
Health experts say that survivors of the fierce storm are dying from the effects of both psychological and physical stress.
People are now dying from the dust and mould in housing, from financial problems and are deeply disturbed by fear of crime.
Further studies in 2007 show that about half of adult New Orleans residents suffered from anxiety and mood disorders months after Hurricane Katrina devastated the city, a higher rate than after most natural disasters.
Depression, panic disorders, and post-traumatic stress were diagnosed in 49 percent of New Orleans residents surveyed five to seven months after the storm struck on August 29, 2005, a study found.
"Given that human mental health is a state of being that is both affected by and affects the world in which we live, the link between mental health (what we think, feel, believe and ultimately do) and climate change is critical if we are to achieve positive change.
Currently western ways of thinking and doing perpetuate the illusion that we are not an integral part of a planetary system, but rather above and in control of it.
Human well-being – indeed survival - is likely to be very limited if this world view does not change.
" (Andrew Lyon and Maddy Halliday, 2005, Climate Change and Mental Health in the 21st Century, International Futures Forum)

As the science of climate change becomes more widely known, we are entering a period of angst where the reality of climatic system collapse is accepted, yet the search for climate solutions lags.
One dispute is to what extent individuals must sacrifice modern conveniences to reduce emissions; such as driving less, eating less meat and many other energy conserving activities; or whether the required necessary changes are of such a scale like public mass transit, global carbon caps and a carbon tax, which can only be carried out by governments.
Given we must reduce emissions dramatically, by some 60% and perhaps more as soon as possible, the answer is both.
I am very disappointed in Tony Blair's recent statement that we should all carry on with our air travel because science will find an answer to the problem.
The hard reality is that some degree of personal sacrifice is going to be required .
Additionally, emissions cannot get to their required levels without rich nations dramatically cutting their emissions and allowing poor nations to increase to equal levels.
This approach is called contract and converge [search] .
I am shamed every time President Bush selfishly says America will not set mandatory emissions caps because developing countries refuse to do so immediately, when our emissions are up to 30 times that of poor nations.
Climate solutions require that emissions must be reduced equitably, both personally and by governments.
Work like the dickens to reduce your own carbon footprint while joining the people's movement to bring about societal change sufficient to achieve long-term, equitable and just global ecological sustainability.
hey my name is cody ingram im a 16 year old teenager who is very concerned about global warming and the efforts to reduce the green house gases i was wondering what effect the kyoto accord and other efforts are having ok the reduction of green house gases and what the usa actually plans to do because i have noticed that george bush is good at sitting on his ass and doing nothing about important problems so i wanna hear what he has planned to do if anything
Ironies: 1) The UK Met Office has recently projected 2007 to be the hottest year on record for global temperatures.
2) The U.S. govt is a) considering putting the polar bear on the endangered species list; b) NOAA reports 2006 as the hottest year on record in the continental U.S.
There are enough experts out there (and I am not talking about armchair 'experts' like me, but professors of meteorology, geophysics and so forth) who dispute that mankind-generated CO2 has anything to do with global warming.
They make very strong arguments for the current warming to be simply part of natural cycles.
They say we should concentrate on coping strategies rather than on quixotic and pointless efforts to reduce CO2 emissions which may contribute next to nothing to global warming.
Although the 'received wisdom' is such that mankind truly is to blame, I am not yet convinced
im a teenager also, been doing some research for a paper im doing on the topic.
all of the actual scientific sites ive visited have said the same thing as he has; that global warming is gonna happen, but it isn't the "evil US" 's fault that it is happening.
cars have gotta be at least 50% more effective than they were originally, and the precautions taken nowadays are still incredible.
the "little ice age" was named for a reason.
it was COLD.
my guess is we're probably just still recovering from that.
i remember my seventh grade science teacher (one of the smartest people I ever met) and my freshman bio teacher (a science GENIUS who runs a toxins company and has a habit of traveling to greece and austria) both said we were stll coming out of an ice age.
lastly, if the people of the middle ages survived it, so can we.
they had no CLUE what global warming is and the human race survived that.
RESPONSE: The basis of contract and converge is that we need and equitable global average per capita emissions level for the rich and poor.
People striving to meet basic needs may need and deserve more emissions to get to that level in order to be fair.
Their contribution to global warming has been miniscule.
So yes, the developed world needs to cut emissions dramatically, perhaps as much as 90% so that the poor world can improve their lot with slight increases in emissions.
The sum total would still be the required 60% reductions; but in a more just and fair world.
Hi, I've been reading your blog with interest.
There is a very cheap and simple way in which every household can make a 50% to 70% reduction in their use of cooking fuel and thereby help in the fight against global climate change.
It doesn't need time and rocket science to implement.
The very basic, cheap and simple technlogy already exists and everyone everywhere in the world can use it.
Please find out how by checking out tp://www.cookinginabasket.blogspot.co
Sorry but you are wrong.
There are no real scientists left that doubt global warming is caused by the increase GHG level.
Some suggest it's already too late to take action and that we should be focussing on coping strategies.
Even if you refuse to accept the overwhelming scientific consensus on the relationship between atmospheric CO2 and global warming, you have forgotten one indisputable result of increased CO2 - ocean acidification (carbonic acid from carbon dioxide dissolving in H2O).
At current rates of increase of CO2 emissions (i.e.
a "business as usual" scenario, not even considering the likelihood that coal becomes the primary energy source for most of the world as cheap petroleum supplies are exhausted), and given the already measured changes in PH in the world's oceans, they will become biological deserts (save small areas at the poles) later this century.
Since oceans play a key role (perhaps the most important role) as carbon sinks, you might consider that we'll get bit in the ass one way or another.
Not to mention the little problem of no fish!
That's assuming you are not getting your basic information from the Competitive Enterprise Institute site or one of Exxon/Mobil's lackeys.
See 11/20/06 The New Yorker for a summary of the science and interviews with numerous ocean researchers.
However, I cannot ignore the signatories on this letter to the Canadian govt about Kyoto (link below).
I can imagine that they are wrong, but not 'obviously' so, as pro-climate change bloggers like yourself seem to think.
I also find it a little difficult to accept the conspiracy theory that all the signatories must be in the pocket of 'Big Oil'.
Imagine, you are a professor of earth sciences and believe that mankind is responsible for global warming...would you really allow a 'pay-off' from Exxon to put your reputation on the line by lying?
And not only you but scores of other professors of meteorology, environmental sciences and so on?
No, although they might be wrong, there are enough contrary voices to at least accept that it is not cut and dried
No one takes into consideration on global warming, the effect that the testing and actual barbaric use of the atom bombs, I once witnessed via an army film, the dropping and effect of the bomb, if you watch the clouds during the formation of the mushroom they are in termoil, god knows what these terrible weapons have done to this beautiful planet.
When they tell you it is the human race that has caused the Global Warming, just remind them of the Atom Bomb Effect!
Note these are names taken from around the world and there only 60.
Many are well known climate skeptics funded by big Oil and Coal.
Many are just economists.
should publish it.
So far the climate skeptics have been proven wrong time and time again.
That's why they debate in the media not in the scientific community.
I recognize quite a few of the names (for example, Patrick Michael) as the "same old crowd" of climate change deniers.
And, yes, sorry to say that many of them do receive grants, directly or indirectly, from Exxon/Mobil and their oil industry brethren.
All of this has been documented over the last few years, quite well in fact, by Ross Gelbspan and numerous others.
The effectiveness of Exxon's "investment" in a long-term disinformation campaign is obvious - it convinced you (and people I know well, unfortunately, until I pointed out to them that this was in fact a deliberate campaign)!
As a resident of the Pacific Northwest, I can tell you that George Taylor, listed as Oregon's state climatologist, has little or no credibility in the field of climate science and, although he has a degree in meteorology, he can't even seem to forecast regional weather very well!
.....So far the climate skeptics have been proven wrong time and time again.
That's why they debate in the media not in the scientific community.....
Listen, nobody who's been paying attention to what the climate researchers are trying to tell us is just waiting with bated breath for every opportunity to spread Bad News.
Informed, concerned people don't ENJOY "scaring" their fellow human beings as some would have us believe.
The "talking points" of the "no way could our excessive release of gaseous CO2 could possibly effect the atmosphere" people (aka greenhouse theory is some lefty take over the world ploy) are numerous and unrelenting.
I recently wrote an article for a local paper and couldn't believe some of the more vehement "anti" responses.
Anyway, I don't want to get into pissing matches with the ney-sayers but recognize that occaisionally a dignified response is needed.
Here is a link to help you all out in arguing with that pesky uncle who thinks global warming is a bunch of tree-hugging nonsense
Start with the changes you can do right now, and make a real difference in your life.
Then encourage everyone you know to make the same changes in their lives, and lobby your leaders *hard* for firm environmental legislation.
- Get educated and become politically active.
Let your leaders know that climate change is real, and doing nothing is *not* an option.
- Share what you know.
Get involved in your community with like-minded people.
plant trees.
Protect endangered species and lands.
Fight for the planet and for your inheritance - clean air, clean water, and a healthy planet.
David, the letter below ought to push you over the edge toward realizing that AGW is real.
The letter you cite was written in reaction to this letter signed by 90 (!
) of the leading climate scientists in Canada.
And--news flash!--George Bush is expected finally to acknowledge AGW in his State of the Union address later this month, and the need to do something about it.
Finally, ExxonMobile has finally decided to cut funding to the denialists.
Coolest days on record in Los Angelesâ€¦ Interesting how you never hear reports on the news regarding global warming when "records lows" are occurring.
I just CAN NOT believe in this global warming BS until there is some actual long-standing definitive evidence that this is not cycle related and it is unbelievably unprofessional for any "scientist" to state the opposite while the "proof" seems far from proven.
You seem like a sincere, level-headed individual.
All I can say is to suggest that you take some time to read some of the actual literature coming out of the climate-research community rather than focusing exclusively on what you read in the news media.
When I see, as I have seen for the last few years, infants and little children anxiously twisting around in their strollers trying to avoid direct sunlight in their eyes while their parents are standing by and yakking on their cell phones, oblivious; when I hear about crop failure in an already poor country due to ridiculously excessive precipitation following an extended period of drought; when I see spring flowers blooming in Boston in December; when I hear that polar bear females are struggling to maintain body weight sufficient to reproduce successfully â€“ and so on â€“ I have to wonder how it is that human beings can know of these things and not be moved.
How can they not be affected?
How can they not instinctively want to more closely observe these situations and consider what can be done about them?
Ten years ago I could have stomached comments like yours but now it's just a little too much.
What is your proof for your skepticism, a letter from 60 climate skeptics and you don't like the quasi-religious certainty of the people posting here.
Well congrats you've really done your research.
Fine you don't like the responses here, well get off your lazy butt and do your own research.
Ooii, such crying, such complaining, such bitching and moaning I am hearing.
And mostly for naught, I'm thinking.
Global warming is not going to cause the human race to go extinct.
It's estimated that only about 90% of us will die.
That leaves 10 % of us to go forth and populate the earth.
Maybe we'll do it smarter next time.
The problem with global warming, as I see it, is not that civilization (?
) as we know it is going to die, but rather, whether as a particular individual I am or you are going to die.
When that happens, the process is more or less irreversable.
The answer to global warming is to survive it on a personal level.
I say personal, because government has already proven itself to be incompetent.
Do the names Katrina or Rita mean anything to you?
Does the war in Iraq give you a clue?
If you want to be a part of the 10%, you need to quit complaining and start acting in your own narrow and selfish best interest.
In my nearly seven decades upon this vail of tears, I have noticed that the goddess helps them what helps themselves.
Since I'm fairly certain that unless time just flat runs out on me, I will survive global warming, climate change and society's breakdown, let me share my thoughts on what you can do, on a personal level to get through this thing.
It's basicaly to live your life as I have lived mine for the past half century.
As I'm typing this, I'm sitting across the room from my heatalator.
There is a wood fire burning in it.
My house is toastey warm.
I felled and split five trees for firewood back in the early spring.
How very non-environmentally aware I am.
Not at all, because this year as I've done every year for as long as I can remember, I've planted two dozen acorns.
They don't all make it to trees, but there are many more trees on my place than there were when I bought the place.
My carbon footprint for heat is negative.
i think that canadas govrement should say yes to the global warming clean up because right now they dont want to do it is because it is all about darn money these days so if u want to save money to spend on hospitals and other crap and ur gonna die what the heck is the friggen point stupid goverment ....
No PeterW, the debate is far from over.
You expect me, and everyone else, to accept a major, major claim just because the consensus is such?
Well, that is not the way I operate.
As an agnostic, I will not believe in God simply because there is a consensus of theologians who say He exists...I explore the arguments for and against.
I will not simply accept that passive smoking kills, when the evidence suggests otherwise, yet guess what, there is a pretty strong consensus that it does.
Nor will I believe in the doom-and-gloom simply because a host of climate scientists with computer models say so...because many other climate scientists disagree.
No David the peer reviewed climate scientists don't disagree.
That's what the IPCC process is all about.
The hacks and has beens may disagree, but they don't publish peer-reviewed scientific papers.
They bitch in the media.
You obviously know very little about climate science if you think it's just computer models.
Don't complain to me, or ask me to educate you.
If you really want to understand go to RealClimate.org.
or read one of the many excellent books that explain the subject.
David!
It isn't just about who or what is causing global heating.
Even if climate wasn't changing, we have a huge eco-crisis on our hands...
Forget reducing emissions and just look at... soil loss, species habitat destruction, pollution of air sea sky soil and flesh, dropping oxygen levels, rising forest destruction, war, famine, disease, slavery... etc etc.... There are a multitude of terrible things affecting our living earth right now, and one way or another they all boil down to the same common cause - our species has run amok and particularlu the white western nations have been running amok for generations and the solutions to all the problems which face the human race, which funnily enough does not consist mostly of wealthy americans!
would more or less be the same.
OK, Kerry Martin, I know when I'm not wanted.
I'll bid you adieu.
But first, to your question, What more can you do?
The answer, since global warming is, in all probability, the result of natural cycles, is "Nothing!
" Fasten your seatbelt and enjoy the ride that is life, whatever it throws in your path.
You are on this planet in order that your soul can experience what it's like to be clothed in physical matter - not to wring your hands and ruin your day over things way out of your ken or control - Farewell!
Let us begin to with-hold a significant proportion of our taxes from them until they agree to scrap those kind of idiotic and unsustainable plans and projects, and begin instead to (for example) massively subsidise public transport, solar panels, wood-not-concrete for building, etc.
etc.
Whereby concerned citizens still pay all the taxes due to their governments, but lodge them, or a proportion of them, into a legally established Climate Change Action Holding Fund â€“ This stores the taxes, so that taxes can be seen to have been â€œpaidâ€ by the individual, but effectively with-holds finance from the governments until such time as the individual is satisfied that the government has taken the actions required.
I read somewhere, someone calling for the "development of a technology to take CO2 out of the atmosphere and bury it"
Preventing further forest/soil loss must be just as important as reducing emissions.
Building soil and planting trees is a positive action.
One thing that people can actually DO.
Small scale and large scale.
Rich or poor.
There are simple techniques for reforesting even very desert places.
I hear that forests are dying from pests no longer held back by climate.
It must be a priority to see that these areas are replanted with suitable species able to cope with the new conditions coming...
Identifying and breeding fast-growing drought-resistant food-producing tree & shrub speciesâ€¦ Learning how to propogate them prolifically, knowing where, when & how to plant and nurture them.
That is the sort of thing we need to know.
Not just governments.
Multi-nationals can be put under a lot more pressure.
Monsanto could do something USEFUL for us, help us with new varieties of shrubs and trees able to produce food under the new conditions... Most people can actually live without Coca-cola, so a boycott of Coca-cola the drink would make Coca-Cola the multi-national behave more sustainably with drinking water perhapsâ€¦
My E-mail is kerryemartin@hotmail.com if anyone would like to comment or encourage me to take these ideas further.
Thankyou. Posted 23rd January to climate ark and countercurrents.
I am 46 single freelance female now living in Co.Kerry, Eire.
I was born in Australia and reared in the South-East of England.
My dad is a research biologist & naturalist now living back in Australia.
I dropped out of the official study of Environmental Science in 1979 in order to live up a mountain and radically reduce my ecological footprint to as near zero as possible.
This is actually great fun to do, and nowhere near as difficult or miserable as mollycoddled westerners think it is!
I am back in the middle of a small town now â€“ but without the consumer lifestyle - as I realised eventually that with galloping global heating, my solitary potato patch was doomed, and that the survival of all that I love is much more likely if I put my energy & talents into political activity at this time.
I am very behind the times with technology as all this computer internet mobile phone stuff happened while I was up the mountain eating weeds.
I don't want to join any existing political party but desire deeply to somehow mobilise the whole human race to become confidently bold and radical in rising to meet this challenge.
I am said to be â€œbi-polarâ€, actually quite sane, not taking any pharmecutical medication and consequently have â€œdelusions of grandeurâ€ that I believe I can achieve with a lot of help from my friends.
Eg. EARTH AID DAY - Bigger, better, bolder than Band Aid & actually works!
)
why do soo many people polute litter ans soo on I think it is soo wrong and global warming I am just getting started why use soo much energy in the air when you cn reduce using all this energy suckers
The tightening of the Brazilian ethanol market for use as a biofuel clearly demonstrates there is no way enough biomass could ever be grown to meet a significant portion of current, much less anticipated, world energy needs without causing great environmental harm.
Biofuels "fight for space in the environment, they fight food production... [t]hey are not the answer to the energy crisis.
" Locally produced biofuels may help move local economies towards relocalized sustainability, but on the international agro-industrial scale which they are being proposed they are certain to further degrade land and water ecosystems without appreciably contributing to solving the energy and climate crises.
Biofuels can be done badly, for sure, and they are only a piece of the puzzle.
But cellulose based biofuels do have potential for replacing a significant amount of petroleum, with actual environmental improvements.
By replacing wheat and soy with switchgrass, a native perennial grass, we could dramatically reduce water and chemical use as well as erosion, while producing both protein for animal feed as well as fuels.
Scenarios for this by the Role of Biomass in America's Energy Future project are outlined in the NRDC paper, "Growing Energy," as well as my on paper, "The New Harvest," www.ef.org/biofuels.
Going even further than those scenarios, which envision a fleet of 50 mpg cars, a fleet of plug-in hybrids, we hope using wind, solar, wave and tidal electricity, could run most of the time on electricity and use liquid biofuels as a supplement.
Of course, at the same time, we need to make driving less necaessary by re-designing our communities.
That is a longer term process.
Im afraid, the cold heart fact's are, that nothing will ever replace cheap oil pumped out of the ground.
The concept of growing our energy, on a planet that is in the mist of a massive climate change is insane.
We dont even know if will have a bread basket region in 10 year's.
With the world Democracie's needing a 3% increase in energy every year to survive, where is this going to come from.
Again we are avoiding the issue, it's conservation on a mass scale.
Bye Bye 13 mile a gallon S.U.V.s or 8 mile a gallon R.V.s .
It's time we face the cold heart fact's that the cheap ride is over.
We guzzeled oil like it was water, like their was an endless supply.
We knew this was coming in the 70's.. What did we do ...Hummer's was our answer.
Hemi - Truck's was our answer.
Now people complain about ( High Gas Price's )give me a break !
. Now every Tom , Dick , and Harry has a hair brain scheme to solve this problem...were 20 year's to late.
Just like Global warming we need to see cat 5 Hurricane's as a norm and citie's wiped off the face of this earth.
To say somthing's wrong ,when we were warned.
We created these problem's ( Now World Deal with them )and stop looking for short cut's because their are none.
I would like to comment on what Patrick Mazza writes.
Growing energy crops must mean either a displacement of food production or global expansion of agriculture.
There really is no way round this.
And there is just no way either can be sustainable, not when crops are coming under ever greater pressure from climate change already.
Of course, we must capture energy from organic, including agricultural waste, and it would be wonderful to help the two billion people who completely rely on biofuels today to grow them efficiently, rather than having to destroy their forests and losing their health, education and food in the process.
And, by the way, the World Food Programme have just cut rations to famine-victims in East Africa in half, below survival levels, because the US and Europe failed to donate enough grain.
Any link with us burning some of our food in our cars now?
I don't know - but an ethical dilemma all the same.
Maybe we should start thinking about our energy and environmental concerns by eliminating the combustion engine.
There seems to be a growing possibility of fuel cells actually being allowed to compete with combustion engines in the automotive sector.
The arguement of energy source and quantity, in regards to environmental issues, might be different if actual energy efficiency were increased from 20 -40% efficient (across the board) to an average of 40 -60%.
With diminished pollutants or cyclical Co2 production.
Just a thought.
As of 2007 the Earth System has already undergone profound Global Change [search] of which Global Heating is the most immediately evident impact.
It is getting hot , and it is happening fast.
Humanity is deeply within the Anthropocene era [search] whereby our presence is the greatest force shaping the biosphere.
And the results are already being shown to be calamitous - floods and droughts, crop failures, vegetation die-back, rising seas and a general breakdown of climatic patterns.
Don't believe me?
Walk outside right now - see or feel anything different?
Are the trees blooming like in Washington D.C. ? Is there a lack of snow as in Minnesota and Europe ?
Are the rains failing as with Australia's "Big Dry" [search] ?
This is no time for moderation .
So much of the global ecological system's processes and patterns which provide the life-giving context for human civilization have been lost and changed, and it continues to intensify.
Essentially no natural processes are assured as a very different Planet emerges - climate patterns, water supplies, ocean fisheries, soil fertility, terrestrial ecosystem energy and nutrient cycling.
Only massive public and political pressure - now - can save the Earth and all her species.
Thank you Glen, you are communicating with the unscientific, but humanely passionate delivery of a sleep-walker who awakes stood atop a precipitous drop, and I hear your cry for the public to change the political direction, but how?
Those who would listen already have.
The task now is to find a way to force those who choose not to listen to recieve the message; "It's not just your world", the most complicated part of which is the principle that the behaviour of others WILL effect them whether they want it to or not.
Will they see the connection between no snow this year and a 'silent spring' the next?
We could (and did) stop DDT before mass extinctions ensued, because we didn't pass a tipping point, just an awareness thresh-hold.
However, with climate change now in break-away mode, and public opinion so unrepresented in the media, we need new ideas to affect policy change.
Can anyone help?
What more can we do?
"Reflecting on 2006, I recall only that it rained.
And blew.And froze.And then it rained some more.Although I am constantly on at my kids about the paucity of their vocabulary, the truth is that Wellington's weather was crap.
Yes,there are other words for it, but crap is the best one.
The bad weather seemed to dominate all else.Wellingtonions take pride in the fortitude with which they withstand the weather.
The constant refrain in the Capital is that "You can't beat Wellington on a good day", Which simply means that on the other 364 days almost anywhere else in the World would be better.
This year,though,I have been ready to throw in the towel.If my husband's job did not tie us to the Capital, I would be ready to pack up and go at the slightest hint of a job opportunity in the pleasant climes of Anchorage or Tierra del Fuego.
A friend has likened tolerating Wellington's climate to sticking in a relationship with a man who really isn't good enough.And so you put up with the bad behaviour and the staying out late or,in the case of the weather,THE RELENTLESS SOUTHERLIES,Happiness is sapped away and you instinctively walk hunched over, trying to preserve your core body temperature despite the elements.
You are slowly ground down, carrying a polar fleece at all times, accustomed to only seeing umbrellas broken and up-ended in rubbish tins.
Each morning you turn on the radio news to find out in which Wellington suburbs homes have slid down the hillsides overnight.
The author who is ready "To throw in the towel" does not make a connection to climate change, not realising that Wellington's weather has worsened compared to previous decades.
Unfortunately, we are all really waiting for others to provide the solution to global warming, while going on our own merry (and profligate) way.
Here are some suggestions for your new planet-saving lifestyle, while you wait for government action on the matter:
d)get rid of that air-conditioner and make use of more natural cooling methods if you live in a hot climate.
Similarly, if you live in a cold climate, use better insulation and warm clothing rather than central heating.
Are you going to do any of these things?
Of course not!
So, stop whinging and don't complain if others do nothing either.
People won't believe in global warming until they see the West Antarctic Ice Sheet collapse with their own eyes.
If humans can affect the Earth's climate in 100 years accidentally then it should be NO problem to terrafom Mars (a smaller planet) if we would really try!
Right? NOT.
People, there are so many factors that contribute to our climate that no one has the answers yet.
Some new factors being investgated which need to be taken into account are cosmic radiation, sun cycles, Earth's 21 year orbit fluctuations, natural thermal events, etcâ€¦ By the way Mars' polar caps are shrinking tooâ€¦I am sure it is Bush's fault.
Oh yeah, back around 900 when it was very wam on Greenland and in Wurope I am sure an antcedent of Bush did that tooâ€¦.
WACKOS!!!
This represents an all-too-typical example of the unfortunate connection in the US between climate change issues and partisan politics.
In Western Europe and the rest of the developed world, which lack the petro-funded fog machine that has influenced the media in the US for decades, people understand that our species has a serious problem on our hands.
The Conservative opposition in the UK is falling all over itself to support greenhouse emissions control measures, because the people demand that they respond with serious policy proposals.
In the US, dittoheads like elk delude themselves into thinking that melting polar ice caps are a "natural" cycle, because that's what they are being fed by their feckless leaders.
Word to the wise, elk.
Pretty soon Bush will be irrelevant, and you will have to accept the fact that even Republicans will be forced to craft policy responses to climate change if they are to remain viable as a political party in the US.
If we are REALLY going to "fix" the global warming planet we are going to have to have abolish the automobile as we know it.
We need the U.N., Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch to step up and demand that we move to road blockades to limit traffic until it can be FULLY haulted, we are going to have to do something about the cow flatulance poisoning our atmosphere and eventually....we are going to have to bring in the blue helmets to take over China, India and Japan to decimate their industrial infrastructure.
We are slaves to the international corporations who aren't just trying to produce products and make a living but are actively working to destroy the ozone with their cars, cows and hair spray.
Why doesn't anyone care?
I am crying so hard while I write this.....When will the world unite to bring down those destroying out planet.
Read an article from Stephen Hawking the other day.
He thinks we're past the point of no return in an interview July 06.
Essentially, with no snow and ice left to reflect the sun's rays the earth will eventually get hotter and hotter in an unstoppable cycle.
He's a pretty smart guy and it scares me.
I've got 2 kids.
How much time we talking here?
Can they plan any kind of future?
What Hawkings said is half true.
The Earth is warming up and melting the polar ice caps.
However, this will lead us into the next ice age.
Becuase we have saline oceans which drives the ocean conveyer belt, (this circulates the planet and keeps us warm the UK wouldnt have the gulfsteam otherwise) and the polar ice caps are fresh water.
As the sun heats up the Earth its melting the polar ice caps which is slowing the ocean conveyer down due to the fact that saline water is more dence than fresh water when the conveyer belt stops we are in the next ice age.
However i personally think we will run out of oil before this happens which will leave most of the world in a real crisis.
i have more to say...if we keep living the way we are now we are not going to survive im only 17 years old and by the time i am 40 somthing most of the earth will be flooded...more hurricains and tornadoes will be coming in places they have never seen before...i dont have any kids i am one my self and i already see the world comin to an end because of the way we live and treat our earth...so many animals are dieing and no ones being able to see them as often...expecially polar bears they are finding them dead because the ice caps are melting and the bears can swim that far to climb on the next ice cap that is also melting and cant hold the bears weight, and they need the ice caps to survive in our world...i suggest to watch the movie "an inconvienient truth" its a very good movie it explains alot about the globel and what will happen if we dont stop the globel warming(very good movie) also "day after tomorrow" things that happend in that movie will also happen to us but worse because its not reality but its pretty close to what is going to happen and we are going to have another ice age...they say 100 years but the way we keep living it i think will be so much sooner...thanks for letting me type and as for bush...i dont know why people voted for him he dont care about the environment!!!!
MAYBE YOU SHOULD ALL START THINKING ABOUT IT ALL YOU POLITICS PEOPLE WILL VOTE FOR YOU IF YOU ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE GLOBEL WARMING!!!
!

Fighting Fires on the Cheap and Ignoring Climate Change by John/Togs Tognolini
Looking at the haze of smoke, covering the Blue Mountains from the bushfires, 700 kilometres away to the south in Gippsland Victoria.
I thought of the Country Fire Authority fire fighter I met in the Victorian Alps, when he said, â€This fire isn't going to stop until it hits the ocean.
(The coast was over 120 kilometres from where we were talking.
)â€ I was at those fires in late November, before that the Blue Mountains were on fire for 15 days.
The 8,000 hectares that was burnt here, pales in comparison to the 800,000 hectares that has so far been burnt in Victoria.
Both fires were started by lightning strikes.
Both fires are burning over bush dried out by one of the longest droughts in Australian history.
Both the drought and the dry storms that bought the lighting strikes are a result of Climate Change.
While 2006 was recorded as one of the hottest years ever, 2007 has already been predicted to be even hotter.
Australia along with United States has not signed the Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change, reflecting the federal government's inaction.
Prime minister John Howard does say Climate Change exist but puts forward the fantasy of clean coal technology and the nightmare of nuclear power and its waste.
He is more concerned about Australia's markets from coal and uranium mining, than using clean renewable energy sources such wave, wind and solar technology.
He along with all the state ALP governments has refused to build key infrastructure such as public transport, railways, tram/light rail and extended ferry services, placing car and trucks with their greenhouse emissions as the major form of transport.
Also evident in both fires was the reluctance of many experienced volunteer bush fire fighters not to step up and fight the fires.
They were and are fearful they won't have a job to come back to when they return from a fire fighting shift.
Reflecting how anti-community Howard's Work Choice legislation is.
It's reprehensible for Volunteers to be sacked after they have put their life on the line, protecting communities and vital public assets such as our National Parks.
The fires reflect not only Climate Change but also the need for regime change in Canberra.
If we take Katrina and its affect on New Orleans and the lack of emergency relief and disaster mismanagement, Australia isn't that bad, but with these fires and cyclone Larry in North Queensland, there's vast room for improvement and tackling the root cause of these environmental disasters Climate Change.
This night we had the 2nd storm during the week and tomorrow Sunday 13th the weather forecasters say another hurricane will hit us.
This winter in scandinavia has been extremely mild and stormy - I have stopped counting the storms; it's never been like this before.
I am afraid for the future.
Meanwhile, climate change simply must become the dominant issue in the 2008 presidential election.
If not, it will be time for thinking men and women to prepare whatever ark they can put afloat.
Here in Eire we are not having a winter... Developers are going crazy felling native woodlands to throw up utterly unsustainable mansions at sea level for gods sake and everyone is queing up to buy huge 4wds and joking about being the new costa del sol.
Nobody around me seems to care about the future in any sane sense.
They are drunk on money.
There is no serious coverage of the crisis in the media.
The population is oblivious.
I am spooked... We are not having a winter.
The rain has changed.
It is heavy.
I haven't seen good old soft irish rain for ages... Kerry is a little micro-climate never too hot and never too cold.
Last summer we fried alive.
The native flora and fauna that is!
The tourists of course loved it!
I am spooked.
I want to suggest to the justifiably worried youth of our countries, and to Sir Bob Geldof & everyone who remembers the power of Live Aid twenty years ago... that it's time we got organised again and stage EARTH AID DAY please... maybe sometime next year, or year after and meantime and do loads of research into ALL the ways we can all sensibly help - soil building, tree planting, water harvesting, getting celebrities to make vows like Elton vowing to dress in monks robes for the rest of his life and give the money he saves to Sub-saharan desert halting permaculture projects etc.etc.
Most of the humans who will suffer first from global heating don't even know why it is happening.
The Third World will be devestated.
Emergency Food Aid isn't enough.
ECO-SYSTEM RESTORATION is what is needed and rechannelling military monies and personnel into this would/could/might pull us back from the brink.
I am 46 single freelance female now living in Co.Kerry, Eire.
I was born in Australia and reared in the South-East of England.
My dad is a research biologist & naturalist now living back in Australia.
I dropped out of the official study of Environmental Science in 1979 in order to live up a mountain and radically reduce my ecological footprint to as near zero as possible.
This is actually great fun to do, and nowhere near as difficult or miserable as mollycoddled westerners think it is!
I am back in the middle of a small town now â€“ but without the consumer lifestyle - as I realised eventually that with galloping global heating, my solitary potato patch was doomed, and that the survival of all that I love is much more likely if I put my energy & talents into political activity at this time.
I am very behind the times with technology as all this computer internet mobile phone stuff happened while I was up the mountain eating weeds.
I don't want to join any existing political party but desire deeply to somehow mobilise the whole human race to become confidently bold and radical in rising to meet this challenge.
I am said to be â€œbi-polarâ€, actually quite sane, not taking any pharmecutical medication and consequently have â€œdelusions of grandeurâ€ that I believe I can achieve with a lot of help from my friends.
Eg. EARTH AID DAY - Bigger, better, bolder than Band Aid & actually works!

Let us begin to with-hold a significant proportion of our taxes from them until they agree to scrap those kind of idiotic and unsustainable plans and projects, and begin instead to (for example) massively subsidise public transport, solar panels, wood-not-concrete for building, etc.
etc.
Whereby concerned citizens still pay all the taxes due to their governments, but lodge them, or a proportion of them, into a legally established Climate Change Action Holding Fund â€“ This stores the taxes, so that taxes can be seen to have been â€œpaidâ€ by the individual, but effectively with-holds finance from the governments until such time as the individual is satisfied that the government has taken the actions required.
I read somewhere, someone calling for the "development of a technology to take CO2 out of the atmosphere and bury it"
Preventing further forest/soil loss must be just as important as reducing emissions.
Building soil and planting trees is a positive action.
One thing that people can actually DO.
Small scale and large scale.
Rich or poor.
There are simple techniques for reforesting even very desert places.
I hear that forests are dying from pests no longer held back by climate.
It must be a priority to see that these areas are replanted with suitable species able to cope with the new conditions coming...
Identifying and breeding fast-growing drought-resistant food-producing tree & shrub speciesâ€¦ Learning how to propogate them prolifically, knowing where, when & how to plant and nurture them.
That is the sort of thing we need to know.
Not just governments.
Multi-nationals can be put under a lot more pressure.
Monsanto could do something USEFUL for us, help us with new varieties of shrubs and trees able to produce food under the new conditions... Most people can actually live without Coca-cola, so a boycott of Coca-cola the drink would make Coca-Cola the multi-national behave more sustainably with drinking water perhapsâ€¦
My E-mail is kerryemartin@hotmail.com if anyone would like to comment or encourage me to take these ideas further.
Thankyou. Posted 23rd January to climate ark and countercurrents.
It is not just fossil fuels causing global warming; microwaves cause heat by jiggling water molecules.
Microwaves emitted by cell towers are measurable by a microwave tester.
Cell towers supposedly have a legal range of between 580 and 1000 microwatts per square centimeter (mW/cm2), the highest in the world, and the radiation from a cell tower is picked up by cell phones.
While they are on, the radiation is in the hundreds of mW/cm2.
Multiply this by the hundreds of cell towers in your locality and by the thousands in the country, and millions worldwide, and I believe it is enough radiation to contribute to global warming.
Thankfully in our constant climate news tracking we are noting less debate about climate change's existence and proposing of dangerous half-measures, and more scientists, citizens and policy-makers proposing dramatic efforts to cut emissions as fast and as much as possible.
For example in a recent speech Al Gore made brave and substantive proposals [ more ] for an immediate freeze on carbon dioxide emissions and elimination of payroll taxes in favor of pollution taxes - both are not politically easy, but are imaginative and at the scale required to solve the problem.
And a Stanford University conference notes that humanity has 500 to 1000 years of fossil fuel, mostly coal, that could be burned.
"China alone is building the equivalent of a Manhattan every year and a large coal-fired power plant every week.
" They propose moving to a "massively carbonless" future by 2050 through increased energy efficiency and massive renewable energy developments.
It is vital that these and other measures that are sufficient to actually address and solve the climate crisis are carefully debated, developed and implemented now.
As a young man, growing up in Siberia setting fires on thawing permafrost was a favorite past-time.
Then, little did I know, these flames were burning methane and I had stumbled on to a contribution to Global Warming, an indication of how the world could end.
In the U.S., I joined the Preventech Foundation the developers of technologies preventing Global Warming.
We submitted these technologies to the authorities, but received no response.
Finally, the article in Fresno Bee by Seth Borenstein AP (09/07/06) might convince the Public, that there is no escape from Global Warming.
So, we have submitted this technology again!
As you may have guessed â€“ no response!
History repeats itself â€“ for example, the technology of â€motioncodes' which would makes the 9/11 terrorists attack impossible, was submitted one year before 9/11, but again no response!
It is generally acknowledged that the solutions offered to counter climate change are woefully inadequate.
We might just begin to seriously address climate change by decreasing "consumption".
This can be realistically implemented first in the developed democracies of the West.
As consumption in the West accounts for most of the world consumption of manufactured products and services, an effective policy of reducing consumption is to introduce birth control with a target of, say halfing the the Western countries' poulation by 2080.
By doing so, we would have seriously decreased carbon emmisssion to a scale which might just be sufficient to avert the looming crisis.
Such a radical but realistic policy coupled with gradual boycot of the products of high poluting companies - starting with Western companies which have shifted their production to India, China and other developing SE Asian countries, where they can polute at will - will send a strong and effective message that the high consumer society will only consume clean energy products.
It will also force policy makers in these developing regions to adopt similar polices if they are to attract the hard currency which they so badly need and stay in the global market.
BACK IN 2003, one of us (Daudpota) signed an email petition titled the Siachen Peace Park Initiative located at the glacier that bears this name.
It had to do with getting India and Pakistan to withdraw from the futile conflict in the mountains and to let nature revert to its snowy tranquillity.
"As part of the normalisation process/confidence-building measures, the governments of India and Pakistan are urged to establish a Siachen Peace Park to protect and restore the spectacular landscapes which are home to so many endangered species including the snow leopard.
" This was the statement adopted as a lead-up to the 5th World Parks Congress held in September 2003 in Durban, South Africa.
But new strongly worded reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released on February 2 this year could perhaps make the decision-makers change their minds about this wasteful, futile conflict.
The IPCC forecasts that global temperatures would rise by 1.8 degrees Celsius to 4 degrees Celsius this century.
There are already signs that South Asia will be one of the worst affected regions â€” the monsoon could be affected with reduced agriculture production, the sinking of island communities is likely, and vector-borne diseases could increase.
According to M.N.
Kaul, Principal Investigator on glaciology in the Indian Department of Science and Technology, "the ecology, the environment, and the health of the glacier can be under severe threat in case the Baltal route to the holy Amarnath cave was frequented by thousands of pilgrims.
" Professor Kaul said heavy pilgrim traffic besides mountain expeditions resulted in depletion of glacier and environmental degradation.
He explained that "this depletion and degradation are the result of human breath, refuse and land erosion.
" When pilgrims can cause so much damage to the glaciers, imagine what the continual presence of troops from both countries must do to the ice and snow given their high-energy requirement.
Unlike Professor Kaul, Rajendra Pachauri, director-general of the Energy and Resources Institute, is quoted as saying: "A number of scientists say Siachen should be made a protected area, a heritage site of sorts, and that there should be no army presence on either side.
For purely ecological reasons, this might be a good idea.
But I don't see why there would be melting as a result of military presence and activity.
"
As with Gangotri, so with Siachen the increasing melting can be largely attributed to human activities in these areas.
In Siachen, which provides water to the Nubra river, a tributary of the Indus, the ecosystem has been hugely disturbed by the presence of nearly 15,000 troops on its two sides, consuming and defecating, soiling the area and littering it with the remains of war.
Much of this debris will flow into the Indus as the glacier melts.
Unfortunately, climate "experts" in Pakistan seem to lack knowledge of the importance of glaciers for our ecosystem.
In 2001, some of them associated with the Global Climate Change Impact Studies Centre in Islamabad suggested that glaciers be melted artificially (by lasers or darkening) to alleviate the drought in the plains!
This Centre was set up by old hands of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission.
It took one of their own colleagues, Khalid Rashid, to debunk in a conference paper their suggestions, which he labelled science fiction.
At Nairobi, governments are debating the future of the Kyoto Protocol and action to prevent the most serious impacts of climate change.
So far, they appear to have ignored pleas to address one of the greatest single sources of carbon emissions : the destruction of South-east Asia's peatlands and forests.
The annual emissions from annual peat and forest fires are about five times as great as the total annual emission cuts which the Kyoto Protocol aims to make by 2012, from 1990 levels.
Indonesia alone holds 60% of all tropical peat, containing some 50 billion tonnes of carbon.
This is equivalent to 7-8 years of global fossil fuel emissions.
Timber and oil palm plantations are draining the peatlands and also pushing local communities and small-holders into peat areas and rainforests.
Once this peat is drained, all this carbon will eventually be released into the atmosphere, unless the peat is subsequently re-flooded and restored.
Annual fires, many of them set deliberately by plantation owners, speed up the process.
This year's fire season has been one of the worst on record.
Wetlands International warned earlier this week that the boom in biofuels is speeding up the destruction, and further that one tonne of palm oil grown on peat is linked to the release of around 20 tonnes of carbon dioxide released from that peat.
Due to its low cost, palm oil is set to become the prime feedstock for biodiesel.
Biofuelwatch member Andrew Boswell says from Nairobi: â€œOver 6600 people from 75 countries have emailed governments to call for real action to address the causes of the annual peat and forest fires.
So far, there are no signs that delegates have listened.
UNFCCC exists to prevent dangerous climate change and to stabilise levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
This will be even harder to achieve unless tropical peatlands are protected and restored.

Since 1895, the media has alternated between global cooling and warming scares during four separate and sometimes overlapping time periods.
From 1895 until the 1930's the media peddled a coming ice age.
From the late 1920's until the 1960's they warned of global warming.
From the 1950's until the 1970's they warned us again of a coming ice age.
This makes modern global warming the fourth estate's fourth attempt to promote opposing climate change fears during the last 100 years.
Recently, advocates of alarmism have grown increasingly desperate to try to convince the public that global warming is the greatest moral issue of our generation.
Last year, the vice president of London's Royal Society sent a chilling letter to the media encouraging them to stifle the voices of scientists skeptical of climate alarmism.
During the past year, the American people have been served up an unprecedented parade of environmental alarmism by the media and entertainment industry, which link every possible weather event to global warming.
The year 2006 saw many major organs of the media dismiss any pretense of balance and objectivity on climate change coverage and instead crossed squarely into global warming advocacy.
The French government has come up with an intriguing and long overdue policy proposal of taxing countries' goods whose government has not ratified Kyoto [ more ] - namely Annex I countries Australia and the United States.
This presumably would compensate for their free rider economic behavior.
Australia has signaled they are moving closer to ratifying Kyoto in practice if not in name [ more ].
Meanwhile the Swiss are pushing the golden bullet of climate change policy - a broad based international tax on carbon emissions .
They propose that revenue be used for measures mitigating the effects of global warming.
This is very similar to Ecological Internet's own Lincoln Plan which further proposes tax increases are offset by tax reductions on employment.
UK is to tax gas guzzling SUVs .
And there is growing concensus in Nairobi that a Kyoto successor must come soone and include mandatory emission caps for all nations [ more | more2 ] while being more flexible and taking into account historical emissions levels and allowing developing nations some allowance to reduce poverty.
Clearly China is feeling the pressure to justify their policy as Chinese emissions are soaring .
I agree that sanctions and control efforts need to be implemented to help reduce emissions.
However, I also believe that we cannot slow down the rate of emissions fast enough to get us to a balancing point.
We must look at ways to pull carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere if we are to keep levels below the 400ppm threshold.
One suggestion is to develop huge oceanic algae farms, then to harvest those farms and transport the processed algae sludge (water extracted) to a polar region for freezing.
This would lock the CO2 into sheets of ice (providing there is any ice left).
Some would suggest using the algae for fuel, but this only releases the CO2 back into the atmosphere making it a CO2 neutral initiative.
Locking the algae into sheets of ice would remove the CO2 from the atmosphere.
However, there could be a dual initiative.
Perhaps whomever came up with the algae freezing plan missed the class on photosynthesis.
For all you folks out there who missed this one, plants (including algae) take in CO2, yes, and then they produce carbohydrates (food) and release oxygen (we breathe that) Feezing the algae would eliminate the CO2 removers and deplete the oxygen levels.
Brilliant!!! Great plan!!
!Oh yes, the Holocence which we are in is called an interglacial period.
That is a time when glaciers melt.
What are we missing here.
18,000 years ago a warming period began.
Chances are the ice where you currently live was a mile thick.
Makes the current warming period not sound so bad?
The result of humanity's burgeoning populations and emissions of industrial pollutants can best be seen at the poles.
This year's Antarctic ozone hole is the biggest ever [ more ].
While expected to eventually recover by itself, the discovery and policy formulation to address the ozone hole illustrate humanity's lack of awareness of planetary ecological functions and their impacts thereon, as well as the ability of humanity to unite to address global ecological issues.
In the Arctic polar region, Greenland's melting ice is accelerating beyond even the grimmest predictions of possiblities due to global heating.
Meanwhile Canada - itself falling partially within the Arctic - is abandoning Kyoto emission reduction targets .
We are witnessing the disintegration of the global ecological system upon which humanity is utterly dependent, and our leaders are failing us.
An unprecedented global ecological apocalypse of disease and refugees [ more ] calls for dramatic responses - immediately dramatically reducing emissions, ending old-growth logging and ensuring access to water as a human right.
Buckle your seatbelt, humanity is in for the ride of its life.
OK, green house gasses.... Implies that they make the earth warmer right?
And, having had a greenhouse I noticed that plants grow a lot faster in a warm greenhouse.
Don't plants process the CO2 and lock away the carbon?
So, the warmer the earth is the more the plants grow, the more CO2 gets removed from the atmosphere, the cooler the planet gets.
Am I missing something here?
After a period of increased growth, however, research shows that the ability of plants to benefit from increasing CO2 diminishes and eventually disappears.
We also know (from sophisticated computers models whose predictions and data support what we are seeing in the natural world around us as it warms) that increased temperatures will lead to extremes of temperature and irregular rainfall patterns that will harm, and may eventually eliminate, many plant species.
In addition, we are producing so much carbon emissions that no amount of increased plant growth could absorb most of the additional carbon loading our species is currently responsible for, from fossil fuel combustion, methane production, or event from deforestation.
Earth's plant life will not be able to â€œstoreâ€ excess carbon from rising atmospheric carbon dioxide levels as well as scientists once thought because plants likely cannot get enough nutrients, such as nitrogen, when there are higher levels of carbon dioxide, according to scientists publishing in this week's issue of the journal Nature.
That, in turn, is likely to dampen the ability of plants to offset increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide.
â€œWe found that atmospheric carbon dioxide levels may rise even faster than anticipated, because ecosystems likely will not store as much carbon as had been predicted,â€ said Peter Reich of the University of Minnesota, lead author of the study, which was conducted at the National Science Foundation (NSF)'s Cedar Creek Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site in Minnesota.
â€œAs a result, soils will be unable to sustain plant growth over time [as atmospheric carbon dioxide continues to increase],â€ said plant ecologist David Ellsworth of the University of Michigan..... (continued)
The point is that Earth's vegetation and oceans cannot be expected to just suck up all of our excess carbon dioxide emissions indefinitely.
It seems to me that a lot of people are counting on things to work out that way.....
Global warming is my right.
I just don't think you all have any right to take it away from me.
There have been warmer periods in recorded history.
1300's I think.
And the northern hemisphere was more productive for farming then.
Did you hear the joke about how many Australians it takes to recognize climate change induced environmental ruin in the form of deadly drought and wildfires?
Apparently more than the lackluster government can muster, as Australia refuses to implement rigorous climate change policies as it is being wracked by the " worst drought in a century [ more | more2 ] with rampant fires devastating agricultural areas, rivers drying up, crops failing, and farmers forced to sell off their livestock.
" Australia is an incredibly ecologically fragile continent, and Australians have been whooping it up for decades, unsustainably crapping on the atmosphere, rivers and land.
It is absolutely crucial that Australia and the United States cease their obstruction of international climate change policy and ratify the Kyoto protocol (expect more activism in this regard here soon).
Kyoto [search] is clearly inadequate to achieve the magnitude of emissions cuts necesary to save the Earth and human existence.
But it does provide mechanisms that can and must be strengthened.
In which we learn that:- free access and unrestricted demand (By-product of fossil fuel released energy)for a finite resource(Atmosphere providing life giving services such as a stable climate courtesy of the Gaia effect:being used as pollution sink)ultimately dooms the resource(Stable climate and other life giving services)through over exploitation.
On a personal level whether I drive my car or not makes no difference:The other hundreds of millions of drivers will not be affected by my decision either way:I'm free to pollute the commons without any responsibility :Like a 1 billion motoring firing squad my little contribution could never be blamed for climate chaos.
As George Monbiot has said,to paraphrase,If people have a choice between saving the atmosphere or having a new dinner ware set!
The atmosphere is going to come second every time!
Australia's problem has always been apathy - getting our citizens up and into action is a difficult thing to achieve.
As an activist, I find it disheartening and frustrating.
But I do know that increasingly the mass media is reporting the truth about global climate change and the disastrous affects it will bring to everyone if we don't act now, and people *are* waking up and demanding action from our elected (or not elected, depending on who you voted for) officials.
The drought, which is a whopper, is due due to no bloody rain for like a few years, look to city yobbos and Co 2 emissions, thanks, and a farmer a day is committing suicide..So working together we might save this planet for our children...
Does anyone here have an idea to what degree the thinning of stratospheric ozone over the southern hemisphere has been impacting the drought situation in Australia?
It seems to me that this situation has been developing for a few years now.
"As George Monbiot has said,to paraphrase,If people have a choice between saving the atmosphere or having a new dinner ware set!
The atmosphere is going to come second every time!

As Washington was hammered by the sort of extreme weather expected to increase due to climate change, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a case that will determine whether under current law the Bush administration must regulate carbon dioxide ( more | more2 | more3 ).
The Bush administration has been sued by twelve states for failing to properly implement the Clean Air Act in regard to automobile emissions.
The case is the most important environmental issue in years to be heard by the high court.
Essentially what is at stake is "the survival of the Earth as we know it.
" While certainly climate science (search) and the Bush obstructiveness cry out for an affirmative decision, it will be good news either way to know whether the E.P.A.
must regulate carbon dioxide (search) .
If they must, they can start immediately, if not, the legislature has no excuse for not swiftly getting such a law in place.
The interests of humanity and all species are so threatened that frankly "legislating from the bench" that carbon regulation is a national imperative would be welcome.
Witnessing the impact of global warming in your life?
ABC News wants to hear from you.
We're currently producing a report on the increasing changes in our physical environment, and are looking for interesting examples of people coping with the differences in their daily lives.
Has your life been directly affected by global warming?
We need to be careful of climate alarmism.
Not that global warming is NOT A problem, but the bottom line is that it is a speculative problem and it is important to note that the statement "global warming will destroy earth as we know it" is NOT FACT, but SPECULATION.
Here is an important article on the topic from Richard S. Lindzen, Professor of Atmospheric Science at MIT:
According to Al Gore's new film "An Inconvenient Truth," we're in for "a planetary emergency": melting ice sheets, huge increases in sea levels, more and stronger hurricanes, and invasions of tropical disease, among other cataclysms--unless we change the way we live now.
Bill Clinton has become the latest evangelist for Mr. Gore's gospel, proclaiming that current weather events show that he and Mr. Gore were right about global warming, and we are all suffering the consequences of President Bush's obtuseness on the matter.
And why not?
Mr. Gore assures us that "the debate in the scientific community is over.
"
The media rarely help, of course.
When Newsweek featured global warming in a 1988 issue, it was claimed that all scientists agreed.
Periodically thereafter it was revealed that although there had been lingering doubts beforehand, now all scientists did indeed agree.
Even Mr. Gore qualified his statement on ABC only a few minutes after he made it, clarifying things in an important way.
When Mr. Stephanopoulos confronted Mr. Gore with the fact that the best estimates of rising sea levels are far less dire than he suggests in his movie, Mr. Gore defended his claims by noting that scientists "don't have any models that give them a high level of confidence" one way or the other and went on to claim--in his defense--that scientists "don't know.
. .
. They just don't know.
"
So, presumably, those scientists do not belong to the "consensus.
" Yet their research is forced, whether the evidence supports it or not, into Mr. Gore's preferred global-warming template--namely, shrill alarmism.
To believe it requires that one ignore the truly inconvenient facts.
To take the issue of rising sea levels, these include: that the Arctic was as warm or warmer in 1940; that icebergs have been known since time immemorial; that the evidence so far suggests that the Greenland ice sheet is actually growing on average.
A likely result of all this is increased pressure pushing ice off the coastal perimeter of that country, which is depicted so ominously in Mr. Gore's movie.
In the absence of factual context, these images are perhaps dire or alarming.
The other elements of the global-warming scare scenario are predicated on similar oversights.
Malaria, claimed as a byproduct of warming, was once common in Michigan and Siberia and remains common in Siberia--mosquitoes don't require tropical warmth.
Hurricanes, too, vary on multidecadal time scales; sea-surface temperature is likely to be an important factor.
This temperature, itself, varies on multidecadal time scales.
However, questions concerning the origin of the relevant sea-surface temperatures and the nature of trends in hurricane intensity are being hotly argued within the profession.
Even among those arguing, there is general agreement that we can't attribute any particular hurricane to global warming.
To be sure, there is one exception, Greg Holland of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., who argues that it must be global warming because he can't think of anything else.
While arguments like these, based on lassitude, are becoming rather common in climate assessments, such claims, given the primitive state of weather and climate science, are hardly compelling.
A general characteristic of Mr. Gore's approach is to assiduously ignore the fact that the earth and its climate are dynamic; they are always changing even without any external forcing.
To treat all change as something to fear is bad enough; to do so in order to exploit that fear is much worse.
Regardless, these items are clearly not issues over which debate is ended--at least not in terms of the actual science.
A clearer claim as to what debate has ended is provided by the environmental journalist Gregg Easterbrook.
He concludes that the scientific community now agrees that significant warming is occurring, and that there is clear evidence of human influences on the climate system.
This is still a most peculiar claim.
At some level, it has never been widely contested.
Most of the climate community has agreed since 1988 that global mean temperatures have increased on the order of one degree Fahrenheit over the past century, having risen significantly from about 1919 to 1940, decreased between 1940 and the early '70s, increased again until the '90s, and remaining essentially flat since 1998.
There is also little disagreement that levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere have risen from about 280 parts per million by volume in the 19th century to about 387 ppmv today.
Finally, there has been no question whatever that carbon dioxide is an infrared absorber (i.e., a greenhouse gas--albeit a minor one), and its increase should theoretically contribute to warming.
Indeed, if all else were kept equal, the increase in carbon dioxide should have led to somewhat more warming than has been observed, assuming that the small observed increase was in fact due to increasing carbon dioxide rather than a natural fluctuation in the climate system.
Although no cause for alarm rests on this issue, there has been an intense effort to claim that the theoretically expected contribution from additional carbon dioxide has actually been detected.
Given that we do not understand the natural internal variability of climate change, this task is currently impossible.
Nevertheless there has been a persistent effort to suggest otherwise, and with surprising impact.
Thus, although the conflicted state of the affair was accurately presented in the 1996 text of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the infamous "summary for policy makers" reported ambiguously that "The balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate.
" This sufficed as the smoking gun for Kyoto.
The next IPCC report again described the problems surrounding what has become known as the attribution issue: that is, to explain what mechanisms are responsible for observed changes in climate.
Some deployed the lassitude argument--e.g., we can't think of an alternative--to support human attribution.
But the "summary for policy makers" claimed in a manner largely unrelated to the actual text of the report that "In the light of new evidence and taking into account the remaining uncertainties, most of the observed warming over the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations.
"
In a similar vein, the National Academy of Sciences issued a brief (15-page) report responding to questions from the White House.
It again enumerated the difficulties with attribution, but again the report was preceded by a front end that ambiguously claimed that "The changes observed over the last several decades are likely mostly due to human activities, but we cannot rule out that some significant part of these changes is also a reflection of natural variability.
" This was sufficient for CNN's Michelle Mitchell to presciently declare that the report represented a "unanimous decision that global warming is real, is getting worse and is due to man.
There is no wiggle room.
" Well, no.
More recently, a study in the journal Science by the social scientist Nancy Oreskes claimed that a search of the ISI Web of Knowledge Database for the years 1993 to 2003 under the key words "global climate change" produced 928 articles, all of whose abstracts supported what she referred to as the consensus view.
A British social scientist, Benny Peiser, checked her procedure and found that only 913 of the 928 articles had abstracts at all, and that only 13 of the remaining 913 explicitly endorsed the so-called consensus view.
Several actually opposed it.
Even more recently, the Climate Change Science Program, the Bush administration's coordinating agency for global-warming research, declared it had found "clear evidence of human influences on the climate system.
" This, for Mr. Easterbrook, meant: "Case closed.
" What exactly was this evidence?
The models imply that greenhouse warming should impact atmospheric temperatures more than surface temperatures, and yet satellite data showed no warming in the atmosphere since 1979.
The report showed that selective corrections to the atmospheric data could lead to some warming, thus reducing the conflict between observations and models descriptions of what greenhouse warming should look like.
That, to me, means the case is still very much open.
First, nonscientists generally do not want to bother with understanding the science.
Claims of consensus relieve policy types, environmental advocates and politicians of any need to do so.
Such claims also serve to intimidate the public and even scientists--especially those outside the area of climate dynamics.
Secondly, given that the question of human attribution largely cannot be resolved, its use in promoting visions of disaster constitutes nothing so much as a bait-and-switch scam.
That is an inauspicious beginning to what Mr. Gore claims is not a political issue but a "moral" crusade.
Global Warming and Cooling, Climate Change Versus Weather
Much ado has been made [ ark | more \ ark ] regarding a study last week in Nature which found that global warming may slow or even temporarily cool over the coming decade.
This was seized upon by all sorts of climate skeptics [search] and charlatans to suggest climate change is not so important after all.
I have three brief responses.
Firstly, the rise in average global temperature is only one way to characterize change in atmospheric patterns and processes.
It is becoming apparent that broader extremes around temperature averages -- as demonstrated by unusual weather events, including quite possibly the cyclone in Myanmar [ ark ] -- may be the greater harm.
This is why "climate change" has long been recognized as a better term than "global warming" to communicate these dynamics.
Secondly, as RealClimate points out in their post " Global Cooling - Wanna Bet?
" -- this study and other recent coverage of a lack of warming in recent years are flawed because they compare long term climate change to short term weather variability [search] .
There have been lulls, peaks and troughs in the plainly evident past human-caused global warming and there will be as we go forward.
As various oscillations break down and the climate becomes more chaotic, it is probable various feedbacks will temporarily lead to cooling.
And lastly, let us keep in mind that climate change is but one symptom of a larger systematic break down in the biosphere.
Water scarcity, soil depletion, lifeless oceans, biodiversity extinction, bioaccumulating toxics and many other ecological crises illustrate humanity's numbers and consumption patterns overwhelming global ecosystems which make life possible.
The science is clear and settled, climate is inexorably warming and becoming more unpredictable, exacerbating these other ecological crises and threatening to dramatically change what it means to live on the planet Earth.

How many people in the U.S. midwest alone have lost their lives to tornadoes since February 2008?
My theory about the recent dip in global temperatures, for what it's worth, is simply this.
If you measured the temperature of your ice cooled PIMs on a hot summers day, you would find that it stays at just above zero deg C right up until all the ice goes.
All the heat energy entering the glass from the warm surrounding air is focused on melting the ice.
Same is happening to Earth - judging from the rate of ice melt at the poles - there's a hell of a lot of energy being absorbed.
What will happen when the sea ice goes?
80 months to go and I hate my PIMs warm.
Get building that ark!
address it as ''climate disturbance'' instead of ''climate chance'' course that's what it is.
Ecological Internet and this blog are dedicated to highlighting the severity of global ecological crises [search] , including threatened abrupt climate change [search] , while promoting rigorous and sufficient biocentric responses.
Now more main-stream think tanks and environmentalists are catching up with us.
if more and more people would be concerned on our environment, destruction of this earth would at least slow down.
Let us take action now by at least doing this 50 tips on global warming
Personally, I believe that James Lovelock is quite right.
The tipping point is past.
There is already far too much carbon and most likely methane now as well, in the atmosphere.
The human population explosion of the past few hundred years is about to come literally crashing down.
It seems, Nature does not desire any one species to dominate a planet so completely.
There is strength in having a variety of life and no one species ought to so dominate a planet's ecosystem as humans have.
The report 'Some say climate report wasn't pessimistic enough', (Page 1, Nov 19th) while pointing out the dire consequences of Global Warming has not addressed the scientific fact that there is a massive difference between biotic carbon (carbon in the living world) and fossil carbon (carbon that is not a part of the living world).
Allowing carbon from fossil sources to gain the same value as biotic carbon by cycling it through a tree is nothing short of 'Carbon Laundering' very much the same as money laundering.
Residence times for biotic carbon is measured in hundreds of thousands of years, while fossil carbon is measured in times of tens of millions years.
To make matters worse the perverse system adopted today does not recognize time as a value variable.
The concept of 'incremented carbon' does not value the time that carbon is sequestered for, only the carbon sequestered through human interventions is.
Thus it is profitable to cut down an old growth forest and replace it with a quick growing plantation.
Not only was the IPCC report not dire enough it has ignored fundamental scientific facts.

Proved awareness to ecology and transmission is necessary to understand the spread of avian flu.
For this it is insufficient exclusive to test samples from wild birds, poultry and humans for avian flu viruses.
Samples from the known abiotic vehicles also have to be analysed.
There are plain links between the cold, rainy seasons as well as floods and the spread of avian flu.
That is just why abiotic vehicles have to be analysed.
The direct biotic transmission from birds, poultry or humans to humans can not depend on the cold, rainy seasons or floods.
Water is a very efficient abiotic vehicle for the spread of viruses - in particular of fecal as well as by mouth, nose and eyes excreted viruses.
Infected birds and poultry can everywhere contaminate the drinking water.
All humans have very intensive contact to drinking water.
To prove viruses in water is difficult because of dilution.
If you find no viruses you can not be sure that there are not any.
On the other hand in water viruses remain viable for a long time.
Water has to be tested for influenza viruses by cell culture and in particular by the more sensitive molecular biology method PCR.
There is a widespread link between avian flu and water, e.g.
in Egypt to the Nile delta or Indonesia to residential districts of less prosperous humans with backyard flocks and without central water supply as in Vietnam: http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol12no12/06-0829.htm.
See also the WHO web side: http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/emerging/h5n1background.pdf .
Avian flu infections may increase in consequence to increase of virus circulation.
In hot climates/the tropics flood-related influenza is typical after extreme weather and floods.
Virulence of influenza viruses depends on temperature and time.
Special in cases of local water supplies with “young” and fresh H5N1 contaminated water from low local wells, cisterns, tanks, rain barrels, ponds, rivers or rice paddies this pathway can explain small clusters in households.
At 24°C e.g.
in the tropics the virulence of influenza viruses in water amount to 2 days.
In temperate climates for “older” water from central water supplies cold water is decisive to virulence of viruses.
At 7°C the virulence of influenza viruses in water amount to 14 days.
Human to human and contact transmission of influenza occur - but are overvalued immense.
In the course of influenza epidemics in Germany, recognized clusters are rare, accounting for just 9 percent of cases e.g.
in the 2005 season.
In temperate climates the lethal H5N1 virus will be transferred to humans via cold drinking water, as with the birds in February and March 2006, strong seasonal at the time when drinking water has its temperature minimum.
The performance to eliminate viruses from the drinking water processing plants regularly does not meet the requirements of the WHO and the USA/USEPA.
Conventional disinfection procedures are poor, because microorganisms in the water are not in suspension, but embedded in particles.
Even ground water used for drinking water is not free from viruses.

] and people – and not chickens – have emerged as the most significant factors in the spread of avian influenza in Thailand and Viet Nam, according to a study carried out by a group of experts from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and associated research centres.
I am trying to focus attention on the pressing need for human beings to protect and preserve the finite resources of Earth and its frangible ecosystems.
If we fail to achieve this goal, then an unimaginably bleak future could await our children.
In all the seriousness of what could be somehow true, I mean the children of my generation.
If 6+ billion human beings live on Earth now and 9+ billion are expected to populate our small planet by 2050, then the human species simply cannot keep engaging in certain unbridled activities that we can see overspreading the Earth because the Earth has limited resources upon which all forms of life and human constructions like national economies utterly depend for existence.
Without adequate resources and ecosystem system services of Earth, life as we know it and human institutions could collapse, I suppose.
Now, some portion of the world’s human population conspicuously over-consumes the resources of our planetary home.
Other people, working in huge multinational conglomerations, are operating businesses in a way that recklessly scours the oceans' floor, decapitates mountains, turns biomass into human mass and, in these and many other ways, end up dissipating natural resources at such an alarming rate that the Earth has insufficient time to restore the resources for human benefit.
Still other people in the family of humanity are overpopulating the planet.
The leviathan-like scale and rapid growth of global human consumption, production and propagation activities are putting the Earth, life as we know it, and the human community in grave, clear and present danger.
Elder human beings of the overdeveloped world, of whom I am one, are among the people in our planetary home who are ravenously over-consuming Earth's resources.
We could choose to consume less.
People in the developing could choose to limit overproduction of unnecessary things, to stop ravaging the planet, and to contain industrial pollution.
People in the underdeveloped world could limit their number of offspring.
Perhaps these are some ways the family of humanity begins to respond ably to the human-induced global challenges that loom so ominously before humanity in our time.
The metasystem approach - redundancy of vital systems - is of course the answer.
This is what we see in practice when forests collapse, for example.
However, the global marketplace itself does not appear to permit for redundancy by definition, inasmuch as we have one globe.
Yet, it seems that this global system IS intrinsically redundant, permitting efficient access to alternative sources of essential commodities, etc, but what this thinking overlooks is that all resources are accessed and protected locally, so that the greater our reliance on the global system, the greater our consequent loss of ability to protect resources.
Indeed, this the root problem today.
The solution is a marketplace metasystem.

I read the 'climate apocalyptic' info yu sent, seems so vague old retro repeating their failure to know whats really needed, liveable, healthy, natural, sustainable, renewable & efficient we need/are doing here now at home organically.
Let's not create a self-fulfilling prophecy by talking about the end of civlization...Who knows what humans will do this planet in the future.
The only hope I see is that the more industrialized a country becomes, the more able it is to implement environmental checks.
Hopefully earth can survive pollution for another 100yrs--then we'll all run on solar cells, etc.
If not, then we'll have to live in a giant Homemade Aviary like some bird...
Death of coral reefs from climate change is not theory or conjecture of what might happen if we continue relentlessly emitting greenhouse gases.
This is but the most recent evidence that climate change continues to unravel the biological foundation of existence, acting in conjunction with and magnifying forces such as habitat destruction, water diminishment and ocean decline.
This biological homogenization [search] is happening now, in front of our eyes, and the processes and ramifications are known and understood by ecological science.
Let us be clear: ecosystems which provide our sustenance are dying because of what we do.
What level of destruction will it take to awaken the global consciousness?
I have read some of the many news reports on the ocean acidification and reef crisis that are presently extant.
I beg to differ with the position that reducing our global carbon footprint will help save our ocean bathing beauties, the reefs.
It's not that I don't fully support reducing our carbon footprint, I am rather more concerned about the role of the present deadly dose of anthropogenic CO2 already in the air on its way to our surface ocean waters.
Those hundreds of billions of tonnes of anthropogenic CO2, the bulk of which we've prescribed and put en route in the past 75 years, is slowly dissolving into the surface ocean.
By most accounts CO2 in the atmosphere takes on the order of 200 years to equilibrate with the surface ocean.
Hence the pH drop we've been recording is just the proverbial tip of the dry-iceberg.
As the surface ocean absorbs the rest of this deadly dose, regardless of whether we emit more which we surely are doing, the acidification process already destined to occur is more than sufficient to change ocean ecology in far wider and disastrous fashion than merely scalding the bathing beauties at the shore.
In fact the devastating effects CO2 has on the ocean is not proceeding only via H2O+CO2=H2CO3 (carbonic acid), there is a secondary reaction wherein CO2 is enhancing the greeness of the planets dry lands.
There is is a major benefit our high and rising CO2 delivers to droughty grasses who are losing less water via evapotranspiration, remaining green and growing bushier each spring, and as such are superior ground cover thus reducing topsoil loss in the wind.
Tragically that dust in the wind is the major source of vital mineral micronutrients for the open ocean.
Prophetically it seems, all we really are is dust in the wind.
So as our reef beauties cry out and dissolve like Dorothy's wicked witch in our acidifying oceans, the acidification will certainly continue for at least another century unabated even if we never emit another molecule of fossil CO2 into the air.
At the same time as the oceans suffer this chemical shock treatment, like those we give our swimming pools, they will continue as well to lose their photosynthetic capacity to counter this onslaught.
The loss of net primary productivity, NPP, is reportedly 17% in the North Atlantic, 26% in the North Pacific, and 50% in the sub-tropical tropical oceans.
We can find the fundamental proof of the depth of this problem by considering it from the point of view of basic chemical thermodynamics.
Indeed we have expended a hundred terrawatts or so burning fossil carbon to put that deadly dose of CO2 into our atmosphere and ocean.
No trivial energy savings will serve to counter its certain first principals chemical effects.
We can still trust in what the Second Law of Thermodynamics teaches us in that one must balance equations energetically.
If we are to address a problem created by terrawatts of energy we must devote terrawatts of energy.
In this case those curative terrawatts better be emission free or we are lost.
The Bush administration has been successfully obstructing climate change [search] science and policy for so long, it probably comes as somewhat of a surprise when they are caught and held to account.
The latest, Vice President Dick Cheney’s office removed statements on health risks posed by global warming [ ark | more / ark | search ] from a draft of a health official’s Senate testimony last year.
What sort of man in what sort of government thinks themselves above the law, censoring science at the expense of public health and the biosphere?
It is critical these instances are investigated, particularly the cover-up, and if appropriate, criminal charges filed.
The world is at a crisis point in terms of climate.
Pointing fingers at who censored whom is meaningless...and is as small and mean spirited as Cheney's attempt to suppress the facts.
Re: R. Gate's comment - It is not meaningless to expose climate censorship when it is still happening and hampering adequate policy responses, and criminal acts are likely to have occurred.
but without James Hansen we'd be nowhere.
Recall his 1988 testimony on the threat of climate change?
I sure do - I was in my first year of law school studying environmental law.
It had a HUGE impact on me.
It actually IS very relevant when the Bush Administration spends enormous amounts of time and energy and staff trying to squelch the results of climate research by good folks with the best intentions.
And that is precisely what they have done for years.
Intelligent people know the truth of the urgency.
Vote the dishonest out of office and DEMAND action on climate issues from all leaders...and rather than fiddling while Rome is burning, put the fiddle down and toss the dishonest dinosaurs like Cheney out on their fat white hineys!
Not to mention ignorance.
There are numerous govts today that are not dictatorships, and some (such as several of the Scandinavian countries, as well as several others in the EU) that are actually trying to combat global warming seriously.
What will stop the coal trains from running?
What will stop the factories from pumping out plastic junk in China?

Sound impossible perhaps, but just a few years ago so did the complete melting of the north polar ice cap in our lifetimes.
If serious about maintaining both a habitable Earth and an operable atmosphere, while maintaining a market based economic system, there is no choice but to urgently embrace a similar global carbon tax [search] immediately.
Such a tax as proposed in Ecological Internet's Lincoln Plan can and must be offset with reductions in other taxes [ ark ], and can be tightened as required to bring about necessary reductions in energy use.
Capitalism's consistent over-use of natural capital can only be addressed if all associated costs -- such as overwhelming the atmosphere's capacity to absorbe waste -- are reflected in prices.
Capitalism will fall due to ecological collapse and resultant social upheaval unless major efforts are made to globally assess a price on carbon, and assess this price in taxes, in all haste.
The incredible ecosystem disruptions ahead must be met with radical changes to human lifestyles...and these changes can be done voluntarily, or mother nature will force her inevitable and eternal will upon us.
But climate is a 33 year average of weather, so even if you are proven correct (most unlikely), it really means nothing about climate.
"All four major global temperature tracking outlets (Hadley, NASA's GISS, UAH, RSS) have released updated data.
All show that over the past year, global temperatures have dropped precipitously"
This after a decade (1998 to 2008) of unremarkable change.
Arctic ice packs have recovered in area and mass, antarctic continues to set maximum records in area and mass.
La Nina, as I understand it, transfers heat.
Should there not be a corresponding warm area?
if not where did the heat go?
And If the lack of solar energy has caused such a recent dramatic drop in temperature what does that say for the significance of CO2?
If you have read anything at all about climate (vs. weather, which is a short-term phenomenon) you would realize that a warming world does not mean we will never have cold weather, or that it will suddenly stop snowing worldwide and heat up across the globe.
Far from it - in any upward trend line in a natural phenomenon, we would expect to see variation above and below the line - and the temperature trend over the last three decades is clearly up overall.
You cannot argue with that one without ignoring the data.
As for the Arctic ice pack, we're at the tail end of winter in the Northern Hemisphere - remember?
I think a more accurate objection to GCMs (global climate models) would be better made in 2009 - which is when the global climate models predict temperatures will increase significantly again.
Last summers minimum Arctic ice pack can not be touted as a sure example of global warming ( Gore Et al, last fall, loudly and with fervent conviction) then discounted after this seasons full recovery as merely weather without some astonished amusement from others.
Although I agree, its weather and all the weird unknown things that entails.
Using Davids 33 year requirement (above), the recent 23 years (1975 to 1998) of warming falls short of a climate trend.
Remember? temperature fell from the mid 1930's until 1975 before climbing back to the high of 1998, dropped slightly or remained stable until Jan 2007 then dropping dramatically 0.65 to 0.75 degrees C over the past year, all while CO2 levels continued its steady increase.
Yes this is near the end of Arctic winter but also near the end of summer at the south pole which continues setting records for maximum amounts of ice coverage.
If oceans have continued to warm and have an impact on global temperatures why have they not tempered this past years global cooling?
Does this mean the lack of sun is responsible for all of the recent cooling?
Why attach much credence to CO2 centric climate model forcasts for 2009 and beyond if solar influence, or something, is apparently such an abrupt and overriding factor.
I rely on RealClimate.org, which is composed of climate scientists, not ideologues.
I would be curious where you are getting data to show that global temps have been stable since the late 1990s.
The data on ocean temperatures is irrefutable - as is the data on ocean acidification - are you familiar with both?
At the current rate of acidification from CO2 emissions, the oceans will be exceptionally inhospitable to marine life later this century.
AS IN, no more oysters, clams, mussels, or any sea creatures with shells composed of calcium carbonate.
Recall your basic chemistry........
I will take my cues from the IPCC, 1200 climate scientists from every nation on the planet who review all the data on global warming trends twice every decade.
Their November 2007 summary report (available online) concluded that we have at most a decade to reverse the growth in carbon emissions to avoid creating a "different planet" in the decades to come (quote from James Hansen of NASA).
I do not read any one source for information and I despise being led into an article to find a biased agenda or only half the story....good luck with that on global warming eh.
Any site that will honestly assemble then link to sound base information without mangling it is good.
Any one person in a position to offer strict professional knowledge in an area related to climate change is likewise of value.
With that in mind.
If you don't believe that computer models have legitimacy as predictors you better not get on a plane or any other piece of complex gear.
I have news for you - computer models are actually in widespread use in our technological society!
And the GCM's have been doing a pretty accurate job when compared with actual observations of climate trends.
The idea that we will never have cold weather in a warming world shows again that you are confusing weather with climate.
As I've already said it's the trend that matters, and the trend is pretty clear.
But then again, if you don't believe that computers can be used to model complex phenomena, and think that 1,200 climate scientists are engaged in a massive fraud why are you on this site?
(1) Why is there a drought in central Chile this summer?
Why is there severe flooding in several countries in southeast Africa?
(2) The variation in solar irradiance over the sunpot cycle is very moodest.
In any case, think of climate as weather averaged globally and over three such cycles, 33 years.
"From this we see that the slight cooling the planet’s land areas experienced from about 1940 to 1975 was pretty much restricted to the northern hemisphere; during that time, the southern hemisphere shows some wiggles but no sustained cooling.
This agrees with the explanation that mid-century cooling was due to the increase of atmospheric aerosols from industrial activity.
Man-made aerosols don’t stay in the atmosphere very long, so their climate impact is mainly regional (not “local,” but regional).
The vast majority of mid-century industrial activity took place in the northern hemisphere, so most of the cooling effect of industrial aerosol production is confided to the northern hemisphere.
"
remember - climate truly IS a complex phenomena.
That works both ways, of course!
I think direct observations can be of great value, however using them for a precise history is problematic.
A large percent of the recording stations fail to meet National Climatic Data Center guidelines.
There has been problems with RSS feeds as well.
(hows that for saying nothing)
Thanks for leaving the door wide open.
An old crone peers into a Crystal ball and makes predictions.
2007 was inaccurately predicted to be a very busy year for hurricanes.
(and wasn't) No models that I am aware of predicted the dramatic temperature drop in 2007.
No heavy commercial aircraft will leave the ground without an alternate airstrip and enough fuel to reach the place despite a clear weather prediction.
Such is the inconclusive nature of predictions and such is the limited "art" of current climate models.
(2) As I am sure you are aware the sun has cycled down at the same time earth cooled off, there would seem to be a lesson there somewhere.
Also, there is a growing knowledge and support of a 1500 year climate cycle.....I will chase down the link if you wish.
Gosh.
You ought to learn some climatology.
There is no 1500 year 'cycle' in climate, but there are processes which operate on millenial scales.
In any case, solar variability, at any scale, is a minor player in the internal variability of climate.
"Climate models only include the effects of the small variations in the direct solar radiation (infrared, visible and UV).
The effects of cosmic rays on clouds are not included in models and the models do a rather poor job of simulating clouds in the present climate.
Since cloud feedbacks are a large source of uncertainty, this is a reason for concern when viewing climate model predictions.
"
(2)the 1500 year climate cycle, again below.
The 1500 year Dansgaard-Oeschger climate cycle has been identified since 1985ish.
Where have you been?
Someone already referenced the fact that you don't need to rely on computer models to know that the planet's climate is changing.
Look around you.
Where I live, in the Pacific Northwest, it has warmed 3 degrees on average since 1950 (University of Washington data).
Spring definitely comes earlier here, on average, as it does in many places in the Northern Hemisphere.
And temperature increases have already led to noticeable shrinkage of all the glaciers in the Cascade Mountains.
This is beginning to affect water availability for irrigation and other uses, and is not subject to a heck of a lot of debate.
It's happening.
But (for the third time, perhaps that is the charm?
) it's silly to suggest that a warming world will never have cooler periods - just that the overall trend is up.
And that is in fact what we are seeing.
Claiming that a cooler year somehow demolishes all the other evidence accumulated over the last several decades is like claiming that a particularly powerful hurricane was due unequivocably to global warming.
Scientists generally don't make those kinds of claims - as one of your guys, Patrick Michaels of the U of Virginia, noted in the NY Times article.
I might take the climate sceptic/denial industry more seriously if they had some folks with current academic credentials (as in, recently published in peer-reviewed journals) on their side, esp scientists who are not "on the payroll" of the carbon polluter lobby.
But they don't - even Lindzen, their guru at MIT, no longer publishes much - he mostly lectures for the denial industry and enjoys watching himself on Fox and similar venues.
So where's the intellectual backup for all of this stuff?
It's among meteorologists, not climate scientists.
In other words, weather forecasters who are taught from day #1 that long term weather forecasting is not possible.
But we're talking here about long term climate trends, not weather forecasting.
There IS a difference, as others have noted........
(1) No change in cosmic ray flux in the past 50 years.
Therefore cannot be a cause of current global warming.
The external costs of CO2 emissions may well be around $10 or more per ton.
So the sensible thing would seem to be tax emissions and use proceeds to invest in infrastructure worldwide and other efforts to offset the damage from global warming.
Which is why gasoline is good for global warming, because it can "pay the bill": http://petersmagnusson.com/2008/03/05/gasoline-is-good-for-global-warming/
Why is there no outcry to stop the use of Ethanol?
The destruction of the Amazon and draining of our aquifers are a direct result.
The focus on CO emissions is a polictal lie.
The proven fact remains that CO is not the cause but mearly the result of global warming.
The real fear should be that a global ice age is about to begin!
2007 is .75 degrees cooler!
That is the biggest drop in 100 years!
I say we stop the disctruction of our planet and stop worring about the things that we can't control.. namely the temperature of the Earth.
Fact is... we are at the end of the global warming cycle and the Earth is about to enter a long cooling phase.
G8's Climate Failure, Promising to Talk Further in Bali
While trumpeting yet more rhetoric on climate change absent action goals and timetables as a victory, the G8 leaders have failed to reach agreement on immediate emission targets to keep global mean temperature rise below 2 degrees compared to pre-industrial levels.
The failed to gain concensus on a mandatory 50 percent reduction in global emissions.
The US and Russia remained isolated in their refusal to accept binding emission cuts ; as Europe and Japan embraced goals of cutting greenhouse gases by 50% by 2050.
The Bush administration has evaded mandatory emission cuts saying they will "seriously consider" setting reduction targets with the rest of the world at a later date.
About the only immediate good news of any substance to come out of the G8 climate change meetings is a pledge for talks on a Kyoto successor .
There appears at least rhetorically to be a renewed political mandate to start negotiating a second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol during climate meetings in Bali in December.
This is something that Ecological Internet's network campaigned for in recent weeks, as 2709 people sent 637,868 protest emails to UNFCCC government focal points.
I would very much love to be proven wrong, but Bush's recent pronouncements do not make him a friend of global climate.
When climate science indicates 80-90% cuts in carbon dioxide and other GHG are required by 2050 to avert abrupt climate disaster, it is terrible that Bush's reengagement in international climate policy making seems limited to floating proposals to delay and further obstruct active measures with goals and timetables.
World leaders are failing their citizens, countries and Earth by constantly dragging their feet on getting going with mandatory emission reduction targets.
RESPONSE: Peak oil and gas perhpas, but we are some time from peak coal and if all the coal that exists and is accessible is burned the atmosphere is toast.
It's a community to share actions against global warming.
Insists can 'protect' ancient forests & climate while actively promoting their first time 'certified' logging
Greenpeace International has confirmed astonishing allegations by Ecological Internet that they actively promote and support the logging of ancient forests, at great expense to the Earth's climate.
In their statement Greenpeace acknowledges they are "committed to protecting the world’s remaining ancient forests" yet support "the FSC as the only credible global certification system.
" What?
Has Greenpeace become certifiably insane?
"Given concerns regarding abrupt run-away climate change and loss of terrestrial ecosystems and species, the myth of environmental responsibility of certified industrial logging of primary forests must be revealed.
This approach has been tried for a decade and a half and it simply is not working.
Given trends in emerging climate change impacts and soaring public concern, why not embrace the moment and call for an end to industrial ancient forest logging?
This would significantly protect both life giving forests and the climate.
"
As the world comes together with Live Earth, proclaiming there is a climate crisis and looking for sufficient responses, environmental bureaucracies such as Greenpeace and WWF will have to do better than claiming a non-ambitious, reformist forest conservation policy will be adequate to protect our last intact large forests, to stop climate change, and to achieve global ecological sustainability.
Members of WWF, Greenpeace and other ancient forest logging apologists are encouraged to cancel their memberships.
Doing otherwise means you too have ancient forest blood on your hands.
Requirements for sustainability of global climate and terrestrial ecosystems demand an immediate end to ancient forest logging.
THAT would be good timing to czal for World Bank (following in the enlightend footsteps of HSBC and other financial intsittuions) to DISCLOSE AND START MITIGATING ITS HUSGE CARBON FOOTPRINT – incl.edvery misguided deforestation-for-cofffee plantation in Borneo/PNG –
I would be interested to know what other Live Earth performers and supporters are 'having it both ways' ie - invest in and profit from damage to the environment and then also profit from efforts to prevent such damage.
Hypocrisy in its crudest form...
I just wanna share this with other blog readers.
If you want to see a powerful poster promoting Global Warming exhibit, go to the link below:
I disagree.
An ill-conceived policy on ancient forest logging which greenwashes and lends support to continued failed industrial logging of such forests does more harm than good, and undermines all their other work in climate as well.
We have raised this issue with WWF and GP for several years to be rebuffed.
Now we are protesting because the science and requirements for global ecological sustainability are on our side - end ancient forest logging.
You might like to note the quality of response received thus far from WWF : http://www.rainforestportal.org/issues/2007/05/alert_stop_wwfs_betrayal_of_th.asp#comment-20674
Greenpeace, you and I all agree that in a perfect world there should be no logging of ancient forests, which is particularly true in the light of global warming that is finally getting some traction with the American public.
But changes, unfortunately happen slowly and in incremental steps, and Greenpeace sees itself as part of the process of making this happen.
In response to Endre: Greenpace supports industrial certified logging probably out of a desire to appear reasonable, a belief (misleading) that even heavy logging is better than outright deforestation, concern (genuine) for global economic inequities.
None of these trump the global ecosystems need to keep these ancient forests in place to continue operating.
This is an invitation to help start a movement--to take one spring day and use it to reshape the future.
Those of us who know that climate change is the greatest threat civilization now faces have science on our side; we have economists and policy specialists, courageous mayors and governors, engineers with cool new technology.
But we don't have a movement -- the largest rally yet held in the U.S. about global warming drew a thousand people.
If we're going to make the kind of change we need in the short time left us, we need something that looks like the civil rights movement, and we need it now.
Changing light bulbs just isn't enough.
Every group will be saying the same thing: Step it up, Congress!
Enact immediate cuts in carbon emissions, and pledge an 80% reduction by 2050.
No half measures, no easy compromises-the time has come to take the real actions that can stabilize our climate.
It may be business as usual.
But it shure is not climate as usual....... As we are all seeing.
It's been one climate disaster after another.
Everytime they interview a survivor it's alway's the same.
Ive been here 30 year's and never saw it this bad.
What part of this doe's big business not get.......What's it going to take a couple of major plant's to get pounded into the ground, along with a few of their favorite golf courses.
Maybe then they will wake up........!
Personally, as I am at sea-level, I want to make a very bright seven metre pole, with supporting information signage, and stand with it at our current high-tide level... In order to graphically demonstrate the local real estate reality of the new sea-levels should we all do nothing & the Greenland ice-cap melts.
Step It Up 2007 - Global Gathering - Day of Climate Action on April 14, 2007
This is an invitation to help start a movement--to take one spring day and use it to reshape the future.
Those of us who know that climate change is the greatest threat civilization now faces have science on our side; we have economists and policy specialists, courageous mayors and governors, engineers with cool new technology.
No half measures, no easy compromises - the time has come to take the real actions that can stabilize our climate.
So that we not only Step It Up!, that we also Keep It Up!, that we also Step On It!
so that we continue to facilitate & accelerate the changes in attitude & activity that need to be made every where by every body.
There are six and a half billion individual responses to be made to climate change - and only ten years to encourage them.
Not a moment to lose hey!
Firstly, I'd like to say you have a great site and seem incredibly dedicated to Climate Change and Global Warming.
You mentioned that "the largest rally yet held in the U.S. about global warming drew a thousand people".
It is of course sad that so few people are prepared to unite for such an important cause, but the question I ask myself is why?
I'm not sure if "An Inconvenient Truth" is such a good example, but it did get a lot of publicity and keeps the Climate problem in the news.
With this thought in mind I recently wrote a novel called "Global Warming - The Final Solution".
I really wanted to just write a book exploring all the facts, but I have written quite a few articles on the subject and they just didn't seem to have the right effect.
Whilst there is no doubt that mankind is doing its best to worsen the problem of Global Warming, I am not convinced this is the main cause.
As far as I can see, this problem is appearing on other planets in our system, which seems to suggest we should be looking at other areas as well.
3) 30 years ago the first earth day was predicting a coming ice age, with the same tragic notion that if we did not make a signifigant change in our habits within the next ten years, we would all freeze in our beds.
Funny how the ten year "mantra" is again being used only in reverse.
As to the alleged similarities between climate models used by the modern generation of climate scientists and the weather forecasting models used by folks generating 5 day forecasts for a TV audience - if you think they are identical you don't understand the basics of climate science and the complexity level that computer models incorporate.
That is not to say that current models cannnot improve - they can, and will - but that climate models are entirely different from the models used to forecast short-term weather trends.
As to the prediction of an ice-age in the 70s, that was based on a single article in Newsweek, published in the US, that has been reproduced over and over in the media to demonstrate, supposedly, that climate scientists are somehow discredited forever because they cannot make up their minds as to whether things are getting colder or warmer.
It's a very convenient argument, but one that ignores the advance of knowledge over a 35 year period, as if science stands still and is only advanced when a magazine happens to publish something now and then.
Talk about ridiculous!
The fact that this article survives today is testament to the ability of climate deniers to manipulate the media in the US (not in the EU or elsewhere in the world, mind you) and the low level of understanding of science in our country at present.
Where did you get your information, by the way?
I am now a member of the Climate Crisis Coalition of the Twin Cities and into prairie landscaping for wildlife and my enjoyment.
I use my extra time to create graphs showing rapid temperature changes using NWS climate records and hydrologic change using USGS and Crops of Engineers hydrologic data available from the Internet.
The public can view my graphs at my Newsvine and YahooPhotos web addresses.
My belief that rapid global warming and climate/hydrologic change in the Upper Midwest have been occurring got me in trouble at work (NWS North Central River Forecast Center office in Chanhassen, MN) beginning in January of 2000.
I was removed from my job on July 15, 2005 by NWS for insisting and being outspoken in my concerns and goals to dealing with climate and hydrologic change.
In addition to the release of the IPCC Fourth Assessment, 1st volume summary which essentially declares complete confidence (>90%) that humans are causing climate change with grave impacts, there have been a number of other positive steps in climate policy this week.
There has been a seashift in Australian climate policy with the Howard government on the hotseat literally for a bereft climate policy over the years, and now the disasterous "big dry" drought.
Under pressure with a new election looming, Howard's government is proposing a carbon trading system - which before you get too excited, apparently would not cap emissions .
But along with China indicating they are setting up a carbon market , and with California talking hooking up with Europe's carbon market, the prospects of global carbon market in the next couple years looms large.
Brazil's Lula along with China laid the blame for climate disruption where it belongs, at the developed nation's feet.
Jacque Chirac's call for an emergency global summit on climate , supported by some 46 countries, appears likely.
Such a summit must seek to get all countries to cap emissions with special allowances for developing countries to have easier caps and more time in order to not lock in carbon emission disparities between the rich and poor.
With the science settled, there has also started to be even more discussion of climate change solutions and their implementation , where the focus should shift like a laser beam.
Perhaps this was the week where the World started getting their act together on equitable mandatory climate emission reductions.
They can not come soon enough.
There are times in human lives when real life-love-death issues become far and away more important than consumption and indulgence, and it becomes relatively easy to willingly give things up.
Eventually we will grasp the actual nature of climate change.
Virtual climate change leads to virtually no policy change... but watch this space!
Though I hod no doctorate or scientific ceritification I do subscribe to common sense there can be no argument that we humans have affected our environment.
But as for global warming I'm from Michigan which I was taught was under a sheet if ice about a mile thick just a couple hundred thousand years ago so things have been warming for a long time.
It seems I also learned about several periods of extreme temp shifts which affected the course of evolution.
Perhaps we have affected the course of the latest shift or maybe we a seeing just another cycle in the life of our planet who can be absolutly sure.
To fan the flames of debate; As few as 150 years ago, until Louis Aggasiz' writing, it was widely believed that continental glacial deposits in North America were attributable to The Great Flood of Noah.
Believe it or not, where I live in St. Cloud, MN was covered by nearly 1km of ICE as few as 15,000 years ago!
15,000 years... The 'scientific' age of the earth is ~4.5 billion years... As I look back on the geologic timescale I find that climate change is the norm, rather than the exception.
LISTEN TO SKEPTICS!
PROVE THEM WRONG!
That's the essence of science!
I think the IPCC report is pure bunk and over emphasizes CO2 and the human contribution to 'greenhouse gasses.
'
I challenge all of you do do some research into this topic.
Do not define your theory before you test it, which is what they have done for these models of global warming.
In fact, look into other causes.
Such as all the volcanic activity on the ocean floor.
Couldn't that raise the temp in the oceans?
Couldn't that send the warmer waters to Anartica and melt some of the ice?
And if the waters are warmer, couldn't that make some stronger storms?
Global warming scientists do not want you to know this because it puts too many holes in their theory.
Science is about "I don't think that is correct so I am going to prove you wrong!
" Come on people!
Follow the money!
Who is the loudest speaker about global warming?
AL GORE.
Who is going to make a lot of money when he convinces people to buy hybrid cars?
AL GORE.
Don't be fooled by him.
All that he cares about is AL GORE.
How much money did he make of that stupid movie?
All this is fear mongoling.
Scare the public into believing you so that do what you want.
The democrates accuse the replubican of that all the time, when in fact it is they who are doing it themselves.
And, even if you don't believe in Global Warming, you should be doing these things to minimize air, and water pollution, and to prevent mountains and streams from being destroyed by big coal companies.
You should also consider who is getting all of our oil money, and what they're doing with it.
I would rather pay more for alternatives than to support those who promote hate and terrorism.
What about you?
The United Nations has just released its long-awaited report on climate change, warning global warming is almost certainly caused by humans.
"Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice, and rising global mean sea level," the report said.
What little debate still existed regarding human causality for climate change has been squashed as the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has issued their strongest statement yet that human activities are changing the climate.
The report, Volume 1 of IPCC's Fourth Assessment, entitled Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basic [download official summary in pdf] states the cause of climate change is "very likely" man-made (>90% chance) and "would continue for centuries" ( summary of main findings ).
It is quite interesting to note the changing levels of certainty of human causation of climate change by the IPCC over the last 20 years by this conservative grouping of world scientists.
Though authoritative and exhaustively peer reviewed, if anything IPCC documents have and continue to error on the side of caution - partly the nature of science, the need to produce a consensus document, and lobbying by government bureaucrats protecting their interests.
It is likely that scenarios of abrupt, runaway climate change [search] are given short thrift in such an environment.
Climate Ark's news tracking and search feature provides full coverage of the lead up to, and the release of, the much anticipated report.
Now on to climate change solutions [search] - 80% carbon reductions by 2050, massive renewable energy investments, banning coal, focus upon energy conservation and efficiency, and an emergency global summit to get all countries on board with equitable mandatory emissions caps.
The biggest threat in global warming is WAR!!!!
Has anyone thought about the amount of pollution seeping into our atmosphere from all those burning oil fields and artillary explosions???
But it doesn't just destroy the climate in Iraq and the middle east.
Besides the extra heat it creates, all of this pollution drifts around the world and contaminates the air and water everywhere... as absurd as it may seem, even the terrorists need to become aware of this.
Even if the win the "fight," what kind of country will they have if everyone is dying from diseases caused by pollution?
There is no question that the earth is in another cyclical warming trend based on shrinkage of the glaciers in most parts of the world, except in Antarctica.
Multiple ice ages and evidence of the tropical conditions in the past in the extreme northern latitudes confirms the cooling and warming cycles of Earth long preceded the man induced carbon dioxide additions to the atmosphere.
But, where is the proof of man's complicity in this warming trend.
I do not care how many scientists have a consensus that man is causing this.
Science is based on facts and proof, not consensus.
And where is this article's historical perspective on how ancient Europeans' benefited from former periods of global warming â€“ bumper crops in extended agricultural lands, currently uninhabited lands are opened to man with rising temperatures?
This is about doom and gloom, more money for the scientists to study.
What happened to the polar bears 10,000 years ago when the Great Ice age ended?
Nothing. What happened to the polar bears during the 10th to 13th centuries when the planet underwent a climate warming?
Nothing. What happened to the polar bears during warming trend during the Dust Bowl years?
Nothing. Who was driving all the SUVs back then?
Why, all of a sudden are they threatened now?
Climate change is a natural process from the *SUN.
* The Sun is a slightly variable star and will make things hotter and colder.
Survival of the fittest people.
Some animals will die and some will adapt and survive.
Prior to 100,000 years ago Polar Bears haven't even evolved yet.
Who's crying for the loss of the Brown Bears that disappeared as the Polar Bears came into existence?
Puleeeze. Al Gore and Laurie David cry to give up your SUV's and buy a bike.
Then they fly off around the country in their chartered jets that spew more pollution in one transcontinental flight than an SUV running for months.
This photo is simply one of polar bears in their natural environment!
What do they eat?
Fish. Where do they get them?
at the edge of ice.
Perhaps that's WHY they have the ability to SWIM long distances!
These bears are NOT in dire straits.
The fact that there is so little discussion about the observed global warming of Mars is extremely disturbing.
Unless we are willing to think outside the box and realize the universe is much larger than our earth, we can never hope to solve the problem.
This discussion of global warming only on earth harkens back to the days when the consensus was that the universe revolved around the earth!
This "so-called" global warming threat is entirely political and will lead to the US signing the Koyoto Treaty, which will cost American taxpayers untold millions.
THAT is the dirty little secret the media is not telling the public.
Evolution is a "theory" too - it cannot be proven in the same way that a law of physics or a mathematical theorem can be.
However, the fact that several thousand scientists worldwide agree on the causes of global warming is almost unprecedented in the world of science.
I can't believe there are still Kevins left, pontificating discredited science.
Ice Age?
Mammoths died eating daises and buttercups, so suddenly they had no time to swallow.
Frozen to death in high summer?
There was no ice-age, it was a cataclism.
And that's how he misses the point on global warming: By ignoring the evidence.
We're trying to save your life and those of your children, though in Kevin's case, I think a Darwin award for improvment of the genepool by his absence may be more appropriate.
All we want is for people to stop pissing in the sandpit.
We all have to share it.
I have to agree with kevin 100%!!!!!!!!!!
the earth's climate run along with the output of the sun the sun has been a hell of a lot more active in recent years and we havnt see what our sun is capable of yet, im 99% shure of that too.
kevin dont let people fool you in to "green taxes" "cut emmissions now before its to late" rubbish.
how many volcanon's are eruting around the worl at the miniute ?!?!?!
can any 1 answer that question???
there is around 18 erupting right now... i wonder have mush S**T thats pummping in to the atmosphire???
far more that we ever have.
its the earth's way of burning its own fossil fuels.... u ever think of that?
CYCLE CYCLE CYCLE THE EARTH SUN CYCLE dont listen to the SO CALLED leader of the world that are taking back handers left right and center!
The report is very good.
But we have, a hell of a problem,it's two fold.
One is dealing with greenhouse gases, and the other is dealing with radical climate change, which is here now.
We just had an EF3... tornado down here last night.
In the month of Dec, we had an EF2 in the same area.
Ive been here 35 year's and never seen anything over an EF1 .
Let's face it, last summer record heat this year record cold and winter is not over yet.
The gulfstream on Dec 19 2006 turned south for 11 day's.
The same current is running 30% slower as of 2003 .
One of the set's of 3 salwater chimney's that are the engine's of the gulfstream has all but vanished due to fresh water intrusion.
The pentagon put out a report in forbe's magazine in 2003 titled (climate change and national security threats from it}.
Let's not forget Katina, Wilma and Rita and the list goes on and on, all over the world.
What ever the cause, we have to prepare for the worst case scenario, we have no choice.
Someone let the bull out of the pen and instead of looking for it we are all standing around, trying to figure out who did it, enough...WE NEED ACTION NOW.
All our live's, may very well depend on it.
This could very well be, ( The Beginning Of The End ) IT'S OUR CALL...................
Food for thought.....We will see riot's in the street's for food, due to climate change.
Long before we either roast or see ice sheet's covering the landscape.
Just look at California, they produce 90% of our fruit's and vegetable's.
The midwest, the cattle are starving to death, no hay, all the grazing areas are buried under snow.
300 million people are alot of mouth's to feed, especialy the way we eat.
For the first time, the cow'a are skinnier then the people..........
To eliminate the problem, we must first eliminate all the things causing the problem.
People are going to HAVE to accept change, the ways of live will be drastically altered.
Ban the use of combustible engine motor vehicles.
As soon as we take the polluting factors out, are we going to be able to find a way to reverse the affects.
I suggest doing as I said at first and working on a way to help in 2012 when the venus mars and moon align and act like a circuit breaker to cool the earth off, to develop some sort of technology that will aid this process.
Thank you and I hope that you took the time and consider what I said important information, but you probably already know all this information.
also i think its important to mention that life is a variable dependent upon its environments condition.
climate change is a issue for all life on earth.
there two kinds of forces causeing global warming right now: global climate change as a cycle and a homosapien veriable.
our inability to identify to cause of global warming is that thier is more then one cause.
Effect early melt down of our ice caps, the suns reflector is the color white, not an ice cap, an ice cap is a naturally occuring source of protection from the suns light energy.. but from the suns point of view its only white!
we can produce a artifical artic landscape to compinsate.. also we can engeneer it in a way the the suns energy could reflect it and also increase the earths rotation to a constant by way of energy directional flow!
)
Yes, undoubtedly.
The only constant in climate is change.
Average surface temperatures rose by around 0.6°C over the period from 1900 to 2000, possibly a few tenths of a degree less if we correct for the “urban heat island effect”.
This warming trend already started around 1800, with 0.5-0.6°C warming over the period from 1800 to 1900, as well.
Prior to 1800 the earth was in a global Little Ice Age, which started around 1300, with temperatures cooler than today.
Is this increase in atmospheric CO2 levels man-made?
But the latest IPCC report (2007) states that it is very likely that man-made CO2 is causing the recent and projected future temperature rise and that this will lead to all sorts of problems: melting ice caps; rising sea levels and flooding; reduction of snow cover and thawing of permafrost; higher ocean salinity; increase in severe weather events including droughts, heavy precipitation, heat waves and the intensity of tropical cyclones; loss of habitat and possibly even extinction for many species; increase of tropical diseases; increased deaths from heat waves; etc.
· models created to show that greenhouse effect from “anthropogenic CO2” is the primary driving force for climate change when there is no scientific evidence or proof for this supposition and a significant amount of paleoclimate evidence to show that CO2 does not drive climate change
· effect of variations in solar activity are relegated to a very minor role in driving climate despite fact that past records for millions of years show this is the major driver of climate on Earth
· claims made that Greenland ice cap has melted from 1993 to 2003, causing an increase in sea levels of 0.21 mm per year while latest ESA study of essentially same period shows an increase in Greenland ice, equivalent to a lowering of sea levels by 0.27 mm per year
· claims that reductions in the Antarctic ice sheet have contributed to a further 0.21 mm per year rise in sea levels over the period 1993 to 2003, when latest ESA studies show a net increase in Antarctic ice, corresponding to a lowering of sea levels by 0.08 mm per year
· claims that world-wide tropical cyclone activity has increased both in frequency and intensity due to global warming, when the record outside USA shows a net reduction in both frequency and intensity and the US record shows a reduction from 1940 to 1995 followed by an increase from 1996 to 2005 (including 2005 with Katrina and Rita), followed by a drop in 2006, with overall 1940-2006 record showing essentially no statistical increase in either intensity or frequency; also, theory says these are driven by the temperature gradient between tropics and poles, which will decrease with warming
· claims that other extreme weather events, such as heat spells, extreme precipitation events, thunderstorms and tornados are increasing due to global warming when there are no comprehensive reports to show this and many local reports show there is no statistical change in extreme weather events
All in all, we should ignore most of what is in the IPCC 2007 summary report, just as we should ignore the sensationalist press reports on global warming and its dire consequences and the calls by politicians for immediate action to stop this “impending disaster”.
But why do so many scientists and political leaders plus many in the media support the man-made global warming theory?
It’s driven by an estimated 2.5 to 4 billion dollars per year in climate research grants, with the grants going selectively to those scientists who make the most disastrous predictions.
We’d be much better off diverting our time and resources from this non-problem of “CO2 pollution” to address the true problems of today, such as poverty, hunger, genocide, slavery, disease, terrorism driven by religious fanaticism, illiteracy, lack of clean drinking water and electrical power for millions of people, world dependence on a dwindling supply of imported fossil fuels, killing off of the rain forests, real pollution of the environment, etc.
Just think what we could do in these real problem areas with 2.5 to 4 billion additional dollars per year, not to mention the hundreds of billions it would take to truly implement the provisions of the Kyoto Protocol
I think Max Anacker sums it up.
Mind you most on here would probably say he works for some oil company like they do to the other people who claim that humans are the main cause of climate change.
Men of courage such as Prince Charles have called for a rapid response to climate change akin to fighting WWII , George Monbiot continues to show through methodical research that dramatic emission cuts are the only way forward, and lesser men such as myself have pointed out the need for serious structural changes in how society is organized to fight climate change; including population controls, carbon taxes, a ban on coal , an end to ancient rainforest logging [alert] and rapid, ambitious renewable targets , if we and the Earth are to survive.
Forget about geoengineering proposals including seeding the ocean with iron (plankton blooms = ocean dead zones), orbiting Earth mirrors to reflect radiation, and distant plans to filter and sequester carbon from coal and the atmosphere.
Doing so will lead to severe negative and chaotic follow-on effects, and distracts from the obvious - climate change is caused by greenhouse gas emissions and it will only be successfully addressed by starting to dramatically reduce these emissions now.
In addition to the Chinese and American governments, and the UN IPCC process; individuals such as Laurie David , Leonardo DiCaprio, Richard Branson and even Al Gore who sell easy, painless chimerical solutions are full of it.
Climate change and the whole raft of attendant global ecological emergencies will only be solved through extreme personal sacrifice and learned voluntary simplicity, and major societal restructuring of economics, agriculture, transport and others.
Those looking for easy answers that allow continued profligate energy consumption and living large are delaying the hard choices necessary to save being.
Cimate change incrementalists do a disservice to truth and the Earth.
"So how do you react to the Bush administration`s stance on global warming?
"
I don`t know what this Laurie David creature is, or what it looks like, but judging by its words it seems inordinately proud of itself for its heroic contribution to trashing the planet.
On behalf of six billion human beings who do not live the American dream, the ones who are actually going to suffer the pain & trauma of climate change, I want to say something... I would love to have dinner with Laurie.
Something in my heart tells me if I had ten minutes with her ... It is VERY DIFFICULT to express how horrified I am.
Without swearing or being insulting...
"Climate change and the whole raft of attendant global ecological emergencies will only be solved through extreme personal sacrifice and learned voluntary simplicity, and major societal restructuring of economics, agriculture, transport and others.

I apologise if I upset anyone... John Howard prayed for rain & he got it!
There is hope for me yet!!
Please God... Will you give these celebrities an ecological road to Damascus experience they will never forget?
Just for five minutes, in a dream if necessary, let these pampered poodles of the West experience reality... Heat - with no air conditioning.
Hunger - with empty shelves.
Thirst - but no ice cold beers in the cooler.... Sunshine & blueskies - with no credit, no shelter, no food, no drink...
If you are seeing the truth about what is occurring on this planet, in whatever sphere (political, corporate, economic, climate change), than the only thing is to take individual action such that there is no longer a psychological split between what is true and what you would like to believe is true.
We can’t keep backing up media lies by sitting on our hands waiting for another Daddy to come along and make everything OK. No guru, no politician, no organization, no belief system of any kind is going to change the simple fact that only those individuals who see what’s up and act outside of what is generally acceptable, taking a flying leap into the unknown and attempting to live what they know is true, are going to survive this disaster known as the human experiment.
After much research it seems that the most severe cataclysms are occurring in the areas towards the poles.
New Zealand and Australia, Indonesia and Japan, India and China, all are experiencing drought, earthquakes, floods, and all types of extreme weather.
In the states, it’s either water shortages and hurricanes in the south and west, or frigid cold, blizzards, and tornadoes across the mid-west and east.
And it’s getting more extreme.
Though there seems no areas immune to the possibility of radiation from increasing solar flares, it seems mid to high elevations in tropical climates with old growth rain forest near the equator are the best bets.
So we are looking for land in the highlands of Costa Rica and want to attract others who are ready to hunker down and build a sustainable life.
We intend for the focus to be awakening, using silent sitting as the only reasonable method.
We do not have a teaching, just an understanding that only through silence can the original blueprint of a real human being come forth from the veil of sleep created by the decades of programming by our social systems and governments.
Unless one gets a glimpse outside the program (some liken it to the Matrix as illustrated in the movie by the same name), one will think, speak, and act within it’s influence, not realizing how pervasive it is in the consciousness of mankind as a whole.
Until the bubble pops, the illusion is perceived as real and governs our course of action.
Actually, the South Island of New Zealand is supposed to have suffer the least impact overall with the increase of global warming.
It will be mighty windy, and of course more dry....but they'll not be suffering as much as the North.
And, I would avoid tropical locations entirely.
Disease anyone?
Even as the Bush government continues its criminal climate change obstruction [search] , yet another U.S. institution has entered the fray regarding the seriousness of dramatically reducing carbon emissions to mitigate against the worst possible impacts of sudden or abrupt climate change.
This time is is eleven former high-ranking U.S. military and international security issue specialists warning that " climate change threatens to prolong the war on terrorism and foster political instability that some governments will be unable to cope with... it has the potential to create sustained natural and humanitarian disasters on a scale far beyond those we see today.
" In the United States this is likely to play itself out with severe fluctuations in water from drought to flooding .
These are the sort of fighting words of apocalyptic warning that have gotten me in trouble for years in my personal writings.
Through its disruption of ecological systems, economies and societies; climate change has the potential to gravely impact international security [search] .
This is why on the spurring of the UK, climate change will shortly be taken up by the Security Council of the United Nation.
People from Al Gore to Military personnel can see the threat to our very being, yet from 1990-2005 U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions Up 16% .
What a myopic, slovenly country that can know all the implications of inaction, studying them with weekly new reports of ever more detail and certainly, and yet fail so utterly to make the changes in energy sources, conservation and efficiency necessary to avert global crisis.

Before that,it completely shut down in 1200 A.D.. The start of the Little Ice Age, which lasted some 500 year's .
Before that, it was some 10,000 ago.
The start of the Younger Dreyus Ice Age which lasted for a thousand year's.
If this year's winter, is a Bi-Product of the faltering of the North Atlantic current.
Then this is the greatest threat to humanity since the beginning of time....... !
Dr. Barry, I'm confused as to the correlation of a potential "Little Ice Age" and climate warming?
Trouble is, as highlighted by a blog I came across this week called The Difference , there are also "weekly new reports of ever more detail and certainty" that projected climate changes have been widely exaggerated and that man's contribution is but negligible - such as today's report that 3.5 million years ago the Antarctic was 2-3C warmer than today, with the ice possibly even having withdrawn onto the Antarctic landmass.
The idea of taking to the streets across the nation is a laudable action.
At least it delivers the message to the legislators to take action which according public response is overdue.
The fact that this has made sense to the ordinary man really emphasizes the gravity of the climate change issue – we cannot keep this under the carpet anymore.
It is critical for the US to take a lead in climate change mitigation since even some nations that have committed to cap their CO2 may get discouraged if the largest emitter is not part of whole deal.
Alternatively, if the US a different approach (accommodative of the economy), it will be important to show convincing results (even in the short term) to the world that we are pulling in the same direction.
Though the effects of climate change 'will come upon us extremely slowly' but the pace will be so fast that we will have no time for adaptive mutation to cope with the new climate world (if that will come before our extinction).
Our legislators should be aware that soon after the 'the poorest of the poor in the world' have been hit by climate change; the next victims will obviously be the next in the hierarchy (who would have taken the place of today’s poor by then).
Now that the reality of climate change is glaring at us, wouldn't it be praiseworthy if we genuinely ask our legislators to consider promoting an efficient public transportation system the next time we take to the streets.
Why is it that you all feel entitled to a static global climate?
There has never been a static global climate in the history of the Earth, why is it you want one now?
RESPONSE: Cranky, do as much trolling and baiting as you want, but I encourage people to ignore you.
Do you know anything about the climate change issue?
It's not that we want a static climate, it is that the climate is changing many times faster than it has in the past, in a manner that is destroying ecosystems.
Have you every studied any ecology to know where your food, water and air come from?
Go and find some skeptics to play with, your dogmatic ignorance is not welcome here.
Come on Dr. Barry, if you wanted to effect a real and lasting change in GHG emissions you would be less concerned about taxes on corporations that emit GHG and more concerned about shifting our infrastructure from burning fossil fuels and alcohol to a completely GHG emissionless power source.
The technology has been around for 70 years and is very mature, safe and clean.
Skip the taxes, the subsidies, the clearing of rainforests to plant sugarbeats and sugarcane, the livestock feed shortages, the third world economic destruction and all the other stuff that will only delay the implementation of shifting our infrastructure to nuclear energy and H2 fuel cells.
20% of the USA's electricity comes from 102 nuclear power plants, imagine if over the last 30 years we had been building more with a goal of 600 power plants.
We could have been fossil fuel free already.
The only byproduct of nuclear power is a little bit of radioactive waste and residual heat.
Why is NO ONE from the global warming alarmist camps talking about real change instead of taxes?
There is only one answer to that question and it doesn't take a climatologist to see it.
My question is the one that global warming alarmists DON'T want asked.
Which is why you say I am not welcome here and call me ignorant.
I say "ignorant" is treating the symptom when you have the cure in your pocket.
"There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will, in the foreseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth's atmosphere and disruption of the Earth's climate.
Moreover, there is substantial scientific evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many beneficial effects upon the natural plant and animal environments of the Earth.
"
TAKE ACTION!
The rise in demand for air travel is one of the most serious environmental threats facing the Earth.
Global aviation's negative impact upon global climate and ecology [search] is becoming more evident and known.
Aviation accounts for about 2% of world emissions of carbon dioxide, over 6% in the U.K. and other over-developed countries, and projected passenger growth of five percent a year means airplane emissions are growing more rapidly than any other source.
Air transport contributes disproportionately heavily to global warming, as carbon dioxide and water vapor emitted at high altitude are four times more potent than at sea level... The " Camp for Climate Action " outside London's Heathrow airport is this week highlighting aviation's centrality to fighting global warming.
Heathrow is the world's busiest airport and a bigger source of CO2 emissions than most countries, yet the airport's capacity is to be doubled by building a third runway... The danger of "celebrity environmentalism" is clear as the launch of Leonardo DiCaprio’s eco-documentary entitled "The 11th Hour" coincides with the Heathrow aviation protests.
Mr. DiCaprio glibly defends his and other celebrity's use of private jets, and despite a solar powered house and hybrid car, all his personal efforts to reduce his carbon footprint are shattered by a jet-setting lifestyle.
Clearly addressing climate change and other global ecological crises will require shared sacrifice and a reduction in consumption by many... Let Leo know that the battle to stop the growth in aviation's greenhouse gas emission is one the most important environmental battles ever that require his personal example... Let him know you will see his movie if he swears off private jets.
TAKE ACTION!
Of course we have a monstrous debacle with air travel!
We also face another looming debacle: What happens when the high altitude particulates deposited by jets are no longer reflecting much of the sun's energy?
There is justifiable cause for concern that as those particulates diminish, global warming will be vastly accellerated, as evidenced during the grounding of all flights post 9/11.
When do we give people a break and thank them for the great work they are doing.
So he flew in a plane, what was the offset of getting messages like climate chaos into the mainstream of America.
What about greenpeace, wwf, nrdc and all the other jet setting organizations fighting climate change while flying around the planet to have countless meetings that do what?
Do they achieve more than this mainstream celebrity who at least reaches thousands of people who may other wise never know the real story.
RESPONSE: No one is asking Leanardo to live in hut.
We are asking him to stop traveling by private jet in light of the grave ecological situation.
Private jets emit as much pollution in one hour as an SUV does in a year.
bring much, much attention to the crisis of global warming/(ruination of the
RESPONSE: Apparently we disagree.
It seems rather obvious that nobody particularly an environmental activist should fly in private jets which pollute as much in one hour as an SUV does in a year.
Nothing could possibly justify
Years ago we used to talk regretfully about the fissiparous left.
I think those of us deeply concerned about global warming have to take a broad church approach and welcome anyone who shares and publicises that concern.
The issue is too serious to allow time for infighting.
Personal consumption habits matter, but action on government fronts is more important, and if DiCaprio can contribute to wider public awareness and greater public pressure on governments I'm not prepared to make his private jet habits into a major issue.
As a geologist I find the current discussion about global warming a lot to do about not much.
I look at time in much larger chunks than most scientists.
Once you realize that 1) During most of the last 1 billion years the earth had NO permanent ice, and 2) We are still coming out of an ice age that saw glaciers as far south as Kansas City about 14000 years ago, you realize that we are simply in a warming cycle that has been going on for thousands of years.
During this time the overall temperature of the earth's atmosphere has warmed and cooled along a general warming trend.
Where this warming trend ends is anybody's guess.
However, if the recent past (past few million years) is any indication, this trend will eventually reverse itself, and we will again go into another cycle of glaciation.
If you think global warming is a danger to crops, just think of the "bread basket" of the U.S. being under a sheet of ice.
Thank you for your response.
And thank you for posting comments that run counter to your opinions.
An open forum is the only way that real change can occur.
The Heathrow protests are fantastic, however, I still disagree with your focus on Leo DiCaprio.
I think it is very counter productive to what you are trying to achieve.
Your websites are amazing, and I have gained invaluable information from them.
But the important thing now is to change public opinion and create public action.
I have seen the 11th Hour and it can do just that.
Yes, private jet use by celebrities is harmful to the environment.
But how many private jet users are making documentaries about global warming?
As I said in an earlier comment, I am not condoning wasteful behavior by the rich and famous, but the most important thing now is to get the message out, which DiCaprio is doing.
By doing that you can affect political change and create new laws that may prevent or severley tax things such as private plane travel.
When we live in a country and a world that has yet to grasp the magnitude of this problem we should not be castigating those who are trying to wake people up.
At this critical time saying "it is either sustainable and right for the environment or it is not" reminds me of Bush's comment "your either with us or against us.
" Nothing is completely black and white.
Our very presence as a species on this planet, as it turns out, is not right for the environment.
We all need to bind together at this crucial moment and help get the message out about the seriousness of global warming
As you are evidently well versed with regard to global warming and other environmental disasters, I assume you have read George Monbiot’s Heat.
How to Stop the Planet Burning.
Air travel was the one facet of modern lifestyle for which he could find no solution - it is simply one of the worst contributors to global warming.
While I knew this and had already given up air travel, I was in shock at the information he presented.
I applaud the actions of the concerned citizens at Climate Change Camp at Heathrow who are objecting to the continuance of air travel, and would suggest that you join them - but you’d have to take a plane.
Bill McKibben ran into this dilemma when he wanted to launch his “Step it UP 2007" Climate Change campaign.
He didn’t want folks using a lot of fossil fuel to get to the action - so he and his group suggested actions everywhere and people flocked to set them up with marvelous creativity.
http://april.stepitup2007.org/article.php?id=102protestors
People tie themselves in knots at the idea that they will have to “sacrifice” their cars and planes.
Excuse me??
Look at the thousands of non-voluntary sacrifices that were taken in Katrina, in heat waves, floods, and other climate-related disasters, whose number is growing despite the drumbeat that it’s all just “natural cycles.” (Here in Minnesota, seven people so far have drowned in flash floods in the last several days, while crops in other parts of the state suffer from drought.
)
Some are saying they won’t see your movie or support your work unless you swear off flying.
Well, I’m not into throwing out the baby with the bath water - I haven’t seen your movie yet, but from all accounts it should get people thinking, and - hopefully - acting.
I support that.
But I definitely urge you to give up flying and make a big deal of it.
Well we can't expect Mr. Dicaprio to walk, ride his bike, or drive his hybrid to other countries.
Nonetheless, it is quite disgusting how polluting aviation is.
They could certainly find other means of transportation or limit their use..or dare I say, be "normal" and ride first class instead of using his private jet?
Thanks for making this an issue.
Although what Al Gore and Lenardo DeCaprio do personally is not really the issue, their behavior provides an easy target for those who would propose we do nothing to address the issue of climate change.
Having leaders who walk the talk is essential in changing peoples mindset.
Reducing humanities foodprint is equal parts technology and cultural mindset.
Hollywood types and the rich should be among the first to voluntarily restrain thier consumption.
Tasmania, Australia's woodchipping giant Gunns Ltd. is poised to be granted fast track approval by the Tasmanian government to build a massive chemical pulp mill in northern Tasmania.
This forest-hungry pulp mill will be a disaster for Australia's ancient forests, climate, wildlife and future.
If built, the US$1.4 billion project would need four million tonnes of logs a year.
It would double Gunns' current rate of clearcutting in Tasmania's native forests.
It will also dump thousands of tonnes of poisonous waste into Bass Strait every day, threatening marine life, tourism and the fishing industry.
For way too long Tasmania's ancient forests - some containing massive eucalyptus trees - have been clearcut to produce paper pulp, mostly for the Japanese market... Continued markets for paper pulp from ancient forest liquidation depend upon this disastrous pulp mill being forced through the Australian legal system... the impact of this massive pulp mill on Tasmania's ancient native forests, much less regional and global climate, have not been considered.
Additionally Minister Turnbull has acknowledged there is insufficient data available to assess the impacts of 64,000 tonnes a day of poisonous waste being released into Bass Strait... (the) Gunns had already signed a contract with construction firm John Holland to start building the pulp mill "in the first week of September"... At a time when Australia's federal government is proposing funding ancient forest protection and conservation internationally as a measure to a combat climate change, it is hypocritical and repulsive that Australia continues industrially clearing its own native forests.
Australia's ancient forests will still be logged, even clearcut, for throw away consumer products; even as the Australian government calls upon less developed and poor nations to protect their forests for the climate.
TAKE ACTION .
Expanding infrastructure to support the logging of old-growth forest and the intoxication of the environment is a choice that is unsustainable for future generations and the biological diversity necessary to maintain the Earth's ecological balance.
Please, include environmental impacts in your business analysis, and focus on creating enterprise that will support our communities and the Earth
The IPCC tells us that we are pumping too much CO2 into the atmosphere.
Well, trees ingest CO2.
Why finance expensive means to remove CO2 when the forests do it for nothing?
A new BBC poll finds 2 out of 3 respondents from 21 countries including big polluters such as the U.S., India and China believe "major steps starting very soon" need to be taken to combat global warming .
Further, 8 in 10 accept that "human activity... is a significant cause of climate change.
" What is needed is not simply action, but radical action; policy adequate to save the climatic system and heal the biosphere.
This will require massive reductions in energy use and emissions, achievable only by shrinking human populations and total consumption (but more equitable); as well as an end to coal burning, primary forest logging and reductions in aviation.
The being held in New York is rife with calls for action [ news search ]; but of the posturing and greenwashing sort.
Who will lead, truthfully and wisely?
I wish it were otherwise, but I believe humanity is doomed to discover the extremes of its capacity to degrade our biosphere.
I doubt that it will retain its technological capacity to the end.
Humanity faces catastrophe.
Evidently, concerns like long-term human wellbeing, biodiversity preservation and the integrity of Earth's body are MOMENTARILY at odds with powerful economic and political forces which relentlessly and unrealistically maintain an economic system marked by unrestricted and increasing per capita consumption, unbridled and expanding economic globalization, and continuous and rapid growth of the human population.
take a bit more responsibility for the atmospheric havoc they are causing
Thanks for your thoughtful comments.
Just wanted inform you of a recently launched blog which may be of interest to you, End Poverty in South Asia (http://endpovertyinsouthasia.worldbank.org/), which addresses common issues you're discussing and has a recent post on issue of climate change.
The blog is maintained by Shanta Devarajan, the Chief Economist of the South Asia Region at the World Bank.
Its goal is to create conversation around how South Asia can end poverty in a generation.
Briefly, part of the post on climate change is below:
"As world leaders meet this week in New York and Washington to discuss climate change and ways to mitigate its effects, the discussion frequently turns to the large, fast-growing economies such as China and India who are, and are likely to be, among the largest emitters of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases.
But despite being the world's second most populous country and fourth largest economy, India's CO2 emissions is still only one-fifth that of the U.S. or China.
Furthermore, India is one of the lowest-intensity producers of CO2 among the large countries.
India's per-capita emissions of CO2 is about one metric ton per person, compared with 4 as the world average, 9 for the United Kingdom and 20 for the U.S.. In a group of 70 of the world's largest emitters, India ranks in the bottom 10 (http://go.worldbank.org/0XAV4BYO60).
In terms of carbon emissions per unit of GDP (measured at Purchasing Power Parity, or PPP), too, India is virtually the lowest among comparator countries (see chart).
Finally, unlike in other countries, India's carbon intensity did not rise as economic growth accelerated in the last decade.
"
Both are almost certainly exacerbated, if not caused, by climate change and a whole host of other environmental crises including deforestation and poor water management.
In one case it is too much water, and the other not enough, precisely the type of extreme weather events [search] predicted for decades to occur as a result of global heating.
In both cases agriculture and agricultural settlements are initially being most disrupted.
Australia as an over-developed country may have more resources to put off the most egregious impacts of ecological collapse; but food and water scarcity eventually hits the rich as well.
Continental scale environmental disasters portend continental ecological collapse to come.
Meanwhile President Bush plays make believe climate change leader [ more ] -- how pathetically non-credible after seven years of climate policy obstruction [search] and action now seemingly limited to continued stalling of mandatory emission controls .
Bush's climate policy is a sick, sad, tragic, maddening joke.
The day the Toxic Texan slinks back under a rock in Crawford, Texas can not come soon enough.
The environment (i.e.
climate) of the future may or may not be conducive to human life, at least in any great numbers, but one thing that will be certain is that the change agent of the current climate change (i.e.
the current form of human civilization) will not be present in a future balanced climate.
1.
Human civilization could weather the change and adapt to changed climate with a very green technology model, at perhaps reduced numbers from what we have today.
I would of course prefer option #1, but any three will eventually rid the planet of the current change-agent in the global climate, which is the current form of human civilization (i.e.
one based on the burning of fossil fuels).
civilization starts to collpase from the disruptions caused by severe climate change?
The report states "warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice, and rising global average sea level... [and] could lead to abrupt or irreversible climate changes [search] and impacts".
Temperatures are projected to rise by 1.1 and 6.4 (2.0 and 11.5 Fahrenheit) this century.
Regarding solutions and their costs, to limit average global temperature rise to 2.0 to 2.4 degrees celsius, emissions of greenhouse gases would have to peak by 2015.
The costs of fighting warming will range from 0.06 to 0.12 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP) per year, which represents a loss of GDP by 2030 of less than 3 percent.
Regardless, global warming will last for centuries [ ark ] whatever is done.
This is a clarion call to action to save the Earth's climate.
After reading the document, I must admit I am pleasantly surprised and filled with hope given its strength, clarity and use of science to highlight the urgency of climate change policy.
Who will sufficiently respond?
Can required mitigation and adaptation be made within the framework of inter-governmental processes, or are more radical measures required?
Climate science must now translate into climate action.
Are too many of our current leaders hiding the truth of global warming as well as "poisoning the well" of public discourse?
Not only are too many leaders hiding the truth, they are also actively poisoning the well of public discourse in the process.
And for what?
Evermore power, wealth and privileges for themselves and their minions so they can carefreely play out the "conspicuous consumption fantasies" of their "Me Generation" by living long, living large and living unsustainably, come what may, having forgotten about the future of their children and about how human life depends upon Earth's limited resources and frangible ecosystem services for its very existence.
The IPCC report is much the same as the 2001.
But going back as far as 1993 a book titled 'Planetary Overload' by A.J.
McMicheal has highlighted all the problems we are seeing now including what the IPCC reported.
A. J. McMicheal has coordinated the scientific assessment of the potential health impact of climate change for the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and has assisted the British government in a similar task.
Over 14 years ago.
After years of careful and skillful research by the International Panel on Climate Change, it seems to me that the time has come to examine whether many too many government officials are behaving malevolently and acting in bad faith by continuing to disseminate disinformation about the established evidence on global warming.
With the establishment of the scientific consensus on climate change, is it reasonable and sensible to ask of government officials who remain obstructive and in denial of such overwhelming scientific data if they are perfidiously engaged in a violation of public trust and, therefore, malfeasant in office?
We can see the weird effects of climate change right here in Southeastern Pennsylvania as the trees have not lost their leaves as they usually do in mid-October.
The recent icy snow has put extra strain on tree branches b/c of it.
Just an observation.
We have billions of people around the World who do not know what Climate Change is.
That is why thinking of everyone as friends and family, and people who can help us is vital.
For we will need peace to create good communicative flow to educate and inspire those who do not yet know.
.....We can see the weird effects of climate change right here in Southeastern Pennsylvania as the trees have not lost their leaves as they usually do in mid-October.
The recent icy snow has put extra strain on tree branches b/c of it.
Just an observation.....
We had a dusting of snow today.
Weird to see all the leaves on the trees with snow coming down.
As positive as the IPCC's recent call for urgent action to prevent near-certain disaster, I believe that we have already debated and denied for too long, and a climate tipping-point has now been breached, with the potential for catastrophic global consequences.
Unfortunately, it appears to have gone unnoticed to date due to a universally-accepted oversimplification of climate modeling data.
See "www.climate-shift.info" for a brief review of info.
Technology and economy have always driven the relationship between humans and nature.
But now, with so many people, the relationship between technology and economy also holds the future of the human race and the planet.
There can be much much good — what we view as progress.
And there can be problems — terrible ones.
Much depends on the positive feedback loops.
Global warming means there will be more food grown in Canada and its thawing permafrost will release even more greenhouse gases.
But do we have to embrace a mythic vision, a conquistador’s dream of gold?
Is there some solid science involved?
Might there actually be a modern soil technolgy whereby faster growing plants would draw more CO2 out of the atmosphere and the unused plant waste turned into charcoal to be returned to the soil — resulting in increased crop yields, more carbon capture and long term sequestration, more food and fuel for increasing populations, and a new era of abundance.
In other words, might there be a positive feedback loop for healing ourselves and the earth?
A technologically and economically supported relationship for bringing human beings and nature into a mutually supportive marriage?
A sustainable relationship of abundance?
The data are not in but the soil research is being conducted and the hopes are great.
But we will need more than new agricultural technology.
Right now the overwhelming economic opportunities are located in creating fuel.
What can incentivize devoting a portion of the charcoal that can be produced from agricultural waste to amendments for renewing the soil?
Those who have no choice about polluting ways can fund those who have a choice but incur lost opportunities for short-term profits if they do the right thing.
We can leave the blame-game and help each other.
What a concept!
Uh, i think CO2 is fundamentally flawed for it's huge role in global warming with it's low output by us (.54% of global output overall).
And the icecore samples used in al gore's film confirm that CO2 increases AFTER temperature increases, not the other way around (you can't see because of the horrendous time scale).
Also, we're undeniably in a warming period, but we should focus more on other factors that are causing this rather than CO2.
Global Public Willing to Sacrifice to Save Climate, What About Our Leaders?
A new poll finds mllions of people around the world are willing to make personal sacrifices [ ark ] to help address climate change.
Ecological Internet has long noted there is little chance of addressing climate change and related global ecological crises without some degree of personal and societal sacrifice [search] .
For this we have often been ridiculed and called naive -- as many asserted there is no way the public would support this.
A new BBC poll suggests otherwise [ ark ].
They found that substantial majorities in all countries (83% overall) are ready to make personal sacrifices in their lifestyle and behavior, including paying more for their energy, to help address climate change.
And some 50% supported taxes on energy such as oil and coal -- 77% if the revenues was used to promote energy efficiency or developing cleaner fuels.
Approximately 22,000 people were polled across 21 countries.
Why are our leaders including Mr. Gore [search] not picking up on this sentiment and leading by example while asking for shared sacrifice to address climate change and achieve global ecological sustainability?
Important personal sacrifices that need to be encouraged immediately are a willingness to pay more for renewable energy, to consume less and more equitably, and to have smaller families.
Societally it is clear that clearing and burning -- that is first-time logging of ancient forests and the burning of fossil fuels that emit into the atmosphere (particularly coal) -- must end as soon as possible.
Anyone that suggests that much of the world can continue to live wasteful excessive lifestyles (while the others aspire to do so) is either dangerously misinformed or a charlatan, and regardless, doing great harm to the Earth and humanity's prospects.
Thank you Dr. Barry. So many consumers are just waiting for the goverment to set an example and make going green an easy step, not a leap.
Students in DC yesterday actually took the initiative to go down to the Hill yesterday for what they called "Power Shift 2007" and personally lobby for a bill that will do just that.
The Congress is considering an energy bill that would, if passed in its entirety, create a standard of 35 mpg in cars by 2020 and a standard that 15% of electricity come from renewable resources by 2020.
This would begin the process of weaning the USA off oil, help to stave off climate change, and quench the thirst of those millions of people that crave green.
I urge you to sign the petition at http://www.energybill2007.org in order to let our representatives know how much we are committed to the cause.
Sometimes it looks to me as if some of my brothers and sisters in the current generation of elders are so singlemindedly focused on the accumulation of wealth and power, in feathering their own gigantic nests, frequenting exclusive clubs, flying private jets, sailing yachts and visiting exotic hideaways, that they have forgotten how human life depends upon Earth’s limited resources and frangible ecosystem services for its very existence.
The “powers that be” have evidently failed to understand what it means when we say that the Earth is round, finite and has biophysical limits.
One consequence of this pernicious denial of the requirements of practical reality is that the scale and rate of per capita consumption is dissipating natural resources faster than the Earth can restore them for human benefit.
So great is per human overconsumption by a minority of people in our time that biodiversity is being extirpated and the environment degraded.
Hi, Im Clarissa Machendagoos I Live In Vermillion Bay And Go To Lillian Berg And Im Doing A Speech On Global Warming..... I Understand That Its Not Are Fault But I Really Need tips On Ho Too Stop For Global Warming...
Clarissa --- We simply must stop using fossil fuels, espeically coal, unless the carbon dioxide is safely and permanently sequestered.
As an example, “The AWAREness Campaign on the Human Population” has been in existence since 2001.
In that time, the point of all its activities has been to gain the attention of the rich, powerful and famous at the top of the global political economy.
The strategy has not accomplished much, except that someleaders now “see” the human predicament, even though they have resolutely refused to speak openly and honestly about it.
Everywhere I have gone — from the Earth Summit in Jo’burg, World Water Week Conference, “This Tiny Planet” workshop, United Nations meetings, State of the Planet Conference, Annual Meeting of the Club of Rome to local town council meetings where I managed to get a global warming resolution passed — no action is taken by anyone with power.
The people holding most of the world’s wealth and, therefore, most of the political power evidently like the world just the way it is now.
Change seems to be anathema to them.
They have made this single point crystal clear through their deafening silence, which so many of them have ubiquitously adopted as way of dealing with humanity’s distinctly human-forced predicament.
Being a young person who has given talks to hundred of teenagers in the western world on global warming, my sense is that hardly anyone wants to give up their comforts or the consumer way of life.
These recent findings surprise me, and I'd take them with a grain of salt.
ALERT: Climate Protection Payments Must Avoid Deforestation of Ancient Rainforests AND Their Industrial Diminishment
TAKE ACTION : Selective logging diminishes primary and old-growth forests' carbon stores, ecosystems, and biodiversity; and has no place in proposed carbon market payments for rainforest and climate protection
The concept of "avoided deforestation" -- whereby countries are paid to protect forests -- is the most promising rainforest and climate change policy development in years.
It fights climate change at a low cost while preserving other ecosystem services, safeguarding biodiversity and improving living standards for some of the world's poorest people.
Unlike other proposed forest conservation solutions, such as "certified" forest logging of ancient forests (primary and old-growth forests), it has the potential to maintain standing rainforests in an intact, fully functioning condition; while meeting reasonable local development needs...
For the first time a grouping of tropical rainforest rich countries, called the "Forestry Eight" and controlling over 80 percent of the world's tropical rainforests, agree and are proposing a plan to be paid to protect their rainforests and thus reduce global warming... Troublingly, many crucial details regarding how avoided deforestation payments would work remain undefined...
Let the "Forestry Eight" know that in order to ensure carbon payments for rainforest and climate protection are rigorous and maximally effective, they must be made to avoid both rainforest deforestation AND diminishment, which excludes ANY industrial development.
Only equitable payments for strict preservation will maximize climate, ecosystem, biodiversity and local benefit.
Anything less is greenwashing and will not solve anything.
TAKE ACTION :
I think this action will work, but we have to keep pushing the governments that involved in 'Forestry Eight'.
We have to make sure that those countries do the right thing for conservation and biodiversity and not just 'after' the carbon money.
Let's keep watching them.
For climateark, keep the good work.
Good luck!
Why don't you include the forest stakeholders in Canada and the US?
Our forests also sequester carbon, and deforestation is occurring here just like in the Southern Hemisphere.
Most of the scientists across the globe keep telling us that climate change is one of the biggest problems in the entire human history, and how only united world lead by developed countries has the chance to overcome this big challenge.
The leading theory of why is climate change happening today is connected with world’s industry or to be more precise with excessive use of fossil fuels such as oil and coal.
Fossil fuels when burn create harmful greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2) that end up in the atmosphere where they increase greenhouse gas effect.
The simplest solution to climate change problem would be if world would stop relying on fossil fuels to satisfy global energy demand, but in current circumstances this is really an impossible to expect.
Fossil fuels like oil and coal, are traditional fuels with long history of use which means that they have strong lobbies that support them.
This of course makes difficulties to development of the renewable energy sector.
On the other hand renewable energy sector, though promising, is still at least couple of decades away before being strong enough to compete with fossil fuels for satisfying energy demand.
There is really almost no doubt that world energetic future lies in the renewables but the real question is will climate change wait that long before showing its true scary face.
If we are to believe different climate models if nothing changes by the end of this century we (and our future generations) will see tremendous problems caused by climate change, not only in form of extreme weather events and sea level rise, but there also won’t be enough food and water to supply population on our planet, and many will die because of it.
In some parts of the world temperatures will be extreme and droughts will ruin crops (Africa), in other glaciers melting will cause serious flooding and on the long run there won’t be enough water (most of Asia).
Negative things won’t just happen in Africa and Asia, other continents will also be affected with more frequent extreme weather events such as hurricanes, sea level rise, and totally unpredictable weather that will make life extremely difficult.
If we look at it from the ethical point of view then climate change definitely looks to have the potential to judge the foundations of our civilization.
How we approach this problem will determine the true values our civilization was built upon.
Were these values all about greed and money or do they involve true moral values like caring for others and caring for the health of our planet?
What industry really represents is greed and money, basically doing anything that would bring more profits regardless of price that has to be payed to achieve that extra bit.
If we accept the fact that current climate change is really man-made phenomenon caused by excessive greenhouse gas emissions then industry must take the blame for it, and try to fix it as soon as possible in form of drastically reduced greenhouse gas emissions.
Can we expect this from the industry?
Not very likely.
You see, industry is closely connected to politics and politics is the game of giving promises to get more time so they could give even more promises.
Let us just look at the new climate deal that should be agreed later this year.
At first politicians were promising drastic CO2 cuts but the closer we are to this deal the smaller CO2 cuts are being talked about.
At the end I really wouldn’t be surprised if this new climate deal ends up like its infamous predecessor the Kyoto protocol.
World sadly still cares much more about the money than solving urgent environmental problems.
It is like there is always enough time to deal with environmental problems but all that involves finances and economy must be sorted straight away.
Take this latest financial crisis for instance.
Once mighty dollar was at stake we saw rapid actions, bunch of solutions and billions of invested dollars but when there’s talk about climate change there always seems to be more than enough time to deal with this problem.
These days many people know the answer to "why are the glaciers melting" question.
The simplest answer to this question is because of the global warming.
If we want to further explain this then we would have to say that melting of the glaciers is happening because of excessive CO2 emissions that are the result of fossil fuels burning.
Fossil fuels are currently dominant energy fuels, and fossil fuels combustion sends vast quantities of CO2 into the atmosphere, much more than oceans and forests can absorb.
Increased levels of CO2 in the atmosphere give more impact to greenhouse effect making our planet warmer in the process, and one of the most serious consequences of global warming is glaciers melting.
Lately there has been number of different studies covering rapid decline of ice cover on Arctic.
All these studies agree that Arctic is losing ice more rapidly than expected, and latest of these studies suggest how the areas of the Arctic covered in sea ice in summers will shrink by two-thirds within the next 30 years.
Scientists have calculated that area covered by summer sea ice will experience decline from about 2.8 million square miles normally to 620,000 square miles, this is about four-fifths the size of the continental U.S. According to data gathered from National Snow and Ice Data Center last year's summer minimum was 1.8 million square miles in September, which is second lowest only behind 2007 which had a minimum of 1.65 million square miles of ice cover.
Upcoming years are very likely to produce even lower data.
There is no doubt that Arctic is rapidly losing its ice, and decline in ice cover is happening even faster than scientists have predicted.
Arctic ice is reacting fast to global warming and increased temperatures, and this is trend that will have much bigger impact in years to come.
Temperatures are becoming more warmer which makes impossible conditions for ice to regrowth, and therefore Arctic is losing more and more of its ice cover.
Condition at Arctic is already alarming.
As researchers reported: "Due to the recent loss of sea ice, the 2005-2008 autumn central Arctic surface air temperatures were greater than 5 degrees Celsius (9 degrees Fahrenheit) above".
Scientists not so long ago expected such a temperature increase somewhere around 2070.
This is difference bigger than 60 years.
Does this also mean that previous calculations how Arctic will loss its ice by the end of this century were also so much wrong, and that Arctic will lose all of its ice within the next 30 years?
There is really nothing left that could surprise me anymore, and our Arctic refrigerator could soon stop working.
Arctic refrigerator is term often used to describe Arctic's refrigerator's effect on our planet because the Arctic's sea ice helps cool the planet by reflecting the sun's radiation back into space, as there would be less and less ice, the sun's warmth would instead be absorbed by the open water, contributing to warmer water and air temperatures.
This will of course give more impact to global warming.
This study was result of joint efforts by NOAA's Climate Change Program Office, the University of Washington's Institute for the Study of the Ocean and Atmosphere, and the U.S. Department of Energy.
Arctic ice cap is melting rapidly due to the global warming.
But countries instead putting serious efforts to fight against climate change and global warming are more concerned to obtain share of natural resources such as oil, gas, minerals that are now more exposed because of melting.
Countries like Russia, USA, Canada, Norway and now EU are focusing to exploit natural resources on Arctic rather than doing something that would stop current ice melting rate.
As the polar ice melts more and more new shipping lanes are opening exposing valuable natural resources.
Involved countries are interested in claiming as much territory as possible by offering different evidence that some part of the territory legally belongs to them ( Denmark for instance is gathering scientific evidence to show that the Lomonosov Ridge, a 1,240-mile underwater mountain range, is part of the Greenland, geological extension of the island that belongs to them).
It is really same old story once again.
When there's a need for serious action to save our planet from global warming and climate change all we have is lot of talk and no action, and when there is a chance of exploiting natural resources nobody waits, and action is everywhere.
Once again world has showed its greedy face, face that could cost us dearly in years to come.
Himalayan glaciers that feed seven of Asia's great rivers: the Ganga, Indus, Barahmaputra, Salween, Mekong, Yangtze and Huang Ho are melting at alarming rate because of climate change.
If this trend continues large number of these glaciers will disappear by 2035.
Himalayas are second largest concentration of glaciers in the world, just behind polar caps.
Glaciers around the world have some 70 & of world's freshwater frozen in them, which is the fact that can't be ignored so easily.
And Himalayan glaciers are retreating faster than anywhere in the world.
Given the vast number of population that depend on these rivers it is easy to see negative impact this melting will have not only in water supply in many Asian countries, but also on biodiversity, since these are extremely sensitive ecosystems.
One of the glaciers melting at the fastest rate is gigantic Gangotri glacier that supplies 70 per cent of the Ganga flow during the dry season.
Recent study carried out by the India's Department of Science and Technology has found that the Gangotri glacier is shrinking at a rate of 17 m per year because of increased impact of global warming and climate change.
Situation isn't much better with many other glaciers, for instance neighboring glacier Pindari is also melting very fast at speed of about 9.5 m per year.
And as the global warming continues strengthening its impact freshwater supply problem will also strengthen in many countries of the South Asia, which has potential to become widespread water shortage.
Ganga basin alone has population equal to whole Europe.
Water shortage will not be the sole problem, to expect are also droughts, flash floods, and landslides.
Disaster in making...
This is of course the result of increased Earth's temperature caused by global warming and higher average temperatures, and areas covered with glaciers are the most sensible ones to warmer temperatures.
Not only that this increases already high sea level, but it also destroys our natural water storage facilities.
Climate change is already showing its face and if we fail to prevent glaciers melting climate change will turn from currently serious problem into real future catastrophe.
Climate change protests are becoming more frequent in Australia and many hope that this will create enough political pressure to urge the major political parties to take action on climate change.
The politicians still fail to adequately punish big polluters, and many people believe that the time has come for politicians to step up and take responsibility because climate change needs quick action.
The public is very disappointed with false promises, constant delays, and wants to see real action in form of strict laws that would curb carbon pollution in Australia.
There were also dozens of climate change skeptics who tried to disrupt rally in some cities but they failed to do so.
The only thing they managed to do was to create minor incidents which police had to break up.
These events could be very helpful because many politicians will be forced to listen what their voters want from them, and perhaps politics will become more ignorant to powerful fossil fuel lobbies that delay major political decisions connected with climate change.
The scientists have measured that because of the increased climate change impact the temperatures in Australia had risen about 0.7 degrees Celsius (0.44 Fahrenheit) in the last 50 years.
The temperature increase is happening in every part of Australia, and this is a clear evidence of ever-growing climate change impact.
Since the temperatures are overall increasing in Australia this has lead to more frequent wildfires and drought periods, and there are also fewer cold days than compared to the past years.
Australia is one of the biggest emitter of harmful CO2 emissions, in fact Australia is the world's top per capita carbon polluter, mostly because of the fact that coal is the dominant energy source in Australia.
Australian government hasn't been able to make the necessary steps to tackle the increasing climate change impact because of the very powerful opposition, and it remains to be seen whether the election year will somewhat change the politic perspective of climate change problem.
Australia is one of the few developed countries in the world that failed to address the climate change issue even at basic level.
Since Australia looks likely to be one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change this ignorance will have to change very fast.
Australia looks to be feeling the worst of the global warming heat as according to the latest report Australia experienced its hottest decade on record from 2000 to 2009 due to global warming.
Australian Bureau of Meteorology announced that the average temperature in Australia over the past 10 years was 0.48 degrees Celsius above the 1961-1990 average which has significantly contributed to droughts and summer bushfires.
Sadly, the forecast for 2010 is even worse as meteorologists predict 2010 temperatures to be between 0.5 and 1 degrees above average, meaning that climate change is definitely continuing to play important role in Australia.
Environment Minister Peter Garrett added how "Australia is one of the hottest and driest inhabited places on earth and our environment and economy will be one of the hardest and fastest hit by climate change".
If you can remember the year 2009 in Australia (the second warmest on record) was mostly remembered by extreme bushfires, dust-storms, lingering rainfall deficiencies, areas of flooding and record-breaking heatwaves, and things could become even worse in 2010.
Despite the more than obvious climate change problem Australia still hasn't passed a carbon emissions trading scheme (ETS) aimed at reducing greenhouses gases causing global warming, mostly because opposition blocked the government's climate policy.
Perhaps this report will convince politicians that tackling climate change is really a question of national interest, and future of the whole Australia could be at stake here.
Last month there was very interesting poll conducted in Australia to check environmental attitudes, especially regarding climate change problem.
While Australians think of the global warming as the most important problem very few of them are ready to do something about it.
As in many other countries people in Australia believe that there should be some global agreement against global warming but yet fail to start their own fight on individual level.
Australia is one of the countries with constant rise in energy demand but unfortunately gets negligible amount of required energy from renewable energy sources.
Most dominant fuel in Australia is coal so it is really no surprise that Australia is among top five CO2 emitters in the world.
And with the current financial crisis it is very likely that Australia (like many other countries) will stick to coal despite its tremendous negative effect on environment, because this is the cheapest fuel.
Unfortunately Australians are not the only ones in the world with well known scheme "yes there is a problem but why should I solve it?
", this is the opinion of many other people worldwide.
People are hoping that global warming problem can be solved without their intervention, and money is definitely still more important than our environment.
Money talks but it very rarely says kind words to environment.
Despite plenty of talk about the necessity to cut down greenhouse gas emissions as some sort of global world action against global warming, this scenario is still many miles away from reality.
In fact not only that there hasn't been any significant decrease in cutting down the global greenhouse gas emissions, quite opposite there is an increase in greenhouse gas emissions in many countries around the world.
One of these countries is Australia, that is among top five greenhouse gas emitters in the world.
International research, together with the help of CSIRO carbon specialists showed that Australia's greenhouse gas emissions are still rising by about two per cent a year.
Climate change adviser Ross Garnaut has called for Australia to cut emissions by 10 per cent by 2020, based on 2000 levels, which is of course impossible with current emission levels, and would require reducing emissions by 1.5 per cent each year, which is in Australia's case very unlikely scenario.
There are some scientists who do not totally agree with this theory claiming that this calculation won't work if the balance of factors causing global warming changes significantly.
There are several different factors that will have significant effect on the amount of rainfall in years to come such as the level of solar radiation, the amount of greenhouse gases, etc.
One of the less known but still very important factors are dark aerosols that have the ability to absorb enough sunlight in the atmosphere to suppress the expected rainfall response to increased temperatures, and the immediate result of this could be less rainfall.
When discussing this rather interesting topic Dr Timothy Andrews, scientist at the University of Leeds, said that two effects should be counted together because they go in tandem: "a fast atmospheric response that is closely linked with the type of climate change mechanism, and a slower response to surface temperature change that happens regardless of the climate change mechanism.
"
According to him these slow effects do produce the predicted 2-3 per cent increase in rainfall but fast atmospheric response might change all of this, depending on factors involved (such as dark aerosols).
Climate change protests are becoming more frequent in Australia and many hope that this will create enough political pressure to urge the major political parties to take action on climate change.
The politicians still fail to adequately punish big polluters, and many people believe that the time has come for politicians to step up and take responsibility because climate change needs quick action.
The public is very disappointed with false promises, constant delays, and wants to see real action in form of strict laws that would curb carbon pollution in Australia.
There were also dozens of climate change skeptics who tried to disrupt rally in some cities but they failed to do so.
The only thing they managed to do was to create minor incidents which police had to break up.
These events could be very helpful because many politicians will be forced to listen what their voters want from them, and perhaps politics will become more ignorant to powerful fossil fuel lobbies that delay major political decisions connected with climate change.
The recent reports say that global temperatures in the first half of the year were the hottest since records began, and this is a clear indicator which shows the strengthening of climate change impact.
This however doesn't look to be giving lot of sleepless nights to politicians because global climate deal is still far, far away.
Both rich and poor countries fear that climate deal might slow down their economic development by hurting competitiveness of their domestic industries on global level.
The sad truth about our civilization is the fact that despite living in the 21st century we still haven't learned one very important thing, namely setting our priorities.
Since world leaders still cannot agree on how will new climate deal look like there is increased number of scientists who believe that we should give geoengineering a shot.
The simplest geoengineering definition would be injecting sunlight-reflecting gases (aerosols) into the upper atmosphere to counteract the effects of global warming from greenhouse gas emissions.
Can geoengineering really turn out to be a right solution for climate change?
Well, if are to believe the latest study from Kate Ricke, a climate physicist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and her colleagues then the answer is no it can't.
This group of scientists has concluded that using geoengineering to counteract climate change effect isn't connected with certain outcomes because not only could solar-radiation management lead to declines in rainfall in the long term, but geoengineering effects would also very likely vary by region, meaning that some places would likely be over-cooled by atmospheric changes that are on the other hand too small to be effective for their neighbors.
Scientists believe that geoengineering supporters do not take regional effects into consideration when discussing this topic.
According to Ricke's modelling, levels of sulphate that kept China closest to its original climate were so high that they made India cold and wet.
Those that were best for India caused China to overheat.
In other words what's good enough for my neighbor doesn't have to be also good enough for me.
Thus, Ricke and her colleagues concluded that geoengineering is at best temporary solution against climate change, even more temporary than some scientists had expected.
Rich countries are still not doing enough to tackle climate change.
From the current point of view it looks like the world leaders still hope for some kind of miracle that will drive climate change away but sadly "a miracle to save the day" doesn't look like the possible scenario.
The obvious truth is that without the strict and legally binding climate deal that would oblige countries to drastically reduce their greenhouse gas emissions very little (if anything) can be done to tackle climate change.
Politicians on the other hand do not look to be to much concerned about what is going to happen to our future climate.
I mean who cares whether our future generations will struggle to survive or not because of our mistakes when there's so many bigger questions that need to be resolved, like for instance where do we go this year on holidays?
This world is so selfish, and each person looks only for its interests, thinking only about current good times, and not thinking about the heritage we will live to our children and grandchildren.
If climate change continue to further strengthen its impact how will our future look like?
Do we really want to make a life as hard as possible for our future generations, and why in the God's name do we care so little for our planet?
Rich countries have all the power in the world but yet they are acting as if climate change is somebody else's problem.
They still fail to see that climate change is global problem that will affect all countries, and thus the petty differences between developed and developing countries are not the right reason to delay new climate deal agreement.
In the last year or so I have been increasingly frustrated with these differences between developed and developing countries that look to be the main obstacle towards the new climate deal.
Global problem like climate change requires global responsibility, and global responsibility requires more flexibility from both parties.
Many people connect climate change only with extreme weather events and increased temperatures but climate change is much bigger problem that has many different dimensions.
One of these dimensions is no doubt food supply, and according to the latest report from the Utrecht University climate change will threaten the food supply of more than 60 million people in Asia in the coming decades.
The main reason why climate change will likely have this highly negative impact on food supply in Asia is because increased temperatures will drastically reduce the discharge of snow and ice meltwater in a region of the Himalayas.
This latest study was the combination of hydrologic models, climate forecasts from five different climate scenarios, and satellite images depicting snow and ice, rainfall, and changes in the Earth's gravitational field.
In the last three decades, the Arctic ice has shrunk by about 10% a decade, which is around 28,000 square miles each year.
Polar bears are particularly vulnerable to climate change, and the loss of Arctic's ice.
Polar bears have experinced significant decline in population in the last couple of years, and some scientists estimate that if current trend continues polar bears will become extinct before the end of this century.
Due to ever-increasing climate change impact many unique Arctic habitats for flora and fauna are disappearing.
For instance we can already see tundra ecosystems being replaced by species typical of more southern locations, such as evergreen shrubs in some locations due to warmer temperatures.
Some studies have even showed that the Arctic region was getting darker and absorbing more heat in the summer because of a significant shift in plant growth from grasses and lichen to larger shrubs over the past 30 years due to warmer temperatures.
Some recent studies have confirmed that surface temperatures over much of the Arctic landscape, have jumped six to 10 degrees C above normal in recent years, especially in summer months.
One of the main reasons for this is the loss of reflective, white sea ice which causes more solar radiation to be absorbed by the dark water, heating surface layers further.
Arctic ice is not getting enough time to thicken because accelerated warming causes the surface water to get warmer, which delays the onset of freeze up in the winter and leads to a shorter period of ice growth.
In summer of 2008, for the first time in recorded history, both the north-west and north-east passages were ice-free.
The worst ice decline at Arctic was in the summer of 2007 when ice covered only 4.4m square kilometres.
Climate change and warmer temperatures are likely to increase salinity in the Baltic sea which could lead to major changes for the Baltic's sensitive ecosystems.
The researchers from the University of Gothenburg have discovered that warmer temperatures as the result of climate change will likely reduce river runoff to the Baltic sea, and increase salinity in the Baltic Sea.
Scientists fear that increased salinity is likely to have extremely negative impact on sensitive life in this area, because Baltic is a unique ecosystem that contains both marine and freshwater species.
Even the tiny changes in salinity of Baltic sea could have major impact on these sensitive ecosystems because balance between salt and freshwater is very delicate, and needs to be maintained that way.
A saltier sea will no doubt benefit certain animal and plant species while doing great damage to other plants and animals, which could upset the entire ecosystem as it will break the delicate balance of these sensitive ecosystems.
Scientists also believe that there will be major regional differences at Baltic.
Daniel Hansson, researcher at the Department of Geosciences said that "more freshwater runs off in the northern Baltic and Gulf of Finland when it's warmer, while the opposite occurs in the southern Baltic.
The reason for this is that a warmer climate leads to increased rainfall in the north and east and less rainfall in the south.
The decrease in the south is greater than the increase in the north, which means that overall the water will be saltier.
Many climate change scientists predict that 2010 will be the hottest year in recorded history.
Many people will say that this will not be the case, especially given the very cold winter in Europe and North America, but we must not forget that climate change is global phenomenon, and therefore if we look at the global data we can see that period from January to March was one of the seven warmest starts to the year on record.
The data gathered from Nasa also shows that global temperatures, averaged over the past 12 months, were the warmest for 130 years.
And the warming trend looks very likely to continue for the rest of the year.
According to Vicky Pope, head of climate change advice at the Met Office, the year 2010 has therefore more than a 50% chance of being the warmest on record.
Warming is not only connected with climate change but also with El Nino effect which has caused the ocean to release large amounts of heat into the atmosphere by making temporary shift in Pacific currents.
Some scientists like Kevin Trenberth from the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado believe that warming trend in 2010 will be more the result of El Nino phenomenon rather than climate change.
In any case both these factors will likely play a huge role if average temperatures reach roof this summer.
I say if because with climate you can never be sure, as Mother Nature tends to surprise climate change scientists from time to time.
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) definitely lost some of its authority after some mistakes, most notably the statement that Himalayan glaciers would melt by 2035, were discovered as this gave plenty of ammo to climate change sceptics and fossil fuel lobbies.
Media was very quick to react on this, and these mistakes are certainly one of the reasons why the number of climate change skeptics has somewhat increased in the last couple of months or so.
Chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Rajendra Pachauri, recently admitted this error by naming it "human failure" that shouldn't have happened.
Some media has already labeled IPCC's reports as "grey literature" describing them as something that doesn't have the necessary scientific background, and is more subject of speculation rather than actual science.
Mistakes can always happen we all know that but this was rather big mistake that has come in the totally wrong time.
Why? Because world still needs to agree on new climate deal, and any doubt about climate change will be heavily used by politicians and fossil fuel lobbies to further delay this necessary agreement.
IPCC has to make sure there are no more mistakes of such magnitude because one more mistake like this and this once very respected body can kiss its authority goodbye.
Climate change is very delicate political issue, and science needs to be conclusive, comprehensive, and of course free of speculations.
One of the richest men in the world, Bill Gates, is funding research into devices that would be able to suck up ten tonnes of seawater every second and spray it upwards which would enable the creation of white clouds to reflect the Sun’s rays away from Earth thus preventing the further warming of our planet.
This technology is called sunshielding technology, and the first trials to test this technology are already being planned.
Given that the new climate deal doesn't look very likely to be agreed in the next few years it is very realistic to expect that carbon emissions will continue to rise which means that science has to consider every possible action to tackle climate change.
When it comes to sunshielding technology then many scientists will tell you that this is probably the most benign of all geoengineering technologies (different artificial methods to cool our planet).
Last year's study has revealed the potential of sunshielding technology and according to the results of this study a fleet of 1,900 ships costing around $7 billion could stop the rise in temperature by criss-crossing the oceans and spraying seawater from tall funnels to whiten clouds which increases their reflectivity.
After world leaders failed to deliver new climate deal science must step up its efforts, and find other solutions to tackle climate change.
If currently dominant scientific predictions about climate change are true then we really have very little time to act meaning that we could be soon forced to try the unorthodox solutions like geoengineering.
I mean what other options do we have?
Waiting for miracle?
Despite the recent increase in number of climate change skeptics, the climate change is still on, especially after the latest NOAA's (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) report which showed that world's combined global land and ocean surface temperature made last month the warmest March on record.
Arctic sea ice covered an average of 5.8 million square miles during March which is 4.1 percent below the 1979-2000 average expanse, and the fifth-smallest March coverage since records began in 1979.
This was in fact the 17th consecutive March with below-average Arctic sea ice coverage.
NOAA's monthly reports have become traditional source of information about changes in global climate.
This report also has practical value as it offers farmers information about what and when to plant, it helps guiding resource managers with critical decisions about water, energy and other vital assets.
The world still hasn't matured enough when global interests are at stake, and thus we are very unlikely to see new climate deal in any time soon.
The differences in opinions between the countries, and lack of political will is making new climate deal impossible to reach, and once again the humanity has showed that our civilization isn't exactly as advanced as many think it is.
Well, at least not from ethical, environmental, and logical point of view.
The same old story over and over again.
The science says to us please stop emitting so much greenhouse gases, they present us with various reports about what is climate change doing in form of ice melting, droughts, animals disappearing, etc, and then we see some weak public support which in the end results in some false political promise about the necessity of immediate action.
Once this promise needs to be fulfilled the politics controlled by powerful oil and other fossil fuel lobbies says that we must wait for better times, and here we go again, one more time spinning in the circle.
Over and over again.
Will this circle ever be broken?
In such an atmosphere even the biggest optimists might feel the wind of change drifting the other way.
Will this wind ever change direction?
I'm the one of those who believe that only some major catastrophe caused by climate change could change the direction of this wind.
One huge disaster looks to be the only thing that could make us see through the righteous eyes, where we could be finally able to separate the right from the wrong, and remove almighty dollar from the pedestal of our civilization's values.
James Lovelock, a real legend when it comes to environmentalism, and the founder of the idea that our planet is a giant, self-regulating organism – the so-called Gaia theory, has recently given very simple explanation why humans won't stop climate change, namely because humans are too stupid.
Lovelock said that he doesn't believe how humans have yet to evolve to the point where we're clever enough to handle a complex a situation as climate change, and that only a catastrophic event of great magnitude (for instance collapse of a giant glacier in Antarctica, such as the Pine Island glacier, which would immediately push up sea level) would be able to persuade humanity to take the threat of climate change seriously enough.
It is become rather clear that another Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report won't be enough to force the world to an immediate action, especially not after the panel was heavily criticized over a mistaken claim that all Himalayan glaciers are likely to melt by 2030.
The number of climate change skeptics seems to be growing lately, and I also believe that world will fail to react to climate change before some catastrophic event of gigantic proportions.
The most worrying part in this whole story is that once climate change starts showing its scary face we'll have very limited options to do something about it.
The main problem with the adequate response to climate change is that there are so many different interests involved, especially on global level, and lets face it humanity doesn't exactly have positive experiences about solving matters on global level.
If that was the case then hunger and wars would be long forgotten by now.
Arctic sea ice has been shrinking rapidly in the last few decades, and this has lead to popular belief among many climate change scientists that Arctic region has already passed a climate tipping point, meaning that even bigger loss of sea ice is expected in years to come, and that very soon Arctic ocean could be ice-free during the summer months.
The latest study by Masayo Ogi, a scientist with the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology in Yokohama, and her colleagues does not question that climate change also played important role in Arctic sea ice loss but that there is one factor that could be even more important in explaining loss of Arctic sea ice.
That factor are Arctic winds.
Ogi and her colleagues found that changes in Arctic wind patterns, such as summertime winds that blow clockwise around the Beaufort Sea, seemed to coincide with years where sea ice loss was highest, and that the ice blown out of the region by Arctic winds can explain around one-third of the Arctic sea ice loss trend in the last 30 years.
Arctic winds could be one of the major factors responsible for the loss of Arctic sea ice in the last 30 years.
The power of these winds has increased recently, and this could explain the current trend of decline in the areal coverage of Arctic summer sea ice.
In the last 30 years, the Arctic ice has shrunk by about 10% a decade, which is around 28,000 square miles each year.
The ice reaches its minimum coverage each September, when it begins to expand as the freezing Arctic winter takes hold.
According to this study both winter and summer winds could have been responsible for blowing ice out of the Arctic in the last 30 years.
Other factors were also responsible for loss of Arctic sea ice, like increased temperatures of air and ocean.
The scientists have measured that because of the increased climate change impact the temperatures in Australia had risen about 0.7 degrees Celsius (0.44 Fahrenheit) in the last 50 years.
The temperature increase is happening in every part of Australia, and this is a clear evidence of ever-growing climate change impact.
Since the temperatures are overall increasing in Australia this has lead to more frequent wildfires and drought periods, and there are also fewer cold days than compared to the past years.
Australia is one of the biggest emitter of harmful CO2 emissions, in fact Australia is the world's top per capita carbon polluter, mostly because of the fact that coal is the dominant energy source in Australia.
Australian government hasn't been able to make the necessary steps to tackle the increasing climate change impact because of the very powerful opposition, and it remains to be seen whether the election year will somewhat change the politic perspective of climate change problem.
Australia is one of the few developed countries in the world that failed to address the climate change issue even at basic level.
Since Australia looks likely to be one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change this ignorance will have to change very fast.
Despite the recent increase in number of climate change skeptics due to some controversies about former climate change studies majority of the scientists still believe that human activity caused climate change, and that climate change impact is becoming stronger and stronger.
The UK Met Office study, after assessing 110 research papers on the climate change concluded that the climate change evidence is stronger now compared to time when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change carried out its last assessment in 2007.
According to this report our climate is changing rapidly, and mostly due to the increase in greenhouse gases that are result of human activity (fossil fuels burning).
What scientists in this study did found out is that changes in Arctic sea ice, atmospheric moisture, saltiness of parts of the Atlantic Ocean and temperature changes in the Antarctic are consistent with human influence on our climate, and all these factors point out to the global picture of warming world.
This study hasn't only looked at the regional and global temperatures but also the changes in Arctic sea ice, changes in rainfall patterns, and humidity of atmosphere.
And according to Dr Stott, one of the lead authors of this study "all these different aspects of the climate system are adding up to a picture of the effects of a human influence on our climate.
"
And yet despite so many studies that say how Earth is changing rapidly because of human caused climate change world is still not doing necessary things to halt further strengthening of the climate change impact.
The same old story again and again, lots of talk and promises, and no necessary action.
If we accept the current dominant climate change theory then climate change is already happening with the worst yet to come once temperatures increase too much.
This means that we cannot stop climate change since climate change is already here, and the only two things we can do is make sure not to increase climate change impact even further, and also to adapt to new climate conditions the best we can.
In order not to make things even worse we should significantly decrease the amount of CO2 emissions that are released in atmosphere.
Fossil fuels burning is the main reason behind excessive emissions so we should be doing everything that is in our power to replace fossil fuels with clean, renewable energy sources.
Sadly, energy demand keeps on growing, and clean energy sources are still not developed enough to provide significant share of world's total energy since they lack both tradition, as well as powerful lobbies that would support them.
If we accept the fact that climate change impact will become more powerful as the years will go by then each country must do its maximum to ensure painless adaptation to new climate change.
Rich countries shouldn't have too much problem with it but what about poor developing countries?
Dozens billions of dollar each year are needed to ensure the best possible adaptation to climate change for developing countries, and as climate conditions will become worse even more money will be needed with each new year.
Developing countries feel that the rich countries are not to be trusted since many of them have broken their promises to cut their own emissions which has created mistrust on global level that is definitely one of the main reasons that certainly played major role in undermining climate talks in Copenhagen.
However, international climate deal is still needed, because political promises are worthless without legally binding document.
Hopefully next climate talks will be able to deliver the international climate deal, so the world could actually witness that not all political promises are false.
Climate change experts agree that climate change will have very negative impact on global water supplies.
Many impact of global warming are connected with water supplies.
The list includes melting glaciers, heat waves, cyclones or water-borne diseases such as cholera, desertification, and floods.
Climate change will result in shortage of water, and shortage of water could lead to open conflicts, and even wars between some countries.
People will only see how precious water really is once there won't be enough water, and this could happen in not so far future from now.
It would be wise to count how much water we are using for certain "not so relevant" uses, for instance one study showed that it took 15,000 litres to produce a pair of blue jeans.
Such examples definitely do not help water conservation cause.
Industrial water use should be definitely put under the magnifier.
According to the latest scientific study the water vapor plays much bigger role in global warming phenomenon than previously expected, and according to the new study a 10 percent drop in water vapor ten miles above Earth's surface significantly increased the impact on global warming.
The results of this study could also explain the mystery of why temperatures have not risen as fast in the last ten years as they did in the 1980s and 1990s.
The satellite images show that water vapor was increasing in the 1980s and 1990s, and then dropping after 2000, and according to the scientists these ups and downs occurred precisely in a narrow altitude region of the stratosphere where they played the biggest possible role on climate.
Water vapor is one of the less known greenhouse gases, not as famous as its close relatives carbon dioxide, and methane but still important part of greenhouse gases family that plays crucial role in climate change.
Satellite images show that water vapor in the stratosphere decreased by about 10 percent in the last 10 years, and reasons for that are still unknown.
Though we still don't know the reason of this decrease, this was quite helpful scenario that was mainly responsible for cooling by causing surface temperatures to increase about 25 percent more slowly than they would have otherwise, with the ongoing increases in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
Scientists have also concluded that an increase in stratospheric water vapor in the 1990s likely had the opposite effect of increasing the rate of warming by about 30 percent.
Once the mystery what triggers the increase and decrease in stratospheric water vapor gets solved we will know much more about the role of water vapor in climate change.
Well if we are to believe some top climate scientists the answer could even be forever.
As some top climate scientists calculated levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases emitted from today's homes, cars and factories will continue to heat up our planet for hundreds of thousands of years.
This is contrary to belief that world should see quick recovery once we stop current levels of greenhouse gas emissions.
These results are pretty much shocking because most people believe that once we cut carbon dioxide emissions we should very soon see atmosphere that would clean itself of harmful levels in no more than one century of time.
But if we are to believe Professor David Archer of Chicago University and his associates "the climatic impacts of releasing fossil fuel carbon dioxide into the atmosphere will last longer than Stonehenge, longer than time capsules, far longer than the age of human civilization so far.
Ultimate recovery takes place on timescales of hundreds of thousands of years, a geologic longevity typically associated in public perceptions with nuclear waste.
"
Proffesor Archer believes that oceans play key role in absorbing CO2 and "the ocean is getting fed up with absorbing our CO2," he says.
The surface waters, about 100 metres deep, which used to sop up the gas quite fast, are now getting saturated with it – turning acid in the process – and so decreasing their uptake.
Oceans need to be replaced with fresh water from deep down, but this overturning circulation "takes centuries or a millennium".
And global warming is expected to slow this down: the hotter the surface layer becomes, the longer the replenishment takes.
It looks like vast amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will require eternity (from our current point of view) before being removed.
And as carbon dioxide emissions continue to rise this eternity looks longer and longer.
You can say that world's governments are under a real pressure to agree a new international treaty, that would put greenhouse gas emissions to "acceptable levels" and give us a decent chance to fight against global warming.
Hopefully they will learn from mistakes made in Kyoto protocol to actually ensure decrease in global CO2 emissions, not only on paper, but in reality as well.
This could well be our last chance to fight global warming and climate change.
Forests, especially rainforests play vital role in decreasing the impact of climate change because they absorb large quantities of CO2 from the atmosphere.
This is the reason why forests are sometimes called as "the nature's answer to global warming".
Old tropical rainforests that are absorbing the most of carbon emission are disappearing very fast because of high rates of deforestation.
Current rates of deforestation in many parts of the world are horrific and with less forests remaining less CO2 can be absorbed from the atmosphere.
Old ancient rainforests absorb most of CO2, and they should be preserved at any cost if we want to avoid the worst of climate change.
Rainforests are also home to many unique species, and areas with he richest biodiversity in the world so if we destroy them many animal species will go extinct.
Old ancient rainforests absorb large quantities of CO2 from the atmosphere which prevents further temperature increase.
The world's largest rainforest is Amazon rainforest.
Deforestation of Amazon rainforest contributes to three quarters of total Brazil's greenhouse gas emissions.
Forest funding is one of the best options to stop deforestation in developing countries and should be used much more if we want to preserve our forests and rainforests.
Deforestation on global level is responsible for about one fifth of total world's greenhouse emissions.
The more forest we lose the more CO2 remains in the atmosphere.
Though Copenhagen climate deal turned out to be one major disappointment still almost all world leaders agreed that one of the most important thing to do to tackle climate change is to save our forests, particularly rainforests that play one of the most important roles in regulating climate on our planet.
Has world finally started realizing how important our forests and rainforests really are?
Forests do not only help regulate climate by absorbing large quantities of CO2 from the atmosphere but they are also the home to millions of plants and animals, and also protect soils and watersheds from erosion.
Of course, in fight against the climate change their most wanted ability is to store carbon by absorbing greenhouse gases and preventing their release into the atmosphere.
So how can we save our forests that are so vital ally in fight against the climate change?
Currently the most popular idea is that rich countries pay developing nations to protect and manage their tropical forests in order to reduce the global carbon emissions that result from massive deforestation.
The largest rainforests in the world belong to developing countries, and without money from rich countries they will continue to destroy forests to primarily make more rooms for farms and more cattle pasture areas.
Globally deforestaion is the second main cause of global warming problem behind fossil fuels burning, and we would do great deal for tackling the climate change by halting deforestation.
The solution really looks to be simple, namely the developed countries pay for the right to emit carbon emissions, and developing nations with vast forest areas are paid to keep these forests intact.
This problem still shouldn't prevent rich countries to finance funds against deforestation.
All what these countries need to ensure is some sort of mechanisms that would ensure total transparency of these funds to ensure that money will end up in the right place.
We must not forget that by saving our forests we are also saving the future of our planet.
If an important part of these measures includes direct public spending and tax incentives to make “green” investments in areas such as public transport, energy efficiency, alternative energy supply, “smart” electricity grids, water supply, sanitation systems and pollution control, then we will be seizing the opportunity.
If on the contrary, these powerful packages promote the use of dirty and wasteful fossil energies, natural resources depletion and irresponsible consumption, then the opportunity is wasted and the future of our children is threatened.
It is fundamental to ensure that economic stimulus packages do not lock-in polluting energy technologies or dirty production and consumption, but instead promote clean alternatives.
To ensure this, the environmental impacts of all recovery measures in the stimulus packages should be assessed.
Particular caution should be observed when considering measures such as car-scrapping programmes, investments in new roads, and reducing or freezing electricity and fuel charges.
Short-term efforts to revitalise the economy must not come at a long-term cost to the environment.
We in the OECD will be closely monitoring the alignment of these stimulus measures with long-term growth objectives.
We are facing a unique chance to reform costly and environmentally damaging policies; an opportunity to improve efficiency in the use of energy and materials.
Countries will now be even more aware of the costs of policy actions, so the OECD policy recommendations for least-cost approaches to climate change and other environmental challenges are ever more relevant.
To contain costs, we should use market-based instruments; such as water pricing, greenhouse gas emissions trading with auctioned permits, taxes on pollutants, and waste charges.
These measures have the added benefit ─ in a situation where public finances are over-extended ─ of bringing in revenues which could be used to offset reductions in other taxes that create economic distortions.
A number of countries are already using the crisis as an opportunity to push through green tax reforms, often using the revenues raised to reduce taxes on labour income.
Some people fear that green taxes and emissions trading would put industry at a disadvantage with foreign competitors who may not be subject to similar costs.
However, OECD analysis has found that the effects of climate policies on competitiveness are often quite small, particularly if a sufficiently large group of countries take action.
Another key element in policy reform for a green growth is to remove environmentally harmful subsidies, especially for fossil fuel production (still prevalent in some OECD countries), consumption (especially in some emerging economies and developing countries) and for environmentally-harmful agricultural production.
It would save money for governments and taxpayers and shift the economy away from activities that pollute and over-use natural resources.
For example, new OECD analysis suggests that removing subsidies to energy consumption in a number of emerging and developing countries could drastically reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, by as much as 30% in some regions in 2050 compared to business-as-usual, and also contribute to increased economic efficiency.
Countries should also move now to assess the cost and environmental benefits of some of their environmental policies, for example some measures to support renewable energy.
Recent OECD analyses show us that support policies for biofuels production in the US, Canada and the EU can cost as much as 1000 US dollars per tonne of CO2 reduced – a very high cost for achieving emission reductions.
New green technologies can help to cut the future cost of addressing climate change and indeed many other environmental problems.
For a start, putting a price on carbon emissions and other pollutants will provide incentives and help create markets for the development and diffusion of green technologies such as solar and wind energy and carbon capture and storage.
Specific R&D policies are also needed to complement the pricing of pollution.
Public and private financing for green innovation needs to be increased.
Some governments are supporting longer-term R&D in the area of green technology as part of their economic stimulus packages.
But this is not a choice between better pricing or stimulation of technological innovation: getting the prices right will likely be one of the best triggers for such innovation.
We are organising an OECD Global Forum on Eco-Innovation (Paris, 4-5 November) to take stock of best practices in promoting green innovation.
And of course, innovation to address climate change goes much beyond R&D and new technology.
The OECD Innovation Strategy , on which I spoke yesterday, provides an in-depth perspective on how government policies can best support innovation to address global challenges, including climate change.
Our analysis clearly shows that better pricing will be one of the best triggers for the development and diffusion of greener innovation.
And, fortunately, there is now evidence that innovation in climate change mitigation technologies is accelerating.
But all these crucial leaps ─ greening our fiscal stimulus packages, reducing emissions through market mechanisms and fostering green innovation─ can only be achieved through collective action and bold political will.
The UN Climate Change Conference that will take place in Copenhagen in December 2009 will measure and reflect precisely that: our decision-makers’ political will.
In other words, it will be about vision and courage.
Climate change is no doubt the most critical of the environmental challenges world leaders are focusing on this year.
Without new policy action, global greenhouse gas emissions are expected to increase by 70% by 2050, leading to higher temperatures, droughts and storms, poor crop yields and damaged infrastructure.
Inaction can also significantly reduce economic productivity.
We’re already seeing and paying for the impacts of environmental damages.
Tackling climate change should not be delayed any further.
The economic crisis provides no room for complacency.
At the most, it might slightly reduce global emissions temporarily, after which an upward trend will resume.
Delaying action on climate change would only mean larger cuts later.
Financial and technology support for developing countries will be needed.
The success of COP15 depends very much on political will and international co-operation on an unprecedented scale to reach an ambitious but equitable agreement; an agreement that spells out who takes what actions to mitigate and adapt to climate change, and who pays for them.
The OECD Conference on the Economics of Climate Change in Paris on 18 September will discuss the latest results from our work aimed at helping countries put the post-2012 climate regime on a solid economic footing.
Partnerships between the private sector and government will also have a decisive role to play in the creation of a low-carbon economy.
The Copenhagen agreement might also give rise to new partnership mechanisms, in particular strategies to reduce emissions at the sectoral level given the even more active role that the private sector is now called upon to play in the fight against climate change.
The economic crisis cannot serve as an excuse to postpone the introduction of ambitious measures to address climate change and other environmental challenges.
On the contrary, the crisis must be seen as an unhoped for opportunity to inititate the reforms needed to step onto a path of sustainable economic development.

Address by Christiana Figueres, Executive Secretary, at the Geneva Climate Finance Dialogue 2 -3 September 2010
Russia has submitted for registration its first Joint Implementation (JI) emission reduction project under the so-called Track 2” procedure, a move that could signal a substantial increase in the number of projects under this promising Kyoto Protocol mechanism.
In a video message to the conference, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres highlighted the need for solid adaptation measures in semi-arid and arid regions that are highly vulnerable to climate change.
Such measures, she said, can also have a huge mitigation potential, and can help both to reduce threats to biodiversity and to prevent land degradation.
In a video address to the conference, Christiana Figueres stated that progress in climate change abatement is almost inconceivable without the strong involvement of business, and without significantly increased cooperation within and between the public and the private sectors.
She stressed the economic advantages for companies that increase their energy efficiency and urged business to continue driving the sustainability and green growth trend.

This is a press release from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), which is part of the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences at the University of Colorado at Boulder.
At the end of the Arctic summer, more ice cover remained this year than during the previous record-setting low years of 2007 and 2008.
However, sea ice has not recovered to previous levels.
September sea ice extent was the third lowest since the start of satellite records in 1979, and the past five years have seen the five lowest ice extents in the satellite record.
NSIDC Director and Senior Scientist Mark Serreze said, “It’s nice to see a little recovery over the past couple years, but there’s no reason to think that we’re headed back to conditions seen back in the 1970s.
We still expect to see ice-free summers sometime in the next few decades.”
The average ice extent over the month of September, a reference comparison for climate studies, was 5.36 million square kilometers (2.07 million square miles) ( Figure 1 ).
This was 1.06 million square kilometers (409,000 square miles) greater than the record low for the month in 2007, and 690,000 square kilometers (266,000 square miles) greater than the second-lowest extent in 2008.
However, ice extent was still 1.68 million square kilometers (649,000 square miles) below the 1979 to 2000 September average ( Figure 2 ).
Arctic sea ice is now declining at a rate of 11.2 percent per decade, relative to the 1979 to 2000 average ( Figure 3 ).
Sea surface temperatures in the Arctic this season remained higher than normal, but slightly lower than the past two years, according to data from Mike Steele at the University of Washington in Seattle.
The cooler conditions, which resulted largely from cloudy skies during late summer, slowed ice loss compared to the past two years ( Figure 4 ).
In addition, atmospheric patterns in August and September helped to spread out the ice pack, keeping extent higher.
Figure 2.
The updated time series plot puts this summer’s sea ice extent in context with other years.

The ice cover remained thin, leaving the ice cover vulnerable to melt in coming summers.
Scientists use satellites to measure ice age, a proxy for ice thickness.
This year, younger (less than one year old), thinner ice, which is more vulnerable to melt, accounted for 49 percent of the ice cover at the end of summer.
Second-year ice made up 32 percent, compared to 21 percent in 2007 and 9 percent in 2008 ( Figure 5 ).
Only 19 percent of the ice cover was over 2 years old, the least in the satellite record and far below the 1981-2000 average of 52 percent.
Earlier this summer, NASA researcher Ron Kwok and colleagues from the University of Washington in Seattle published satellite data showing that ice thickness declined by 0.68 meters (2.2 feet) between 2004 and 2008.
NSIDC Scientist Walt Meier said, “We've preserved a fair amount of first-year ice and second-year ice after this summer compared to the past couple of years.
If this ice remains in the Arctic through the winter, it will thicken, which gives some hope of stabilizing the ice cover over the next few years.
However, the ice is still much younger and thinner than it was in the 1980s, leaving it vulnerable to melt during the summer.”
Arctic sea ice follows an annual cycle of melting and refreezing, melting through the warm summer months and refreezing in the winter.
Sea ice reflects sunlight, keeping the Arctic region cool and moderating global climate.
While Arctic sea ice extent varies from year to year because of changeable atmospheric conditions, ice extent has shown a dramatic overall decline over the past thirty years.
During this time, ice extent has declined at a rate of 11.2 percent per decade during September (relative to the 1979 to 2000 average) ( Figure 6 ), and about 3 percent per decade in the winter months.

NSIDC Lead Scientist Ted Scambos said, “A lot of people are going to look at that graph of ice extent and think that we've turned the corner on climate change.
But the underlying conditions are still very worrisome.”

The new waste management equipment also will be able to process all recyclables together, said Solid Waste Management Director Bruce Gledhill.
Before, collectors had to separate recyclables into two different compartments - containers or fibrous paper products - to be processed on different machines.
The recycling bins for Charlotte also include new technology: Every bin comes with a radio frequency identification chip that tracks the serial number of the recycling bin and the residential address to which it is assigned.
The city says the chips will allow the city to manage cart information more efficiently and to better focus environmental education to certain neighborhoods.
Approximately 50 percent of Irish agricultural methane emissions result from farm animals, which has led to suggestions that, to help combat global warming, the numbers of cattle, sheep and goats should be capped.

The Kyoto Protocol is an international agreement linked to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
The major feature of the Kyoto Protocol is that it sets binding targets for 37 industrialized countries and the European community for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions .These amount to an average of five per cent against 1990 levels over the five-year period 2008-2012.
Recognizing that developed countries are principally responsible for the current high levels of GHG emissions in the atmosphere as a result of more than 150 years of industrial activity, the Protocol places a heavier burden on developed nations under the principle of “common but differentiated responsibilities.”
The Kyoto Protocol was adopted in Kyoto, Japan, on 11 December 1997 and entered into force on 16 February 2005.
The detailed rules for the implementation of the Protocol were adopted at COP 7 in Marrakesh in 2001, and are called the “Marrakesh Accords.”
Under the Treaty, countries must meet their targets primarily through national measures.
However, the Kyoto Protocol offers them an additional means of meeting their targets by way of three market-based mechanisms .
Registry systems track and record transactions by Parties under the mechanisms.
The UN Climate Change Secretariat, based in Bonn, Germany, keeps an international transaction log to verify that transactions are consistent with the rules of the Protocol.
The Kyoto Protocol, like the Convention, is also designed to assist countries in adapting to the adverse effects of climate change.
It facilitates the development and deployment of techniques that can help increase resilience to the impacts of climate change.
The Adaptation Fund was established to finance adaptation projects and programmes in developing countries that are Parties to the Kyoto Protocol.
The Fund is financed mainly with a share of proceeds from CDM project activities.
The Kyoto Protocol is generally seen as an important first step towards a truly global emission reduction regime that will stabilize GHG emissions, and provides the essential architecture for any future international agreement on climate change.
By the end of the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol in 2012, a new international framework needs to have been negotiated and ratified that can deliver the stringent emission reductions the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has clearly indicated are needed.

So, I think the criticism made by Avent and Krugman is a bit unfair.
It seems that all three players in the spat reach the same conclusion about the economics of climate change: that government action is necessary to provide incentives to firms to adopt energy efficiency investments.
The best government action could be cap-and-trade or a carbon tax.
I’m always surprised at the intensity of the debate among economists who basically agree over their disagreements about the minutiae of the issue.
If you are tired of all of the nonsense about the recent climate nonsense ( SuperFreakonomics , Climategate ) and want to read something reasonable about climate change economics, try the latest CBO Economic and Budget Issue Brief [ PDF ] titled “The Costs of Reducing Greenhouse-Gas Emissions.” If you aren’t into 12 pages of summary of economic models here is a summary on the CBO Director’s Blog .
Or, you can read this post for my summary of the summary.
I admit that I’m torn in my opinion about SuperFreakonomics.
I was predisposed to fully embrace it.
The first book, Freakonomics, did great things for the economics profession.
It made economics interesting and readable.
It broadened the scope of the field in the mind of the public.
Plus, Dubner is a graduate of Appalachian State University.
He came to campus, gave the opening convocation talk, I went to his public reading, met him and he sent my kids a free copy of his Belly Button book.
I’ve also contributed at the Freakonomics blog.
So, I was horrified to hear that they got the science in their climate change chapter all wrong.
Don’t be mistaken.
I don’t know if it is all wrong or not.
I’m a simple economist.
But it seems that real-life climate scientists, and not just the advocates, think that it is really, really wrong as well.
The problem, to me, is that Dubner and Levitt stepped a bit too far outside their realm of economics.
My climate policy views are closer to Krugman's than Feldstein's but, jeez, you can clarify someone's argument, point out its limitations and even discover errors without calling someone a "liar" and "intellectually dishonest".
Key U.S. CEOs and world leaders are urging the Obama Administration not to go empty-handed to the UNFCCC Conference in Copenhagen this December.
All eyes are on the president, who will address the UN on climate change in New York on September 22 while the Senate considers climate legislation back in DC.
But with the President’s focus on passing health care legislation, the climate bill awaiting action in the Senate risks being “back-burnered.”
Todd Stern, the U.S. State Department lead negotiator, has urged Congress to act.
How critical is it that the U.S. climate negotiators have a bill this year?
Would a strong bilateral China-U.S. agreement before December be sufficient instead?
In the Senate, what type of climate and energy bill has the greatest likelihood of passage, and how will it differ from the House version?
Do you agree with TEC blogger Joe Romm of climateprogress.org that there could be a “better” climate bill next year?
I've registered.
I've enjoyed the lull in the environmental economics news that health care reform has provided and I'll need an energy boost before ACES hits the Senate.
This might be it.
... Exxon worked really hard and paid consultants alot of money to make my, and many others, research agenda look like junk science.
This usually sends a chill down my back but I’ve recently realized that it was a good thing, research-wise.
With Exxon as a common enemy, funding studies that disputed CVM, journal pages were eating up papers dealing with both sides of the issue.
Who would have wanted to publish my papers without an oil spill and Exxon claiming junk science was being used to value Prince William Sound resources?

Nearly five years after Katrina and the devastating failures of the levee system, New Orleans is well on its way to getting the protection system Congress ordered: a ring of 350 miles of linked levees, flood walls, gates and pumps that surrounds the city and should defend it against the kind of flooding that in any given year has a 1 percent chance of occurring.
The scale of the nearly $15 billion project, which is not due to be completed until the beginning of next year’s hurricane season, brings to mind an earlier age when the nation built huge works like the Brooklyn Bridge, the Hoover Dam and the Interstate highway system.
According to the National Hurricane Center [ PDF ], about 1300 lives were lost as a direct result of flooding in Louisiana.
Valuing these lives at $7 million each leads to a social cost of $9.1 million.
If there is a 1% chance of another hurricane Katrina each year then the expected value of the social cost is $91 million.
While the state is still struggling with money issues, funds that had been earmarked for projects in Watauga are slowly being restored, and that is allowing the county to link the Town of Boone's Greenway Trail with the walking trail at Brookshire Park and extend the trail along the South Fork of the New River.
Planning director Joe Furman said the state was restoring a $35,000 grant from the Clean Water Management Trust Fund that had been withdrawn due to poor economic conditions.
The county is also asking the state for up to $300,000 to construct a walking route underneath the U.S. 421 bridge east of Boone.
The county commissioners took action Monday morning to move forward with that project, which will involve running a connector beneath the 421 highway bridge.
The commissioners approved an amendment to the planning grant for work on the South Fork of the New River.
After quantifying the change in adverse health impacts, the final step is to estimate the economic value of these avoided impacts.
The appropriate economic value for a change in a health effect depends on whether the health effect is viewed ex ante (before the effect has occurred) or ex post (after the effect has occurred).
Reductions in ambient concentrations of air pollution generally lower the risk of future adverse health effects by a small amount for a large population.
The appropriate economic measure is therefore ex ante Willingness to Pay (WTP) for changes in risk.
However, epidemiological studies generally provide estimates of the relative risks of a particular health effect avoided due to a reduction in air pollution.
A convenient way to use this data in a consistent framework is to convert probabilities to units of avoided statistical incidences.
This measure is calculated by dividing individual WTP for a risk reduction by the related observed change in risk.
For example, suppose a measure is able to reduce the risk of premature mortality from 2 in 10,000 to 1 in 10,000 (a reduction of 1 in 10,000).
If individual WTP for this risk reduction is $100, then the WTP for an avoided statistical premature mortality amounts to $1 million ($100/0.0001 change in risk).
Using this approach, the size of the affected population is automatically taken into account by the number of incidences predicted by epidemiological studies applied to the relevant population.
The same type of calculation can produce values for statistical incidences of other health endpoints.
BenMAP is EPA’s premier tool for estimating benefits associated with air pollution reduction strategies BenMAP estimates reductions in the incidence of a wide variety of health outcomes associated with reductions in ambient air pollution concentrations, as well as the associated avoided social costs.

... In the U.S., BenMAP is EPA’s premier tool for estimating benefits associated with air pollution reduction strategies and has been used to evaluate many of EPA’s recent major air regulations, including the Clean Air Non-Road Diesel Rule, the Clean Air Interstate Rule, and the recent National Ambient Air Quality Standards for particulate matter and ozone.

Pollution reductions would lead to improvements in visibility in national and state parks, and increased protection for sensitive ecosystems including Adirondack lakes and Appalachian streams, coastal waters and estuaries, and sugar maple forests.
including 300,000 tons per year of NOX during the ozone season.
The annual direct costs to the power sector of complying with this proposal (e.g., the cost of installing and operating advanced pollution control equipment or switching fuels) is $2.8 billion (2006 $).
Note the lack of pollution trading as a way to lower emissions.
Weathervane suggests that the transport rule will effectively kill cap-and-trade for air pollutants that cross state lines (e.g., SO2) ... I shudder at the thought.
To me, this is like enjoying smaller hot dogs for lower higher prices -- the cost of pollution reduction will be higher and, therefore, we won't be able to afford as much pollution reduction.
But still in the case of the transport rule, the hot dogs are still quite large and affordable.
Here 'tis: Green Job Creation in the Emerging Economy (I found one mistake as I reviewed them through the plenary talks (EPA air quality initiatives and NC air quality trends)).
I included a "winner" on the "loser" slide.
I beg your forgiveness).
Note that the title was given to me (i.e., I was asked to speak on this topic).
You'll notice some familiar themes in the first half:
In the second half I review a study of a local 1 megawatt solar project .
Since the breakout session is on green jobs and that is what I'm supposed to focus on, I go through an economic impact analysis (EIA).
In an EIA costs are a good thing because they generate jobs.
Then, I talk about what I think is the most important part of the study, the benefit-cost analysis (BCA).
The BCA considers the economic efficiency of the project and considers the same costs in the EIA as a bad thing.
The benefits of the project include averted costs (coal-fired electricity not paid for) and non-market benefits (the value of air quality improvements).
Using some pretest data with a convenience sample and making some conservation assumptions, the net present value of the project is about $7 million (over 30 years) and the benefit-cost ratio is about 1.5.
In other words, this is a good project.
A new peer-reviewed journal is being launched which may be of particular interest to environmental and resource economists.
The Journal of Benefit-Cost Analysis is actively encouraging manuscripts, both theoretical and applied, that are relevant for benefit-cost analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis, and related evaluation methods.
Manuscripts on resource economics, such as energy, water, and other natural resources are sought, as well as environmental topics, such as climatic change, conservation, recreation, and environmental externalities.
All levels of analysis are encouraged: local, regional, state, national, and international.
Reviews of areas of application, specific measurement issues, and shorter articles on implementable "skills of the trade" are also encouraged but queries on the latter should be sent to the editor.

There are two energy bills moving through Congress right now: The American Clean Energy and Security Act in the House of Representatives (*cosponsored by Waxman-Markey) and the Clean Energy Jobs and American Power Act in the Senate (**sponsored by Boxer-Kerry).
The meat of both energy policy proposals is a Cap and Trade program for carbon dioxide emissions — a principal greenhouse gas to which climate change is attributed — in the US.
Cap and Trade is a program for capping total carbon dioxide emission and creating a market for carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions among potential polluters.
Regulators decide the total amount of CO2 society desires (the Cap) and then allocates permits or allowances to emitters totaling that amount.
These allowances are fully marketable commodities (the Trade)***.
In aggregate, the damage estimates presented in this report for various external effects are substantial.
Just the damages from external effects the committee was able to quantify add up to more than $120 billion for the year 2005.
Although large uncertainties are associated with the committee's estimates, there is little doubt that this aggregate total substantially underestimates the damages, because it does not include many other kinds of damages that could not be quantified for reasons contained in the report, such as damages related to some pollutants, climate change, ecosystems, infrastructure and security.
Yep, you read that run-on sentence correctly--costs of climate change are not included and they still get a pretty big number.

A double dividend?
Even if a pollution tax and a quantity control (a standard, or tradable permits) were otherwise equivalent, we might perhaps prefer the tax for fiscal reasons.
Specifically, because government must raise revenues and most revenue-raising mechanisms distort economic incentives, a pollution tax might be argued to do not one but two good things: help clean-up the environment and reduce government reliance on distorting taxes.
However, economists have argued that this "double dividend" is, at least in part, a matter of wishful thinking.
The argument is that, yes, a pollution tax would restore efficiency in the polluting sector and reduce emissions, and reduce reliance on distorting taxes, but it would also introduce an inefficient excise tax on the commodity produced in the polluting process (say, electricity).
Excise taxes, too, are distorting, and it has been argued that workers facing such a tax would demand higher wages, imposing additional costs on the economy.
As policy makers around the world take action to avoid a predicted climate catastrophe, the debate is turning to the costs of reducing carbon-dioxide emissions.
Energy-efficiency measures are often pricey, and alternative energy sources are more expensive than the fossil fuels they replace.
A steep price on carbon emissions will ripple through the economy.
Does that mean a serious effort to tackle global warming is incompatible with economic growth?
Or can we make significant cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions without causing serious damage to the economy?
We put the question to a pair of experts.
Robert Stavins, a professor of business and government at Harvard University and director of Harvard's environmental economics program, says the answer to the second question is yes: Making the necessary cuts need cause little more than a blip in world-wide growth if smart policies are used.
Steven Hayward, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, says no: Energy use—and the carbon dioxide it emits—is so central to the world's economy that major cuts can't be made without significant damage.

This year’s Forum will focus its attention on climate change, growth and stability.
Considering the fact that Mr. Carstens will focus on the economic policy ingredients for growth and stability, I will concentrate my presentation on the impact of climate change, hoping that I can draw your attention towards one of the greatest challenges of our time.
If we don’t change climate change, we will not survive.
As simple and complex as that.
Indeed, I can think of no greater threat to the wellbeing of our children and grandchildren, to the lives of millions of people in poor countries and thousands of irreplaceable animal species and plants, than the unchecked consequences of climate change.
Addressing it is our generational responsibility.
Climate change is a multidimensional phenomenon.
The solution is therefore also a composite.
One of its most important dimensions is definitely about eco-nomics.
The new international agreement that we must achieve at the meeting of the COP15, to be held in Copenhagen on December 2009, will require a strong economic platform.
This is where the OECD is making its contributions, based on more than 20 years experience, working out proposals to build a sound economic and financial footing for the post-2012 architecture.
Current concentrations of green-house gas emissions have already reached 380 parts per million (ppm) of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e); exceeding the natural range of the last 650,000 years.
And if we continue with business as usual, these poisonous gases are expected to grow by over 50% by 2050.
This in turn would cause world temperatures to rise by up to 6 degrees Celsius by the end of the 21st century.
This would be equivalent to the change in temperature since the last ice age —an era in which much of Europe and North America was under more than one kilometre of ice.
Clearly, an unacceptable, unmanageable scenario.
The most difficult question is not only how much it costs to fight climate change but rather who is going to pay for it.
The distributional aspects are a key element in finding a workable solution.
OECD is more sharply focusing on this issue to propose cost effective alternatives.
The choice of policy mixes and instruments will also have different consequences for different countries.
Effective action against climate change needs participation from all countries of the world to avoid eroding its overall effectiveness (the so-called carbon leakage).
The incentives for developing countries to take part in an international climate-policy framework will depend on the allocation of roles and actions, and on the support that is provided to facilitate such actions through financing, technology and capacity development.
Therefore, while action is needed in developing countries, at least part of the costs will have to be borne elsewhere.
To move forward in addressing climate change it will be crucial to mobilise political and social support.
Thus we must produce high quality analysis, objective and reliable economic evidence and serious forecasts with credible scenarios.
And we have to communicate these findings better to convince political leaders and legislators about the need for reforms.

What is the difference between global warming and climate change?
http://www.climatecentral.org/library/faqs/what_is_the_difference_between_global_warming_and_climate_change/
Depending on who is talking, there can be an enormous difference between global warming and climate change — or no difference at all.
A lot of people, including many journalists who write about the topic, use the two terms interchangeably.
When reporters first began doing stories back in the late 1980s about how humans seemed to be doing things that result in heating up the planet, the term they usually used was global warming.
That’s because the basic effect of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide is to do exactly that.
They trap more and more of the Sun’s energy and drive the average temperature of the planet upward.
But that is only one dimension of the issue.
Average temperature is global.
Climate is local, and involves not just average temperature, but also other factors that vary, such as humidity, cloudiness, rain (or snow), how this precipitation is spread throughout the year (does it mostly come in one short burst, or over a rainy season, or evenly all year long, or something in between?).
If you live by the sea, ocean currents also make a difference.
London, England, is farther north than Montreal, Canada, for example but it has much milder winters, because the Gulf Stream carries warm water across the Atlantic to keep it relatively balmy.
Scientists have learned that raising the Earth’s temperature is very likely to change many of these factors.
So while global warming is what’s causing it, what most people are going to notice is not necessarily warming but rather a change in climate.
That sounds pretty confusing.
The bottom line is that while global warming is not wrong, climate change more accurately describes what is happening.
That is a major reason that many people have settled on the latter term.
But most of the time, whether people use global warming or climate change, they’re almost certainly talking about the same thing.
Scientists have identified no fewer than 44 essential climate variables — including not only global temperature but also clouds, precipitation, snow cover, ice cover, sea level, and even biological activity.
Many of these are measured from space, with satellites including the US/Japanese Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission, which looks at precipitation; NASA’s ICESAT Mission, which measures the extent and elevation of ice; and the U.S./French TOPEX and Jason satellites, which keep track of sea level.
Carbon Dioxide Drop And Global Cooling Caused Antarctic Glacier To Form
ScienceDaily (Feb. 27, 2009) — Global climate rapidly shifted from a relatively ice-free world to one with massive ice sheets on Antarctica about 34 million years ago.
What happened?
What changed?
A team of scientists led by Yale geologists offers a new perspective on the nature of changing climatic conditions across this greenhouse-to-icehouse transition — one that refutes earlier theories and has important implications for predicting future climate changes.
Detailed in the February 27 issue of Science, their data disproves a long-held idea that massive ice growth in the Antarctic was accompanied by little to no global temperature change.
This report shows that before the Southern Hemisphere ice expansion, high-latitude temperatures were at least 10°C (about 18˚F) warmer than previously estimated and that there was a 5˚C - 10˚C drop in surface-water temperature during the climate transition.
"Temperatures in some regions, just before the Antarctic glaciers formed, were surprisingly higher than current climate models predicted, suggesting that these models underestimate high-latitude warming under high CO
level, rather than a localized change of ocean circulation drove the climate transition.
The ice formed over Antarctica in about 100,000 years, which is an "overnight" shift in geological terms.
"Just over thirty-five million years ago, 'poof,' there was an ice sheet where there had been subtropical temperatures before," said co-author Matthew Huber of Purdue University.
Another theory refuted by this study is the notion that ice-expansion also occurred in the Northern Hemisphere during this time — a supposition poorly supported by physical evidence of glacier formation in that region, say the Yale scientists.
There are about 70 meters of vertical sea level rise represented in the ice sheets of Antarctica.
And, there are many questions regarding the glacier's stability, the temperature thresholds that would cause radical glacier melting, and the rate at which it would change, according to Pagani.
"Our findings point to the difficulty of modeling accurate temperatures under higher CO

Antarctica is in gray, with the ice sheet shown in meters of ice thickness.
The ice sheet is continental in scale, but somewhat smaller than today.
The estimate is based on prior modeling work of DeConto and Pollard and is supported by this new data study.

Hurricane Earl was far more tame than what was feared
BUXTON -- Hurricane Earl's center passed east of Cape Hatteras as the storm's gusts and driving rain have tapered off over the Outer Banks.
Hurricane warnings for North Carolina were dropped at 11 a.m., as residents and officials on the barrier islands began to assess how much damage the storm's wind and waves left.
There was minor flooding in several coastal counties, and hundreds were without power.
But the storm was far more tame than feared.
"We dodged the bullet," Gov.
Bev Perdue said this morning.
Perdue said there are initial reports of flooding in Ocracoke and Hatteras on the Outer Banks, "but a good Northeaster would have done the same thing.
"
Road crews quickly removed as much as three feet of sand covering parts of N.C. 12 on Ocraoke Island, but the biggest problem is flooding from Pamlico Sound.
“The sand on the road, in comparison to other storms, is minimal,” Baker said.
“It is mostly a water issue.
We have two to three feet of water in some locations on N.C. 12, from sound-side flooding.”
But it wasn't the hurricane that really concerned Robinson.
In Buxton, a two-story Comfort Inn had become a makeshift hurricane hostel for those who want to stay close to their homes but know they need better shelter.
Earl didn't cause many problems to the south on the Crystal Coast.
Carteret County Emergency Management officials reported only minor flooding along N.C. 12 near Cedar Island.
Flooding in that area is fairly regular during storms like Earl, said emergency services spokeswoman Kat Broome.
"There doesn't seem to be any major damage," she said.
Randy Hingson, owner of White Swan Bar-B-Q & Fried Chicken, showed up not long after 6 a.m. to start breakfast and remove the hurricane shutters from the front of his restaurant.
He closed at 2 p.m. Thursday in advance of high winds that never came.
The most likely place Earl will make landfall is on Saturday in western Nova Scotia, Canada, where it could still be a hurricane, said hurricane center deputy director Ed Rappaport.
Massachusetts Gov.
Deval Patrick urged people living in low-lying areas prone to flooding to consider leaving their homes by Friday afternoon, although no officials evacuations had been announced outside of North Carolina.
Officials on Nantucket Island, Mass., planned to set up a shelter at a high school on Friday.
"This is the strongest hurricane to threaten the Northeast and New England since Hurricane Bob in 1991," said Dennis Feltgen, a meteorologist with the National Hurricane Center.
In New York City, officials were on alert but said they expected to see only side effects of the storm - mostly rain and high winds, with possible soil erosion on the beaches and flooding along the oceanside coasts of Brooklyn and Queens.
The National Hurricane Center said Earl will keep chugging to the northeast, eventually striking western Nova Scotia, Canada, where it could still be a hurricane.
Tropical Storm Hermine gave a wet and windy punch to Texas on Tuesday before weakening into a tropical depression, leaving only minor scrapes in the storm-weary Rio Grande Valley, which is proving resilient this hurricane season after taking a third tropical system on the chin.
Hurricane warnings for North Carolina were dropped at 11 a.m., as residents and officials on the barrier islands began to assess how much damage Earl's wind and waves left.
There was minor flooding in several coastal counties, and hundreds were without power.
But the storm was far more tame than feared.
As of 8 p.m., Earl had weakened to a strong a Category 2 hurricane, and its center was located 160 miles south-southeast of Cape Hatteras.
The storm was moving north at 18 mph and had maximum sustained winds of 110 mph.
The storm had weakened since this morning and further weakening is expected tonight and Friday.

Why does the developed world worry so much about sustainability?
Because we constantly hear a litany of how the environment is in poor shape.
Natural resources are running out.
The population is growing, leaving less and less to eat.
Species are becoming extinct in vast numbers.
Forests are disappearing.
The planet's air and water are getting ever more polluted.
Human activity is, in short, defiling the earth -- and as it does so, humanity may end up killing itself.
There is, however, one problem: this litany is not supported by the evidence.
Energy and other natural resources have become more abundant, not less so.
More food is now produced per capita than at any time in the world's history.
Fewer people are starving.
Species are, it is true, becoming extinct.
But only about 0.7 percent of them are expected to disappear in the next 50 years, not the 20 percent to 50 percent that some have predicted.
Most forms of environmental pollution look as though they have either been exaggerated or are transient -- associated with the early phases of industrialization.
They are best cured not by restricting economic growth but by accelerating it.
That we in the West are so willing to believe the litany despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary results in an excessive focus on sustainability.
Nowhere is this more pronounced than in the discussion on global warming.
There is no doubt that pumping out carbon dioxide from fossil fuels has increased the global temperature.
Yet too much of the debate is fixated on reducing emissions without regard to cost.
With its agreement to the 1997 Kyoto climate treaty, Europe has set itself the goal of cutting its carbon emissions to 1990 levels by 2012.
Even with renewable sources of energy taking over, the United Nations Climate Panel still estimates a temperature increase of four degrees to five degrees Fahrenheit by the year 2100.
Such a rise is projected to have less impact in industrialized nations than in developing countries, which tend to be in warmer regions and have infrastructures less able to withstand the inevitable problems.
Despite our intuition that we need to do something drastic about global warming, economic analyses show that it will be far more expensive to cut carbon dioxide emissions radically than to pay the costs of adapting to the increased temperatures.
Moreover, all current models show that the Kyoto Protocol will have surprisingly little impact on the climate: temperature levels projected for 2100 will be postponed for all of six years.
Yet the cost of meeting the Kyoto Protocol will be $150 billion to $350 billion annually (compared to $50 billion in global annual development aid).
With global warming disproportionately affecting third world countries, we have to ask if Kyoto is the best way to help them.
The answer is no.
For the cost of Kyoto for just one year we could solve the world's biggest problem: we could provide every person in the world with clean water.
This alone would save two million lives each year and prevent 500 million people from contracting severe disease.
In fact, for the same amount Kyoto would have cost just the United States every year, the United Nations estimates that we could provide every person in the world with access to basic health, education, family planning and water and sanitation services.
Isn't this a better way of serving the world?
The United States has a unique opportunity in Johannesburg to call attention to development.
Many Europeans chastised the the Bush administration for not caring enough about sustainability, especially in its rejection of the Kyoto Protocol.
They are probably correct that the American decision was made on the basis of economic self-interest rather than out of some principled belief in world development.
But in Johannesburg the administration can recast its decision as an attempt to focus on the most important and fundamental issues on the global agenda: clean drinking water, better sanitation and health care and the fight against poverty.

ScienceDaily (Feb. 23, 2009) — In the Southern Indian Ocean, climate change is leading to stronger winds, which mix waters, bringing CO
up from the ocean depths to the surface.
This is the conclusion of researchers who have studied the latest field measurements carried out by CNRS's INSU, IPEV and IPSL.
As a result, the Southern Ocean can no longer absorb as much atmospheric CO
in the atmosphere, which is the cause of climate warming, is the result of human activity (use of fossil fuels and deforestation).
However, warming is mitigated by the oceans and by terrestrial ecosystems, which are able to absorb a large part of CO
is increasing faster in surface waters than in the atmosphere (by 2.1 microatmospheres/year in water as opposed to just 1.7 in air).
So although the CO
content in the atmosphere remains higher than that in surface waters, the difference is decreasing.
According to Metzl, who is leader of the OISO program, this increase is the result of climate change at high latitudes, which has led to an increase in the relative difference of atmospheric pressure at latitudes between 40 and 60°S, and therefore to higher wind speeds, leading in turn to increased ocean mixing, with surface waters mixing with deep waters.
Surface waters contain less CO
are carried from the deep layers to the surface and, as a result, the ocean's ability to absorb atmospheric CO
is diminished.. This is the first time that field measurements have confirmed the role of climate change in the oceanic carbon cycle in the southern hemisphere.
sink diminished by 50% between 1996 and 2005 in the North Atlantic.
The mechanism proposed by the researchers appears for the moment to be connected more to fluctuating weather conditions than to climate change.
Both in the northern and southern hemispheres, the last ten years have seen a weakening of oceanic carbon sinks, which means an increase in atmospheric CO
content and thus in climate warming.
Just how far can this go, and what will the consequences be for the future climate?
To find out, researchers will need to continue these observations and take into account these new results to validate models, especially the coupled climate/carbon models that include marine biology, like those used in the reports of the IPCC.
This is because the models currently used for climate prediction do not correctly simulate the changes in oceanic CO

Carbon dioxide and other air pollution that is collecting in the atmosphere like a thickening blanket, trapping the sun's heat and causing the planet to warm up.
Coal-burning power plants are the largest U.S. source of carbon dioxide pollution -- they produce 2.5 billion tons every year.
Automobiles, the second largest source, create nearly 1.5 billion tons of CO2 annually.
Yes.
Although local temperatures fluctuate naturally, over the past 50 years the average global temperature has increased at the fastest rate in recorded history.
And experts think the trend is accelerating: the 10 hottest years on record have all occurred since 1990.
Scientists say that unless we curb global warming emissions, average U.S. temperatures could be 3 to 9 degrees higher by the end of the century.
Global warming is already causing damage in many parts of the United States.
In 2002, Colorado, Arizona and Oregon endured their worst wildfire seasons ever.
The same year, drought created severe dust storms in Montana, Colorado and Kansas, and floods caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage in Texas, Montana and North Dakota.
Since the early 1950s, snow accumulation has declined 60 percent and winter seasons have shortened in some areas of the Cascade Range in Oregon and Washington.
Of course, the impacts of global warming are not limited to the United States.
In 2003, extreme heat waves caused more than 20,000 deaths in Europe and more than 1,500 deaths in India.
And in what scientists regard as an alarming sign of events to come, the area of the Arctic's perennial polar ice cap is declining at the rate of 9 percent per decade.
Want ideas on how to fight global warming?
Global warming doesn't create hurricanes, but it does make them stronger and more dangerous.
Because the ocean is getting warmer, tropical storms can pick up more energy and become more powerful.
So global warming could turn, say, a category 3 storm into a much more dangerous category 4 storm.
In fact, scientists have found that the destructive potential of hurricanes has greatly increased along with ocean temperature over the past 35 years.
Yes.
Global warming is a complex phenomenon, and its full-scale impacts are hard to predict far in advance.
But each year scientists learn more about how global warming is affecting the planet, and many agree that certain consequences are likely to occur if current trends continue.
Among these:
Melting glaciers, early snowmelt and severe droughts will cause more dramatic water shortages in the American West.
Rising sea levels will lead to coastal flooding on the Eastern seaboard, in Florida, and in other areas, such as the Gulf of Mexico.
Warmer sea surface temperatures will fuel more intense hurricanes in the southeastern Atlantic and Gulf coasts.
What country is the largest source of global warming pollution?
The United States.
Though Americans make up just 4 percent of the world's population, we produce 25 percent of the carbon dioxide pollution from fossil-fuel burning -- by far the largest share of any country.
In fact, the United States emits more carbon dioxide than China, India and Japan, combined.
Clearly America ought to take a leadership role in solving the problem.
And as the world's top developer of new technologies, we are well positioned to do so -- we already have the know-how.
How can we cut global warming pollution?
It's simple: By reducing pollution from vehicles and power plants.
Right away, we should put existing technologies for building cleaner cars and more modern electricity generators into widespread use.
We can increase our reliance on renewable energy sources such as wind, sun and geothermal.
And we can manufacture more efficient appliances and conserve energy.
Because, while the technologies exist, the corporate and political will to put them into widespread use does not.
Many companies in the automobile and energy industries put pressure on the White House and Congress to halt or delay new laws or regulations -- or even to stop enforcing existing rules -- that would drive such changes.
From requiring catalytic converters to improving gas mileage, car companies have fought even the smallest measure to protect public health and the environment.
If progress is to be made, the American people will have to demand it.
Do we need new laws requiring industry to cut emissions of global warming pollution?
Yes.
Voluntary reduction programs have failed to stop the growth of emissions.
Even leaders of major corporations, including companies such as DuPont, Alcoa and General Electric, agree that it's time for the federal government to create strong laws to cut global warming pollution.
Public and political support for solutions has never been stronger.
Congress is now considering fresh proposals to cap emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping pollutants from America's largest sources -- power plants, industrial facilities and transportation fuels.
Stricter efficiency requirements for electric appliances will also help reduce pollution.
One example is the 30 percent tighter standard now in place for home central air conditioners and heat pumps, a Clinton-era achievement that will prevent the emission of 51 million metric tons of carbon -- the equivalent of taking 34 million cars off the road for one year.
The new rule survived a Bush administration effort to weaken it when, in January 2004, a federal court sided with an NRDC-led coalition and reversed the administration's rollback.
Is it possible to cut power plant pollution and still have enough electricity?
Cost-effective technologies to reduce global warming pollution from cars and light trucks of all sizes are available now.
There is no reason to wait and hope that hydrogen fuel cell vehicles will solve the problem in the future.
Hybrid gas-electric engines can cut global warming pollution by one-third or more today; hybrid sedans, SUVs and trucks from several automakers are already on the market.
But automakers should be doing a lot more: They've used a legal loophole to make SUVs far less fuel efficient than they could be; the popularity of these vehicles has generated a 20 percent increase in transportation-related carbon dioxide pollution since the early 1990s.
Closing this loophole and requiring SUVs, minivans and pick-up trucks to be as efficient as cars would cut 120 million tons of carbon dioxide pollution a year by 2010.
If automakers used the technology they have right now to raise fuel economy standards for new cars and light trucks to a combined 40 m.p.g., carbon dioxide pollution would eventually drop by more than 650 million tons per year as these vehicles replaced older models.
What can I do to help fight global warming?
There are many simple steps you can take right now to cut global warming pollution.
Make conserving energy a part of your daily routine.
Each time you choose a compact fluorescent light bulb over an incandescent bulb, for example, you'll lower your energy bill and keep nearly 700 pounds of carbon dioxide out of the air over the bulb's lifetime.
By opting for a refrigerator with the Energy Star label -- indicating it uses at least 15 percent less energy than the federal requirement -- over a less energy-efficient model, you can reduce carbon dioxide pollution by nearly a ton in total.
Join NRDC in our campaign against global warming.
Politics - There is much to be discussed regarding the politics of climate change, internationally, between various stakeholders, and, of course, within countries.
Two pieces from "The Economist," for instance, illustrate the intense politics in Britain around climate change: "Climate change - A hot topic gets hotter" and the Bagehot column, "Brave Dave v Cautious Gordon.
" Both are from March 15 and both talk about the jockeying by the parties, Tory, Labour and Liberal Democrats, to be greener and to be seen by the British public as greener.
This, in my opinion, is a good battle to have waging.
To quote from the Bagehot column: "But for all Mr Blair's pioneering efforts, it is David Cameron who can claim to have done most to make climate change the topic of the moment.
It is probably fair to say that without the pressure (and the cover) that has come from Mr Cameron, the government which Mr Brown will soon lead would not be committing itself to the kind of measures called for by this week's draft bill on climate change.
" (Go here for these articles and some others but be cautioned that "The Economist" is not free.
You can get a trial subscription in order to see these.
You can also see my post of March 14 below on the British initiatives.
)
In the U.S., there are an array of political tensions: between Republicans and Democrats, of course, but within the parties as well, and between factions within other constitutencies, such as the conservative Christian community.
I will but dip my toe into these waters for the moment, by citing two recent articles.
The first is about the "conversion" of John Dingell, the exceedingly powerful former and once-again chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee in the House of Representatives.
Go here to see the committee's recent activity on climate change.
Dingell, back 20 years ago when I and many others were engaged in fighting for an acid rain title for the Clean Air Act, was a thorn, to say the least.
(George Bush, pere, it should be noted to his credit, helped break the logjam to bring forth the acid rain legislation in 1990.
) To return to Dingell, he represents a district in Detroit and he's spent his entire career being very protective indeed of the interests of the auto industry.
A recent article, though, "Changed Climate on Warming," from the "Wall St. Journal," reports that: "Rep. John Dingell once dismissed global warming as a "theory.
' Lately, the Democratic lawmaker from Michigan has had a change of heart.
"The science on this question,' he said recently, "has been settled.
'" (Sorry to say, again, that this has gone into the pay-for-the-article zone.
You can go here to access it, or get it from the library.
)
The other story that I want to flag for you concerns the very public spat between elements of the Evangelical Christian community in the U.S. One recent focus of the contention has been the very active campaign waged against global warming by Richard Cizik, the vice president for governmental affairs of the National Association of Evangelicals.
The NAE, for your information, is an umbrella group, with hundreds of organizational members, and represents on the order of 30 million Americans.
See " NAE rebuffs critics, affirming Cizik and a wider agenda " from "The Christian Century.
" (Bill McKibben is another featured writer for them.
) The NAE has an active "Creation Care" initiative.
You can hear Cizik talk about that here at NPR .
You might also check out the Evangelical Climate Initiative .
It's being led by some pretty heavy hitters out there, among them Rick Warren, Jim Wallis, Leith Anderson, and former New York City congressman Floyd Flake.
Agriculture , The U.S. Department of Energy's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, with a modest annual budget of about $1.6 billion and a staff of over 8,000 employees, is known for some pretty hotshot research.
A recent report from them, Global scale climate,crop yield relationships and the impacts of recent warming , appeared in the very highly regarded "Environmental Research Letters.
" The press release from the LLNL says: "Warming temperatures since 1981 have caused annual losses of roughly $5 billion for the major cereal crops " One of the lead authors says: "A key moving forward is how well cropping systems can adapt to a warmer world.
Investments in this area could potentially save billions of dollars and millions of lives.
" Also at the LLNL website is a link to an earlier report on how "Changes in agricultural practices could help slow global warming.
"
Economic Consequences , Since we've hit on the subject, it might be a good moment to introduce the blockbuster report, from the British government, from October 30 of last year: the " Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change .
" It lays out some stark economic prospects:
Using the results from formal economic models, the Review estimates that if we don't act, the overall costs and risks of climate change will be equivalent to losing at least 5% of global GDP each year, now and forever.
If a wider range of risks and impacts is taken into account, the estimates of damage could rise to 20% of GDP or more.
Global Ecology , Here's an arresting lead: "A new global warming study predicts that many current climate zones will vanish entirely by the year 2100, replaced by climates unknown in today's world.
" The study, discussed in this story from the University of Wisconsin-Madison (my alma mater) was funded by the National Science Foundation and is further reported by them here .
Another understated, nevertheless alarming thought, from the paper itself: "Climate is a principal influence in species distributions and ecosystem function, and the disappearance of existing climates, or the development of future climates not found at present, could have profound ecological consequences.
"
And this headline got my attention too: "Climate change: study maps those at greatest risk from cyclones and rising seas" , This story is from Science Daily and comes from the International Institute for Environment and Development .
Fun fact: 634 million people ‚ one tenth of the global population ‚ live in coastal areas that lie within just ten meters above sea level.
I went to a hugely informative event yesterday.
It focused on the "carbon markets" and was organized by the non-profit Ecosystem Marketplace .
The symposium was also geared as a promotional event for their new book: Voluntary Carbon Markets: A Business Guide to What They Are and How They Work .
What's a carbon market you ask?
Well, that's a good question.
There are quite a few dimensions to this area.
"In addition to setting emission limits, the Kyoto Protocol provides several market-based mechanisms to enable GHG emitters to achieve their assigned reductions.
The basic idea, trading emission rights, has been successfully implemented for other pollutants in many countries.
Under this system, because some countries will be able to reduce emissions more easily and cheaply than other countries (for example through forest-based carbon offset projects), they can sell their surplus reductions (or carbon credits) to countries that emit more than their limit.
This will enable achieving the overall global emissions target at the least cost.
Carbon projects can therefore generate financing for conservation by selling certified carbon credits to GHG emitters.
" (This is from the Conservation Finance Guide , a joint project of the Conservation Finance Alliance ).
Credits from Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects are a particularly hot ticket these days according to one of the experts from the symposium who works for Evolution Markets .
(See my reference to CDMs under "IPCC Report" below in Headlines .
)
One of the progenitors of the "cap-and-trade" system that allows polluters to accumulate "credits" is Environmental Defense, back when they were the Environmental Defense Fund.
The system was conceived with sulfur dioxide in mind.
Acid rain is largely a consequence of sulfur dioxide emissions from electrical and industrial power plants.
The push for this system to be deployed within the acid rain title of the Clean Air Act reauthorization was led by EDF.
See " The Cap and Trade Success Story " from Environmental Defense.
Very interestingly to me, at yesterday's symposium, Peter Koster, CEO of the European Climate Exchange , said that after Kyoto when the Europeans were looking for compliance mechanisms, they were urged by Clinton and Gore to adopt a "cap-and-trade" system because of the success of the acid rain program in the U.S. Now the Europeans are vigorously briefing members of Congress and staff, as well as legislative and executive branch leaders and staff in California, about how it all works in Europe.
See this story , for instance, from "The Hill," on some of the issues involved in crafting legislation.
See also " Four Principles for Successful Climate Policy " from Environmental Defense.
Of the four principles, one is about the cap and two are about trade.
So, you've got the "regulated" markets where requirements have been instituted on emissions and credits are traded.
But you've also got the "voluntary" markets.
In brief, according to this report from the International Institute for Environment and Development: "The voluntary market refers to entities (companies, governments, NGOs, individuals) that purchase carbon credits for purposes other than meeting regulatory targets.
" You can, for instance, offset the GHG burden of your roundtrip vacation flights.
You go to a provider who then takes the amount of money that has been calculated to offset the carbon expenditure you've made and applies it to some worthy project.
I referenced this sort of activity in my post on the " Business of Green " , see the third paragraph.
One of the folks on yesterday's panel, Josh Harris from The Climate Group, is involved in creating a " Voluntary Carbon Standard .
" (The article on the VCS is from ClimateBiz , a terrific resource.
) Here's another fun bit from yesterday: Distinctions are made in all of this between "commodity" carbon and "gourmet" (or "pretty" or "charismatic") carbon.
In other words, individuals and companies may wish to buy into projects that some may deem "prettier" (rainforest or coral reef protection, for instance) so that they feel as if they're getting more "green" for their greenbacks (or euros or yen).
Companies may tend this way because of the greenwash value or the enhancement they feel that may accrue to their corporate social responsibility (CSR) profile.
To be sure, this is a consideration that has grown enormously in importance for top corporate management and their boards.
Another worthy from yesterday's panel, Gia Schneider from Credit Suisse, pointed out that there are opportunities for companies in GHG reduction and they are finding more and more of them.
Energy efficiency and renewable energy initiatives, the most salient examples, bring costs down.
Here's a good example from the BBC: " French plan green postal service .
" What could be more obvious?!
Of course, I've been saying that sort of thing for many years.
(See my post below on Renewable Energy ).
I remember, going back many years, the visionary " Pollution Prevention Pays (3P) " program from 3M.
They say: "Over the last 30 years, the program has prevented more than 2.5 billion pounds of pollutants and saved over $1 billion based on aggregated data from the first year of each 3P project.
" The Rocky Mountain Institute , for instance, will help your business, as will hundreds of other consultants.
As RMI puts it: "Advanced techniques for resource productivity can now greatly reduce environmental impacts while providing superior goods and services at lower cost.
"
Let me note one more comment from another of yesterday's panelists, an old-timer like me, Skip Rankin from the law firm, Baker & McKenzie .
He said he'd been involved for 20 years in renewable energy projects and was pleasantly astonished to be seeing the intense level of activity that he's seeing now.
(I said in my post on Renewable Energy below that I myself felt like Rip Van Winkle with everything taking off as it is).
Skip's involved in creating contractual standards for carbon transactions.
Not incidentally, a great resource on climate change and the law is the ABA.
Their forthcoming book, Global Climate Change and U.S. Law , was edited by an old and good acquaintance - and easily one of the most prolific writers and editors I've ever known - Mike Gerrard.
(My post below on the "Business of Green" also references an informative article from the "NY Times" on the law and climate change.
)
As yesterday's symposium and one of the panelists in particular made abundantly clear: "The game is already on.
" The markets are here, and they are going to grow enormously.
Theoretically, they should greatly enhance the process of reducing greenhouse gases thereby diminishing the chances of catastrophic climate change.
World Temperatures according to the Hadley Center for Climate Prediction.
Note the steep drop over the last year.
Over the past year, anecdotal evidence for a cooling planet has exploded.
China has its coldest winter in 100 years.
Baghdad sees its first snow in all recorded history.
North America has the most snowcover in 50 years , with places like Wisconsin the highest since record-keeping began.
Record levels of Antarctic sea ice, record cold in Minnesota , Texas, Florida, Mexico, Australia , Iran, Greece , South Africa, Greenland, Argentina, Chile -- the list goes on and on.
No more than anecdotal evidence, to be sure.
But now, that evidence has been supplanted by hard scientific fact.
All four major global temperature tracking outlets (Hadley, NASA's GISS, UAH, RSS) have released updated data.
All show that over the past year, global temperatures have dropped precipitously.
Scientists quoted in a past DailyTech article link the cooling to reduced solar activity which they claim is a much larger driver of climate change than man-made greenhouse gases.
The dramatic cooling seen in just 12 months time seems to bear that out.
While the data doesn't itself disprove that carbon dioxide is acting to warm the planet, it does demonstrate clearly that more powerful factors are now cooling it.
Historically, the warm periods such as the Medieval Climate Optimum were beneficial for civilization.
Corresponding cooling events such as the Little Ice Age, though, were uniformly bad news.
Climate fluctuates.
The world isn't going to follow our preconceived ideas even if a panel of scientists says it should.
But that's what we call leaning; if we knew everything we'd have nothing to learn, and when it comes to climate we obviously have a lot.
Things like this are very interesting to read and learn about, it just isn't a surprise, especially involving climate where one would expect there to be a lot of fluctuations.
That's exactly what this is.
A climate fluctuation.
What do you mean, 'you people'?
You're turning this into an ad hominem attack.
I'm just a dad, husband and citizen who's trying to show some responsibility in a world of excess.
I can't believe there are still naysayers out there who are willing to interpret this evidence as an indication of possible global cooling.
You're an armchair scientist taking potshots at years of hard work.
True, we are dealing with a complex global system here, but to deny that pumping billions of tons of small particles into the air may not lead to global warming is insane.
The earth is not cooling; the overall trend is a warming one, and it is directly linked to human activity over the past 150 or so years (Industrial Revolution).
True, it has always changed, but it's the rate of change that is troubling.
The earth's circulatory system has been dramatically altered.
It follows that there will be inevitable adjustments to climate, to include cooling spells (see 'Duh' post).
It seems that some of you are living in a fantasy, ready to cling to the nearest theoretical life raft so you won't have to change your lifestyles.
For crying out loud, people, take a look at the poles!
Don't use this as an excuse to be complacent, take some responsibility.
Agreed, I find the whole global warming thing really disturbing.
Its like the Akira cult (from Akira).
Its like the scientists are competing with the religious nuts to convince us that "Armageddon is coming soon".
The most disturbing thing is that Governments are being coerced by a mouthy minority lobby to act and legislate against a phantom problem and their is a real anti-progress, anti-west, anti consumerism and anti-technology flavour to it all.
I would almost say that the mod's reaction is against how far we have come from more simple times and the extent to which technology has entered our lives and the puritan feeling that excess in all its forms is somehow 'wrong'?.
Global warming might well be completely unrelated to environmental pollution and to the fact that Oil and Gas (and eventually coal) are likely to run out, both utter tragedies whcih are 100% genuine.
Don't get me wrong, I feel that pollution is absolutely wrong and we need to completely reduce the amount of items we send to land-fill and recycling them where possible makes sense.
We need to urgently find replacement fuels to replace oil.
This does not imply that Global Warming is related to any of the above.
I feel that the net effect of the overstated Global Warming craze is just one where Governments and companies tax you either directly or indirectly more on anything they can.
Its already happening in the UK.
To believe that they are motivated by concern for the environment is gullible at best and kidding yourselves.
They do it for votes, and they do it to extract more money and control out of the populace.
The human condition dictates that we must be having an effect on the planet (in our minds) After all we are more than 6 billion humans in the world, and that number seems awfully big, doesn't it?
The whole CO2/warming correlation I have always considered tenuous at best and the whole idea seems entirely self-important and too far fetched to be believable...
Showing some 'responsibility' is teaching your kids not to dive in head first when Mr. Al Gore claims to have thousands of scientists (many of whom flat-out deny endorsing the 'theory'), and is proven grossly wrong on the major claims of his global warming (oops, they changed it cause that wasn't popular- "Climate Change" now) theory in a liberal country, in a liberal court.
Responsibility is teaching kids to practice what you preach- not "Al Gore's do as I say not as I do" while I spread the word on Global...sorry- Climate Change.
Responsibility is to teach them what a joke "carbon offsets" or credits are.
Responsibility is to show them what a crock it was to 'fill in the blank' on the chart when the Global Warming data didn't fit the model.
So, I'm not sure what you mean by us people "ignoring' the evidence".
Us people did not ignore the evidence- evidence that we did not have to "doctor".
" but to deny that pumping billions of tons of small particles into the air may not lead to global warming is insane"?
I don't deny that it may not lead - I go one further and say the evidence says it is NOT leading to that.
But, once the GW crowd gets stuck in a loop, they just don't let go, even when the evidence is countered- scientifically.
I don't blame you too much though, the education system has gone so liberal and if it feels good (save the earth- the new religion) do it.
It's not your fault.
And, of course, all of the new industry that was put on the fast track to come up around the bogus theory, well, if we changed now, jobs would be lost and we just can't do that.
GW/CC is just a big money grab.
What science would YOU have to see to get you off this global warming bandwagon?
Is the fact that those who came before you WROTE IT DOWN- including the ice age hoax of the 70's and now, the GW/CC crisis?
How much more plain can it get besides a picture right in front of your face?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCVQI-GI6Is uses the same logic as the argument justifying belief in god and ignores the case in point where we cannot influence climate change.
You say we are "pumping billions of tons of small particles into the air" -- I think you are confused.
Particles in the atmosphere (e.g., soot) cause cooling.
The air has gotten cleaner, and this has contributed to warming.
CO2 is a gas, and pumping billions of tons of it into the atmosphere probably causes some warming.
By how much, who really knows.
The point of the article is that while we are worrying about global warming, an ice age could come along and freeze our butts off.
It seems we have a society of worriers.
When I was growing up, we worried about global cooling.
Then there was Ebola, the bird flu, nuclear melt downs, and pesticides.
Look, on average, we are living longer, which says to me that the net effect of all human actions is good, not bad.
You say we are "pumping billions of tons of small particles into the air" -- I think you are confused.
Particles in the atmosphere (e.g., soot) cause cooling.
The air has gotten cleaner, and this has contributed to warming.
CO2 is a gas, and pumping billions of tons of it into the atmosphere probably causes some warming.
no no i think you are the one confused.
C02 even though its called a gas is still made up of "billions of tons of small particles" despite you not being able to see it it is made of particles with a mass and weight.
Soot is the incomplete combustion of carbon to gas.
the theory of global warming is that the gas particles are getting trapped in the atmosphere causing a green house effect.
Technically Carbon dioxide is a molecule.
It's made up of an atom (particle) of carbon and two oxygen atoms.
The moral of the story is that people are gullible and will believe all kinds of things rather than check facts and use common sense.
When I was in school the scientists and the media were pushing the global cooling story and jumping up and down trying to get the governments to 'do something.
' A few years later they were arguing for global warming driven by CO2 even though the science clearly showed that the earth had been warmer during the MWP and Roman Warming and common sense would expect that after a period that we called the Little Ice Age one would expect temperatures to go up.
3.
By the "poles" I assume you mean the Arctic.
Most of the Arctic melt-off of the past 150 years has been due to dirty snow caused by soot coupled with increased solar activity (see above).
Same goes for Kilimanjaro in the tropics with the added factor of loss of recharge precipitation due to deforestation lossage of arboreal microclimates.
Westerly-borne (Asian) soot has been causing more than half of the ice pack lossage in the American Rockies as well.
The rest is due largely to local soot & land use changes (deforestation) that have altered recharge precipitation patterns.
3.
The whole point of Kyoto is overall lower CO2 emissions.
Although China emits 1/3rd the per capita CO2 of say, the USA, China's emissions per unit of production are 40 PERCENT HIGHER than the WORLD AVERAGE (and even higher than the West's avg).
China's soot output (only recently discovered to cause more net atmospheric warming than surface cooling, up to HALF of what had heretofore blamed on CO2) is the highest per capita in the world.
I just want to know one thing: when a cooling trend does establish itself (this may or may not be the start of one, but one will occur) does that mean we need to pump more pollution into the atmosphere in order to keep the Earth's temp right?
"True, we are dealing with a complex global system here, but to deny that pumping billions of tons of small particles into the air may not lead to global warming is insane.
" CO2 is not composed of particles it is in fact a gas and composed of molecules .
"The earth's circulatory system has been dramatically altered.
" If you are talking about the ocean currents this is wrong.
Ditto atmospheric circulation.
"It follows that there will be inevitable adjustments to climate, to include cooling spells (see 'Duh' post).
" Adjustments?
From what "forcing"?
" For crying out loud, people, take a look at the poles!
Don't use this as an excuse to be complacent, take some responsibility.
" The south pole is gaining as much ice volume in the center as it is loosing on the coast.
It is not changing.
One method of problem solving is to wait.
Wait for conclusive proof not regression analysis or models that are tweeked untill the right answer is given.
(all the IPCC models were asked to predict the end of the last ENSO they all missed.
It ended before any prediction.
The models also missed the hurricane prediction the last 2 years.
)
Actuallly it's the height of man's hubirous to think he can predict the weather on a global scale.
In the early 70s scientists were saying global cooling and as a kid I distincly remember making a snowman in Pasadena Texas where it never snows.
The short and long of it is, looking historically, you'll find that scientists take a pinch of data, paint a big picture and hold their hands out for more grants and funds to continue research.
If you really dig you'll find that repeatedly.
Let me ask this though, how often does your local weatherman actually make an accurate prediction on the weather?
Based on whatever answer you give for that, then try and ask that same question about these experts trumpeting the global warming trend.
If reduced solar activity is cooling the planet, then all we've been granted is a reprieve.
That's not at all proof that CO2 doesn't cause the earth to retain heat.
We should take advantage of that to reduce CO2, methane, and NO2 levels in the atmosphere, so when there is a period of increased solar activity, we don't all fry.
Correct.
Ever since we emerged from the little ice age around 1850.
Studies have shown an extremely high correlation between solar activity and temperature, where as C02 lags temperature and is more of an effect than a cause.
That's not at all proof that CO2 doesn't cause the earth to retain heat.
We should take advantage of that to reduce CO2, methane, and NO2 levels in the atmosphere, so when there is a period of increased solar activity, we don't all fry.
We should take advantage of that to reduce CO2, methane, and NO2 levels in the atmosphere, so when there is a period of increased solar activity, we don't all fry.
That's the real dramatization in all this isn't it, that we're going to fry?
It's the height of man's hubirous to think can predict the weather on a local level much less a global level.
I've lived long enough o hear scientists say we're in a global cooling period to global warming and now back to a global cooling trend.
Pssst, they just want more funding and they scare you with words like we're frying because of all this.
Try digging deeper in your research say at least 50 yrs back.
Cooling does not cause glaciers, warming does.
You have to evaporate lots of water to create lots of snow to pack into lots of ice which takes lots of heat.
Somebody pointed that out a long time ago...Lord kelvin?
Erny Centigrade?
Oh and between 1961 and 1990 (actually it's more like 1940-1970), there was not a cooling.
There was a halt of global warming.
There is evidence that this was caused by aerosols.
However, it is difficult to prove with any certainty.
What is wrong with taking anything that only goes back as far as 1850 is a.
) 1850 is still considered to be part of the Little Ice age that started in 1200.
B.) It coincides with the start of an upward trend in temperature that eventually triggered the end of the Little Ice Age.
C.) Temperature in 2004-2005 only just exceeded the highest temperature at its highest just prior to the Little Ice Age.
D.) That 1000 year high has already decreased over the last 2 years and if January and February are any signs that we will see at least as significant of a drop in 08 as the increase in 04.
E.)That due to increased car usage in China the most that best case in CO2 generated by cars is level with the 04 numbers but most likely has increased.
I am really fearful of this quick fix philosophy that we as a world, and most definitely the US environmentalist groups in the US have.
The world has always seemed to be able to deal with gradual changes better then we think whether is through changing the coverage area and density of the Ozone or increased or decreased plant life.
It seems to me the earth is has always been a pendulum, always a second late on its changes but finding balance in chaos.
Our quick fix attitude seems to me that again we find ourselves more important then we are (like we could actually cause the planet to self destruct)when actually us changing to rapidly to fix one problem could cause the world the pendulum to swing faster till everything spirals out of control.
In the end taking the average of a constantly rising temperature of a world coming off an Ice Age isn't exactly the best way to judge what the perfect temperature is.
How about we wait 800 years (after the Ice Age for the length of the ice age) and then maybe we could find the "normal" temp.
Oh and the 0 Point (in the graph above and the one on the little ice age graph) is above the medieval warming period.
The 0 point on the graph isn't the normal temperature, and honestly it was probably taken to prove that 2004 was this super high number and it was only gotten worse.
My point was we had one year that spiked above the medieval high in 1200 that immediately started what is referred to as the mini ice age and since that spike we have progressively in 05 and 06 have been seeing a drop in temperature and if Jan and Feb are any sign then this year might bring us below what any increase we have seen over the last 100 years.
What I was saying about the temp part was 1850 was at a low point that started an increase in temperature that signaled the end of something we refer to as an ice age.
The flip side of the coin is that when you introduce ENZO into your argument against global cooling, global warming proponents also lose the argument that AGW affects the level of Hurricane activity.
The problem is that he who defines "normal" determines whether the current temperature is higher or lower now than it was at some particular period of the Earth's 4 billion or so years.
No one argues that since the last ice age it has been both much colder and much warmer than it is today.
Even the El Nino peak of 1998 was much colder than the temperature during the Holocene optimum.
Oh, and I didn't mention... There are two issues besides the silly debate... I have read Al Gore's book, and I looked at the numbers in it and I think that the whole global warming debate isn't exactly getting the point.
Climate change is normal.
Rapid temperature fluctuations are not.
I think we face a far greater danger from massive temperature fluctuations and the resulting weather disasters and the consequences of that.
These are my own conclusions.
I'm not repeating anything I've read.
The other problem is... who wants to breath dirty air all the time?
It's not healthy.
Have you considered the consequences of your all out assault here, masher2?
edit: The greater danger is in the near term while the earth's climate has to constantly correct itself.
Maybe we're not doing permanent damage to the earth, but we're certainly gonna get our butts kicked by Mother Nature, so to speak, if we just ignore it.
Also, another thing to consider.
It's a proven fact that polar ice caps are melting.
The freezing and melting points of water are finite.
If they melt, no "average cooling temperature" or localizing trend is going to magically make them reappear.
Do you have any science showing how they formed in the first place?
I hope anyone that would be so arrogant to claim that we won't lose them forever can furnish this kind of science before making any claims.
I think you should leave the science to the scientists, masher2.
You're comparing apples to oranges.
There aren't any studies that I know of that can provide the kind of logical leaps that you're making in your conclusions.
Gore's main points in his book have to do with rising CO2 levels.
Data that has been recorded for at least 60 years real time.
Now, 20 years of data doesn't trump 60.
Also, why was that chart even made?
Where's the context and what were they studying?
If they were studying temperature fluctuations, how do you know that it had anything to do with global warming.
You're comparing a specific observation with a theory.
The comparison isn't valid.
And the range of values until the last spike down that your whole rant is about is not even significant in regards to the totality of the data.
If anything it does more to prove warming.
If the earth is indeed warming, then, at some point, equilibrium would say that the rebound will be ever more pronounced.
The year 1816 was famous as "the year without a summer.
" That year started out, in Stanley as well as other regions of the south, so mild for the months of January and February that many folks let their fires go out and burned wood only for cooking; however, March was very cold and windy.
Showers started the Month of April but ended with snow and ice.
In May the temperature was like that of winter.
The young buds that began forming in April were stiff and frozen.
Ice, one half inch thick formed on ponds and rivers in North and South Carolina.
Corn was killed and after being planted again and again nothing was reaped from the cornfields.
June was cold, the coldest month ever experienced in this latitude.
Almost all green things as well as fruits were killed.
There was ice, frost, and some snow flurries in July.
August proved to be the worst month of all not only here but even in Europe.
September started out with two weeks of pleasant weather and the rest of the month was cold.
October and November were extremely cold and then December was mild.
This extraordinary weather condition in 1816 had been caused by the volcanic eruption of Mt.
Temboro in the Dutch East Indies, blowing 50 cubic miles of dust into the air and killing some 66,000 people.
The volcanic dust clouded the skies all over the earth causing doom and gloom and the "year without a summer.
"
I think not.
Volcanoes put more CFC's into the atmosphere every day than all of mankind has already done.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but hasn't the debate over the past few years shifted from "we're facing global warming" to "we're facing climate change"?
Because if we talk about climate change the evidence you present does not contradict it.
If places that have never gotten snow before are suddenly getting snow that is indeed climate change.
11 of the last 12 years have been the hottest 11 years on record since 1850.
One year of declining temperatures should hardly be called a trend or the start of an ice age.
Both SO2 and particulate matter have the effect of reducing global warming.
There is a correlation between increased global warming and when we began scrubbing our coal plants here in the USA.
Ooops.
This was disproven after it was discovered that GISS, the institute cited whenever someone mentions the words global warming, flubbed the data:
The term global warming was dumbed down for people who do not understand what the term means.
Seems the author of this article does not know what the term really means either.
Global warming will bring sparatic changes in day to day climate.
It does not mean that the world will get hotter.
Ever since the world started cooling off in 1998, enviros have been hedging their bets by referring to it as 'climate change'.
But man-made CO2 doesn't cause the whole planet to cool off.
It can't.
Climate Change is what's happening right now.
The sun changes a little, and the earth gets colder.
Global warming is what's not happening.
SUVs are not causing the end of civilization as we know it.
Thank you for speaking truth to power.
Golbal warming isn't a science or based on one.
It is a political movement to end the use of fossil fuels.
If climate change does not mean warming, then why do we care if we add greenhouse gasses.
And if the ice isn't going to melt, what are we worried about?
Did Tom Cruise and Scientology have anything to do with starting the Global Warming rumors??
?
What happens after this cooling period will end?
And we have a crap-load of green house gases stuck in the atmosphere?
It may just get hot rather quickly.
(Maybe!)
You know what, you are right, i mean measuring CO2 levels is no science, looking at climatic changes and their trends is in no way a science, it just meteorology and atmospheric studies.
you are right again, ice wont melt if it is heated and THEN cooled, it will stay totally solid.
And i mean extreem snowy winters and drought filled summers just mean that countries all around the world will be forced to face flooding and drought in the summer and blizzards in the winter, and what grows in these conditions?
not crops but mosquitos and other disease carrying insects.
DDT has been banned for decades because of the harmful effects it has on species like birds.
We now know that bad science was involved in the determination that it was harmful.
It actually has been found to be acceptable for use now.
Unfortunately, since a ban was placed on it, it is nearly impossible to raise the ban and begin production of it.
In Africa alone, tens of thousands of real people of all ages die because DDT can't be used to kill off the insects you mention and eliminate the diseases they spread.
Remember the big worry that "everyone" had before Climate Change/Global Warming?
The hole in the ozone layer?
Remember how we eliminated highly efficient refrigerants in order to slow the growth of the ozone hole?
We now all use more energy in everything from our homes to our cars to keep things and ourselves cool.
Oh yeah... there is no hole in the ozone layer after all.
But to come to the point, clearly a long term decreasing global temperature is not what is predicted for climate change, at least under constant solar output.
But it remains to be seen if these two conditions are verified; is it a long term trend and is it not related to change in solar output.
BTW, the second link in the story above contains statements from two prominent climate modelers, who explain how the theory of Thermohaline Circulation Shutdown was debunked.
We no longer believe GW can cause cooling in Northern Europe.
You're right, the heat is not destroyed.
And it does go somewhere, indeed.
But you seem to think that the system is frozen (sic!
), and think in terms of all other things being equal.
But the heat is constantly added and removed to/from the system, and the net balance depends on the state of the system.
If you assume one second that a major disruption occurs to the current redistributing the heat, leading to a regional cooling of large part of high and mid-latitudes (that would globally be overcome by a larger warming trend in low latitudes in the first phase, as you rightly point out), and that this cooling is enough to cover large regions with snow & ice after a while, then you have changed your forcings, more energy is reflected to space, and you may have triggered a feedback that will for a while or the long run compensate or invert the effect of increased GHG.
Now I am not saying that this is necessarily a credible scenario, and you pointed out this alternative has been dismissed as very unlikely (and the TH circulation impact would probably not change the global outcome).
It is just illustrative of the fact that the direct effect of CO2 is far from being enough to understand the warming, and that feedbacks from the system are the most important and complex part of the climate response to understand.
I think it's great how you guys stick to your convictions about global warming when the ship is going down.
Some might call it arrogant, others something worse.
I like to sit back and laugh.
Well, the concept of facing 'Climate Change' is deceptive as the climate is ALWAYS changing, therefore we are always 'facing Climate Change'.
Humans cannot stop climate change.
Even if we could the first question that would necessarily be asked is 'What is the optimal climate to change to?'.
We don't know the answer to that question and most likely never will.
What this is beginning to show, I think, is that the human contribution to the level of CO2 in the atmosphere is not the primary driver of temperature change for the planet.
If this is true then the draconian measures to reduce it will be pointless.
Holding up signs that implore politicians to 'Stop Climate Change' are nonsensical.
it went from global warming to climate change, so that no matter what event happened anywhere on the planet, it can be attributed to anthropogenic GH gas emissions.
you people want to believe that humans are destroying the planet so badly, that when slapped in the face with scientific evidence from your own sources, you change the goal posts.
whats causing it?
did you even read the article?
forces more powerful than the .003% of the atmosphere youre all obsessed with.
the sun.
it has a lower output.
temperatures go down...
Not quite.
Changes in radiance of the sun does not explain the changes in temps.
Take a look at the work of Dr. Svensmark, Danish Climate Scientist.
A good book on his theory is "The Chilling Stars".
The driver is the increased cloud cover caused by more GCR (Galactic Cosmic Rays) allowed into earth's atmosphere by low magnetic activity in the sun.
The sun's magnetic activity can shield earth from GCRs.
GCRs provide the 'specks' needed to start cloud formation, more GCRs, more clouds, less CGRs, fewer clouds.
Estimates are that a change of 2-4% in global cloud cover can foster a 1-3 deg F change in temp.
The suns magnetic activity can be tracked by observing the number of sunspots, more sunspots, higher magnetic activity.
Prior to 2006 the sun has been VERY active magnetically.
Since 2006 (the end of Solar Cycle 23) there have been virtually no sunspots and Solar Cycle 24 is a year overdue.
The result is more clouds, lower temps.
No clouds in Sahara desert may seem warmer, but remember how cold it gets there at night from the lack of clouds.
i think you have it backwards.
high clouds are made of ice, and reflect sunlight, then cooling.
lower fluffier clouds are water vapor, and absorb/warm.
Meltdown: The Predictable Distortion of Global Warming by Scientists, Politicians, and the Media
What I really liked about "Unstoppable Global Warming" is that every chapter ends with *several* pages of citations so you don't have to take the author's word for anything, you can look up everything on your own.
Compare that with the GW Alarmists who want you to accept everything they say at face value, and who also insist that the debate is over and the science is settled.
Who sounds more credible, the guy who encourages you to check his work, or the guy who wants to you accept what he has to say and discourages any questions or debate?
Alright I will correct you.
You are wrong.
You don’t get to disown the Global Warming crown of thorns.
It is yours and Al Gores forever.
You should all be made to wear signs that say “I am one of the reactionary dumb asses that believed in Global Warming”.
Every speck of reporting that supports Global Warming (now PC’ed to Climate Change) refers to a dangerous human caused warming trend.
If you choose to fantasize differently that is your business.
But there are those of us that will remind you of Kyoto and An Inconvenient Truth.
Hold it... where did I say that I believed in global warming, climate change or that nothing is happening for that matter?
All I said was that if the crisis of the day is labeled as "climate change" then citing examples of climate change is not proof one way or another.
I think we've barely been able to scratch the surface on something so complex as our climate.
But I also think that dismissing various fears out of hand is probably not a good idea.
And for those of you who think it means you're free to drive those SUVs as someone put it, I'm not sure that's a good idea either, since it leads to much more tangible effects, like pollution.
You are digging a hole that you'll never get out of.
Just because some people want to start calling global warming "climate change" doesn't mean it changes any of their beliefs.
The whole point of the global warming crowd was to say WE are to blame for temperature rises.
Just because they have started to substitute climate change for warming doesn't mean they have changed any of their science or presuppositions.
The basics of greenhouse gases NEVER mean cooling on a global scale, so to claim that WE have something to do with cooling because of carbon emissions is utter nonsense.
Some others have already pointed this out but you didn't bother to notice that.
You can't disqualify an article that is just listing facts and science showing a particular trend.
A "label" as you call it doesn't mean anything.
It is the science and hard facts that mean everything.
The global warming crowd never could get their science straight and now they are just trying to mince words to confuse people.
The sad thing is that people like you show that it is still working.
They say "climate change", and so you think any climate change is not "proof one way or another".
Don't be an idiot.
This article CLEARLY presents facts and science that don't align with anthropogenic global warming (or climate change for that matter).
It actually should be called climate destabilization.
"It actually should be called climate destabilization.
"
Not to mention, the solar trend has been opposite of what's needed to explain 20th Century warming.
And it's bottoming out, and delay in increasing is why all the deniers are now screaming "the Ice Age is coming," just because January was cold.
In the meantime, in the eastern US, we've got early migrations causing bottlenose dolphin and harbor porpoise to cross paths they normally wouldn't - causing the deaths of harbor porpoises.
Amphibians and reptiles are courting at least a month ahead of schedule ... but okay January was cold.
For a telling tale look at http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/pubs/jouzel2007/fig... . Note, that the top graph is expanded out.
If you examine this you will see global cooling and warming of the past.
Also, if you look carefully you will notice a fairly regular pattern.
In addition, you will notice that in geologic terms we are nearing the end of a warming cycle but , also note some warming trends were interrupted.
Then, go to here, http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/globalwarming/paleo... and look at that graph, as you can see we are in the warming stage.
In addition, by now you should have noticed it was much warmer in the past, and cooler.
More, then likely it has to do with solar activity.
So how does one explain all those peaks before we were emitting CO2 into the atmosphere?
I am afraid though that you will have to be arrested for increasing our dependence on mercury.
Mercury which is a known carcinogen and environmental pollutant.
Just ask the salmon, they are not happy.
And neither are the grizzly bears, which eat the salmon tainted with your mercury.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but hasn't the debate over the past few years shifted from "we're facing global warming" to "we're facing climate change"?
How about you actually turn on a TV or read a newspaper or magazine?
Most of the liberal sheep still refer to this phenomenon as 'global warming.
'
If anything, the idiots have just tossed the term 'man-made' in front of 'global warming.
'
Oh come on!
Global Warming was nothing more than a concept to market goods and to influence political change.
It has been very effective and generated a lot of money for the businesses that sell those types of goods.
Now real data is being collected that casts doubt on this well executed concept.
Now the concept has changed from GW to Climate Change (CC).
The real facts on this new concept relies on casting more fear than GW by using any natual disaster that occurs.
I'm all for having a cleaner environment and conserving energy but having it forced on me for no other REAL reason than to put money into the pockets of some "environment friendly" industry that realing could care less about mother earth is wrong.
Climate change!
Ha. The climate is always changing.
The earth is alive in a way we may never fully understand.
Let's do our best to keep her clean and utilize her gifts to their full worth.
Stop marketing products and forcing political changed based on fear tactics.
I don't understand all the hubbub regarding global warming and climate change, either warmer or cooler.
It has been occuring for the past 4 plus billion years, and will continue to do so.
Humans have no impact, neither do cattle, hummers nor anything else human made.
( i know cattle arent man made, but we do raise them in a manner that some hippies claim is not natural, whatever, they tast good, but i digress)
In 6 months some jerk off is going to create a computer model that shows CO2 can cause both warming AND cooling, and tell us that we need 6 trillion in carbon taxes to prevent 'climate oscillation'.
Milankovitch cycles are the collective effect of changes in the Earth's movements upon its climate, named after Serbian civil engineer and mathematician Milutin Milankovic.
The eccentricity, axial tilt, and precession of the Earth's orbit vary in several patterns, resulting in 100,000 year ice age cycles of the Quaternary glaciation over the last few million years.
The Earth's axis completes one full cycle of precession approximately every 26,000 years.
At the same time, the elliptical orbit rotates, more slowly, leading to a 21,000 year cycle between the seasons and the orbit.
In addition, the angle between Earth's rotational axis and the normal to the plane of its orbit changes from 21.5 degrees to 24.5 degrees and back again on a 41,000 year cycle.
Currently, this angle is 23.44 degrees and is decreasing.
The Milankovitch theory of climate change is not perfectly worked out; in particular, the largest observed response is at the 100,000 year timescale, but the forcing is apparently small at this scale, in regard to the ice ages.
Various feedbacks (from carbon dioxide, or from ice sheet dynamics) are invoked to explain this discrepancy.
Milankovitch-like theories were advanced by Joseph Adhemar, James Croll, Milutin Milankovic and others, but verification was difficult due to the absence of reliably dated evidence and doubts as to exactly which periods were important.
Not until the advent of deep-ocean cores and the seminal paper by Hays, Imbrie and Shackleton "Variations in the earths orbit: pacemaker of the ice ages" in Science, 1976, did the theory attain its present state.
Creationism was changed to Intelligent Design and so, in the new religion Global Warming became Climate Change.
And all done for the same reason: to rebrand doctrine and try to find another route to shove it down out throats.

“.. human induced global warming is a weapon of mass destruction at least as dangerous as chemical, nuclear or biological weapons that kills more people than terrorism.” ~ John Houghton Monday July 28, 2003
“.. Mr. Cizik said he had a “conversion” on climate change so profound in Oxford that he likened it to an “altar call,” when nonbelievers accept Jesus as their savior.
Mr. Cizik recently bought a Toyota Prius, a hybrid vehicle.
“ Richard Cizik is the Vice president of governmental affairs for the National Association of Evangelicals
“..Cizik dates his “conversion” to 2002, when evangelical left activist Jim Ball of the “What Would Jesus Drive” anti-SUV campaign “dragged” him to Oxford, England, for a global warming summit featuring scientist and Christian thinker John Houghton.
“I had, as John Wesley would say, a ‘warming of my heart,’ Cizik recalls.
“A conversion to a cause which I believe every Christian should be committed to.”
After his Oxford conversion, Cizik returned home, sold his gas guzzler, bought a Prius, and renewed his interest in recycling.
He notes that evangelicals comprise 40-50 percent of the “Republican base” and Republican politicians, who “have stymied action on climate change, will “have to listen” if evangelicals become as passionate as Cizik is about climate change.
Promoters of The Great Warming are hoping that other evangelicals will have dramatic conversions to the global warming cause like Cizik.
No doubt, many of these new enthusiasts for the planet are full of passionate sincerity.
But some seem to see acceptance of disastrous scenarios of global warming, fueled exclusively by human activity, as almost an article of faith, transcending need for logical argument.
For them, it has become intrinsically a struggle between noble friends of the earth and wicked allies of the fossil fuels industry.
They have adopted climate activism as a new crusade.
Evangelicals are more famous, or notorious, for preaching about the impending End Times.
At least that old kind of preaching pointed listeners towards repentance...and God.
This new mode of climate revivalism points evangelicals towards a very differently kind of imagined apocalypse, in which the solution is not divine intervention but increased government regulation, reduced standards of living, diminished national sovereignty, and enhanced powers for international bureaucracies.
That Old Time Religion now looks more appealing, because it involves God.
The court case that was brought against Al Gore and his global warming propaganda film in Great Britian, was by Stuart Dimmock - a father of two sons at state school and a school governor .
The "ruling" had to do with Al and his friends' attempt to "politically indoctrinate" little children in school - which is illegal.
I viewed the film at the parties' request..... It is now common ground that it is not simply a science film – ... – but that it is a political film.. . Its theme is not merely the fact that there is global warming,... but that urgent, and if necessary expensive and inconvenient, steps must be taken to counter it, many of which are spelt out.
"....This pack will help to give young people information and inspiration to understand and debate the issues around climate change..."
"8.
…I should say at once that it was recognised from the start that __parts of the Film contained views about public policy__ and __how we should respond__ to climate change.
The aim of distributing the film was not to promote those views, but rather to present the science of climate change in an engaging way and to promote and encourage debate on the political issues raised by that science.
"
"... in order to establish and confirm that the purpose of sending the films to schools is not so as to "influence the opinions of children" (paragraph 7 above) but so as to "stimulate children into discussing climate change and global warming in school classes" (paragraph 6 above) a Guidance Note must be incorporated into the pack, and that it is not sufficient simply to have the facility to cross-refer to it on an educational website.....
"...One particular change in the section on "Citizenship: Planning a whole day event on climate change" is of some significance:
"..... Invite in a guest speaker to go over the issues raised across the day and discuss solutions … But please remember that teaching staff must not promote any particular political response to climate change and, when such potential responses are brought to the attention of pupils, must try to ensure that pupils are offered a balanced presentation of opposing views.

Here's a NASA graph depicting solar activity over the past 400 years.
Note the high levels of sunspot activity over the past 60 years.
Also note the almost non-existent levels of solar activity between about 1650 and 1710.
This period is known as the "Little Ice Age":
Scientists based at the Institute for Astronomy in Zurich used ice cores from Greenland to construct a picture of our star's activity in the past.
They say that over the last century the number of sunspots rose at the same time that the Earth's climate became steadily warmer.
Q-Does the number of sunspots have any effect on the climate here on Earth?
A-Sunspots are slightly cooler areas on the surface of the Sun, due to the intense magnetic fields, so they radiate a little less energy than the surroundings.
However, there are usually nearby areas associated with the sunspots that are a little hotter (called falculae), and they more than compensate.
The result is that there is a little bit more radiation coming from the Sun when it has more sunspots, but the effect is so small that it has very little impact on the weather and climate on Earth.
However, there are more important indirect effects: sunspots are associated with what we call "active regions", with large magnetic structures containing very hot material (being held in place by the magnetism).
This causes more ultraviolet (or UV) radiation (the rays that give you a suntan or sunburn), and extreme ultraviolet radiation (EUV).
These types of radiation have an impact on the chemistry of the upper atmosphere (e.g.
producing ozone).
Since some of these products act as greenhouse gases, the number of sunspots (through association with active regions) may influence the climate in this way.
These ejections drag with them some of the more intense magnetic fields that are found in the active regions.
The magnetic fields act as a shield for high-energy particles coming from various sources in our galaxy (outside the solar system).
These "cosmic rays" (CRs) cause ionization of molecules in the atmosphere, and thereby can cause clouds to form (because the ionized molecules or dust particle can act as "seeds" for drop formation).
If clouds are formed very high in the atmosphere, the net result is a heating of the Earth - it acts as a "blanket" that keeps warmth in.
If clouds are formed lower down in the atmosphere, they reflect sunlight better than they keep heat inside, so the net result is cooling.
[note: the idea is that increased solar activity keeps away galactic cosmic rays from Earth's atmosphere.
GCRs are believed to contribute to the formation of low-level cumulus clouds.
These thick low-lying cumulus clouds BLOCK sunlight and act to COOL the planet.
So when solar activity is highest, LESS GCRs get through to form the sunlight-blocking clouds, more direct sunlight reaches the Earth's surface AND the planet warms...naturally.-LC]
"'A systematic change in global cloud cover will change the atmospheric heating profile,'...'In other words, the cosmic ray-induced global cloud changes could be the long-sought mechanism connecting solar and climate variability.
' ..."
2) The IPCC report had to be "amended" over and over again.
The hockey stick graph has been eliminated, owing to the fact that it was discredited about as soon as it came out.
In the beginning there was a statement in the IPCC that there was NO evidence that man was impacting climate change.
This was removed as it did not fit their agenda.
Several scientists left the panel when they saw the inaccuracies and exaggerations in the report.
At least one scientist sued to have his name removed.
4) The models they used do not take in to consideration such things as solar activity, precipitation and cloud cover.
The models themselves are not worthy of any consideration with out those three elements.
Think about it, the three elements that OBVIOUSLY influence the temperature the most aren't even addressed.
5) Thus, this report is so fundamentally flawed that any true (non government funded) scientist would disregard it.
This report is based loosely on "correlation" only.
Correlation does not mean causation!
There was just an article published that owing to the fact that there are fewer pirates there is global warming, same correlation.
6) AGW doesn’t even pass the most basic “smell test”.
CO2 makes up .004% of the atmosphere, there in NO way this extremely small percentage, even if doubled, could impact the temperature as they are inclined to say it “does”.
9) Its called WEATHER.
It gets warmer and cooler; the poles have even been known to switch with each other.
There have been ice ages, warm periods, and it will continue to be that way.
This is the most inane crap that man has ever contrived!
I agree that we all need to be better stewards of the environment, but this is not the way to do it.
I was around in the 70s when the next ice age was coming, as I am a climber I couldn't wait...oh well.
Maybe now I can get my wish, better get back in shape.
3) There are more than 600 climate scientists in the IPCC WGII alone.
The fact it appears more than a dozen scientists had to ask to have their names removed from the 400 added to the fact only a handful have any climate-related experience at, makes the list of 400 a useless claim of authority.
6) How much radiation does 02 absorb?
Zero! N2?
Zero! That leaves only one percent of atmospheric gases responsible for 100 percent of the radiative forcing.
Of the remaining gases Argon is .93 of that 1 percent and again no to little absorption.
The next two, CO2 and CH4 are .06 of the remaining .07 and are responsible for 99.9 percent of radiative forcing.
But, contrary to the deniers, warmers, and even skeptics such as me, accept that CO2 is a greenhouse gas, and that the qualities that make it a greenhouse gas are the same ones which can cause it to cause temps to increase.
We also recognize, contrary to the deniers, that there isn't just a single factor which causes climate variations, that it is indeed a whole lot more than just the sun.
You need to examine the concept of isotopes and atmospheric CO2.
Say, I just went to check the data, since the source for the claims is a global warming denier, and well, I decided to check GISS first.
Guess what I found.
I'm never one to jump to conclusions so I'm neither on the "global warming is happening" bandwagon or the "global warming isn't happening" bandwagon.
It will be interesting to see more data as it comes in though and if this is a fluke on an upward trend or the beginning of a long downward trend.
are incorrect.
Not even mentioning the now erased statement about " eras[ing] nearly all the global warming recorded over the past 100 years ".
Apparently M. Asher failed to realize that the zero on the graph is not the level 100 years ago, but the average over a reference period post WWII (that varies with climate centers, but in no way goes back to 1900 or 1908 for what matters).
The delta in T from the last 100 years (based on the month of Jan only, so comparing Jan 1908 to Jan 2008)is +0.53degC (GISS) or 0.516 degC (Hadley).
The delta in T from averaged over 1908 and 2007 (excluding Jan 2008 only, but accounting for the decrease in the previous months) is 0.91 degC (GISS & Hadley).
Now to stick to Masher's word, delta T over the last 12 months (Feb 2007-> Jan 08) and corresponding 12 months 100 years ago (Feb 1907 -> Jan 1908) is +0.86degC (Hadley).
I don't know if you read the parent, but he was stating that this article was "uncritically repeating lies" when in fact this is data reported from 4 different climate-based organizations.
He then used the GIS 2007 report to "debunk" this particular data point altogether, but as I pointed out, the GIS data does not have any pertinent data to come to that conclusion.
If you want to debate that this is a short time period and could be a fluke I fully respect that.
However this is a huge jump in a short period of time.
Something that probably shouldn't happen if global climate change was attributed only to human activity (as CO2 levels have been very comparable in the past decade - slight upward trend)
This is not rocket science people.
Melt an ice cube in warm water and the temperature of the water drops dramatically.
The ice caps melted and so the planet is enjoying a temporary drop in mean temperature.
It won't be permanent and when the planet stabilizes it will cook without it's natural air conditioners the cool it.
I think that effect is supposed to be limited to polar regions though.
Not sure it could explain a global trend.
Any reference on that?

Obviously.
Honestly DT, it's like you don't understand basic science anymore.
If it's getting warmer, it's catastrophic anthropogenic global warming due to manmade CO2.
If it's getting cooler, it's climate change due to catastrophic anthropogenic global warming due to manmade CO2.
If it's getting cooler quickly, it's climate change due to catastrophic anthropogenic global warming due to manmade CO2, and we're about to enter a new ice age in which the polar ice caps melt, cover the whole earth, and then refreeze.
And if heaven forbid the temperature stays the same, RUN!

Yeah but does water level rise in that glass once the ice is melted??
That is the million dollar question that Al Gore wont answer.
Answer is NO.
Same result if the entire north polar ice cap melted.
Oceans rise 0.0mm.
On to a more logical disection of your argument, which is made by all global warming zealots.
They think the earth's climate is a closed system that follows the laws of thermodynamics, but only in a chaos-theory sorta way.
"If you fart in Quangzhou a waterspout forms off of Key Largo.
" If the ice caps melt, we cool off temporarily.
Come on... The thermohaline cycle of the oceans move at a snails-pace.
Plus, last I checked, cold water sinks due to higher density.
So it would cool the bottom of the oceans from 34.4 degrees to, say, 34.4 degrees.
To disagree with you on a final point, this IS JUST AS COMPLEX as Rocket Science and to dimish it to something less is just an emotional plea.
You cannot boil your half-witted, Algorian canon into an ice cube in water argument and expect us to agree that the sky is falling.
It seems that you missed the point of sea level rise by GW in general and the component induced by ice melt.
If the polar ice caps melting (though they are now re-freezing to levels higher than before) results in a rise in sea level, then why is Venice, Italy, showing record low water levels?
Try a simple experiment.
Take a glass.
Fill it with ice cubes and then add water up to the brim of the glass.
Allow the ice to melt (hell, even cover the glass if you would like to in order to limit evaporation).
What will happen??
The water will not overflow the glass.
Ever. In fact the water level will lower slightly.
Why? Because water expands when it freezes and the ice displaces water.
When the ice melts, the displacement eventually stops and the water level lowers slightly.
Not all polar ice is floating in the ocean.
A majority of it is on land.
The majority of such ice is indeed in the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets.
Unlocking all the water in those sheets would have a catastrophic effect on world sea levels.
However, sea-level is rising only 2-3mm/year (~25cm/century), the same rate its been rising for thousands of years, ever since we exited the last Ice Age.
Southern Hemisphere ice appears to be growing at present, and Greenland ice shrinking very slowly.
The pole that has the melting ice (North) is entirely over water.
The North Pole has zero land underneath it.
Wrong, they aren't counting artic sea ice when they are measure glacier melt.
They're counting ice (glaciers) primarily on the continent of Antartica and on Greenland.
Right, so the ice melts causing the mean temperature of this theoretical glass of water to drop ... enough for it to freeze again?
Quite right: Duh.
As a species, we must learn to adapt to climate change.
Trying to stop climate change is not only futile, but will result in bankrupting our economy.
Only rich, successful societies will be able to adapt.
Therefore it is illogical to spend our resources trying to prevent the inevitable, and much better to spend them doing the things we need to survive as a species.
One of the biggest challenges will be to manage and move large quantities of water.
We will need to learn to desalinate cost-efficiently, and to be able transport water to areas that need it.
Agreed- the climate is cyclic, deal with it- don't try to play mother nature because you will lose to… mother nature.
Let’s address more pressing problems like Genocide- dependency on foreign energies, and help countries and people become self sufficient.
I have no problem exploring new sources of energy and cleaner fuel- but don’t feed me any “it will help global warming” garbage, because then a person comes across as uniformed and going with the crowd of fear mongers.
We dont understand what is completely happening other than that the climate is getting hotter and we are contributing to it.
Global Warming will result in larger changes than simply water shortages, so having Perrier delivered to your door wont handle other issues.
How will the plants and animals adapt to the change?
What will this do to our food source?
Does Global Warming contribute to more often and greater intensity storms and water damage?
How will we resolve this.
Will microorganisms thrive with the Global Warming changes?
Is there an increased danger to a massive epademic with the stresses to the plant and animal life to the changing climate?
Case in point - scientific studies found that aerosol was contributing to the ozone layer depletion.
Many years followed of people saying it was junk science.
Finally things got so bad that is was quite evident that the ozone layer was being damaged and the evidence strongly pointed to aerosol.
So governments around the world started to ban aerosol.
The US finally saw the light and stepped in line.
We can now see that the layer is repairing itself many years after the ban.
It will take some time for it to fully repair itself.
Outstanding revisionist history, well done!
Maybe the fact that the US was one of the FIRST countries to start banning aerosols, one of the original 28 signers of the Vienna Convention, etc.
all missed your attention.
The effect was first hypothesized in 1973 and confirmed in 1976, followed by a series of studies to determine it's actual atmospheric effect (including studies on determining how it could reach the upper atmosphere to have an effect).
It took about 5 years for the data sets to be collected and clear, and another 3 years until the Vienna Convention.
But don't let little things like facts get in the way of your obviously well-informed opinions.
If you're suggesting that the 'ozone layer depletion' did not have its opponents in the scientific community, you obviously are the revisionist, or at least have severe memory issues.
On January 23, 1978, Sweden became the first nation to ban CFC-containing aerosol sprays that are thought to damage the ozone layer.
A few other countries, including the United States, Canada, and Norway, followed suit later that year, but the European Community rejected an analogous proposal.
Even in the U.S., chlorofluorocarbons continued to be used in other applications, such as refrigeration and industrial cleaning, until after the discovery of the Antarctic ozone hole in 1985.
After negotiation of an international treaty (the Montreal Protocol), CFC production was sharply limited beginning in 1987 and phased out completely by 1996.
I made no such suggestion.
All I said was that there was a lot of conflicting evidence.
In fact, the first such evidence of a Antartic ozone hole was automatically thrown OUT because the numbers were sooo far away from anything expected, they were assumed to be a measurement error.
In fact it took roughly three years to conclude that the data was real and the hole existed.
During this giant 10 year period from confirmation of discovery thru banning, there was a lot of healthy arguments in the scientific community...something that is still lacking in today's AGW dispute.
Scientific studies are also not self funded.
So who funds these studies?
Perhaps corporations, governments, and people with an agenda are desperately feigning to keep money flowing into the study of global warming as their livelihoods (paychecks) depend on the lies around the THEORY of human influence on global warming.
This is more of the reality that surrounds us presently...sadly.
"We don’t understand what is completely happening other than that the climate is getting hotter and we are contributing to it.
"
Nice try- but no I will not accept that statement.
You state that "we don't understand" but then you reverse that with "other than that the climate is getting hotter and we are contributing to it.
" Devious…very devious-- Fascist tactics with wording to get me to agree with your AGENDA.
It is my personal BELIEF that humans are NOT contributing to global warming based on facts.
Some of which are shown in "The Global Warming Swindle".
Bet you never saw it.
Perhaps heard of it and panned it…
This links to Part 1 of 8 clips- watch them they interview scientists and one of the founders of Greenpeace that all say global warming is not being influenced by the human factor showing facts that dispute otherwise.
You might just get some insight from some honest scientists for once- not those out to obtain a federal grant under the lie of CO2 global warming.
In the part of The Great Climate Change Swindle where I am describing the fact that the ocean tends to expel carbon dioxide where it is warm, and to absorb it where it is cold, my intent was to explain that warming the ocean could be dangerous—because it is such a gigantic reservoir of carbon.
By its placement in the film, it appears that I am saying that since carbon dioxide exists in the ocean in such large quantities, human influence must not be very important—diametrically opposite to the point I was making—which is that global warming is both real and threatening.
We have concerns regarding the use of a graph featured in the documentary titled ‘Temp & Solar Activity 400 Years’.
Firstly, we have reason to believe that parts of the graph were made up of fabricated data that were presented as genuine.
The inclusion of the artificial data is both misleading and pointless.
Secondly, although the narrator commentary during the presentation of the graph is consistent with the conclusions of the paper from which the figure originates, it incorrectly rules out a contribution by anthropogenic greenhouse gases to 20th century global warming.
Atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (379ppm) and CH4 (1774 ppb) in 2005 exceed by far the natural range over the last 650,000 years.
Global increases in CO2 concentrations are due primarily to fossil fuel use, with land-use
That said, i do believe in Global Warming from human activities.
I also believe in Global dimming from sulphur and other particles being released into the atmosphere.
And yet Global dimming is supposed to be decreasing.
This data does make me think again about Global Warming, but at the end of the day pumping out CO2 day in day out isnt a good thing.
Recycling, use of renewable energy and alternatives to oil are all good things even without impending death due to climate change.
As long as we dont go nuts and start mass culls of humans and a go mad on nuclear power there is no harm in sticking with the whole global warming is happening mantra.
Atmospheric concentrations of CO2 were also about 20 times higher than today...millions of years ago.
I guess all those dinosaur SUVs were at fault.
Since we have no real idea why levels were so much higher in the past, it's more than a bit risky to attribute changing levels today specifically to us.
A wise man once said, "There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.
"
They are correct, the planet will be perfectly fine with 50000 ppm CO2, the problem is we will not.
Our societies are built around climate patterns that have not changed much in the last 10k years (except for small events like major volcanic eruptions which caused small fluctuations and other small events).
Climate change (or global warming, whichever term you prefer) effects us.
What were the aerosol levels?
In 1991 a series of volcanic eruptions masked GHG forcings for ~3 years.
You may want to take a look at an history of the atmosphere, and particularly focus on the times when photosynthesis massively occurred first in the seas and later on land ...
Temperature and CO2 ARE related, even if the correlation at some period of the Earth evolution is poor because of the importance of other factors.
It is now accepted even by AGW skeptics (those with a degree higher than high-school) that there is a feedback in the climate system between both.
Now some disagree with the importance of the feedback.
But the bottom line is that anybody with an education in climatology knows that CO2 is not the only parameter to account for (yeah, surprise!
even AGW proponents account for things like the Sun and orbital parameters, water vapor, clouds, the climate circulation patterns, ... imagine that!
).
Even without mentioning the temperature, you may want to check the toxicity thresholds for CO2 ... So no, we wouldn't be happy with 50,000 ppm (even if this level is not really relevant to the discussion).
That 300/5=60, or in other words that out of the supposed .5 degree of global warming, less than 30 millionths of a degree of that can be attributed to CO2?
(I say less; because, convection can be expected to reduce the number considerably.
)
by not true i meant mostly that the world is not cooling, that's cherry picked data, it's a lie.
as for co2 being a trailing indicator, of course it is .
. .
when the cause of global warming is mostly plate tectonics, so you have something like the antarctica dropping over the south pole which has caused our current series of ice ages, then when it gets colder, or warmer, the co2 drop follows geology.
when the cause is biological, the opposite happens like when the karoo ice age ended, when termites learned how to eat wood and release co2 into the atomsosphere.
I don't think global warming is the most important ecological problem on earth, deforestation, making the ocean a desert, these are more critical right now, global warming is a long term thing, also, is it so bad if the earth is a bit warmer?
I don't like how republicans all get on the bandwagon that the cause is the sun when anyone with a high school diploma can see that the last hundred years has seen a lot of human caused global warming.
Anthony Watts is a meteorologist, and he prefers exact language.
In precise terms, no amount of cooling, whatever the cause or degree can "erase" the historical temperature record.
To that end, he suggested the phrasing be that the cooling was "nearly equal in magnitude to the global warming signal".
As the average layman doesn't tend to understand verbiage like this, I demurred and simply removed the quote entirely.
What's his contribution been to climatology?
What original research has he published on climate, as opposed to weather/meteorology?
Global pollution is the issue and climate change is the by-product.
Do you really want to breathe toxic air for the rest of your life?
People with heart disease and asthma are profoundly affected by all kinds of particulate
I absolutely agree that pollution is an important issue.
I hate particulates and toxic chemicals in the air, and I'd love to have a wide variety of cleaner and cheaper energy sources to choose from.
However, CO2 is NOT a pollutant, particulate, or toxic chemical!
We are doing ourselves a huge disservice focusing on such a benign gas!
CO2 doesn't do a lick of harm to asthma sufferers or those with heart disease or lung disorders... Its clean and clear!
Trees love it!
If we're going to be using algae biofuels soon, we're going to need some of that CO2.
Everyone needs to take a good hard second look at this climate change issue, and take a breather from CO2 bashing while the real experts sort things out... We could be needlessly wasting time and resources trying to be carbon neutral, when we really need to be getting our focus back on CLEAN air and CLEAN water.
We all need to stop and look around at all the pain and suffering around us caused by the real human-initiated global disasters: poverty, sickness, violence, genocide, greed, actual pollution, terrorism, drug abuse, etc., etc.
Getting on each others case about our "carbon footprints" is such an absurd waste of time in light of those tragedies.
We have made tremendous strides with technology and real pollution (one of the reasons I am very thankful there is that EPA agency).
The interesting thing about global warming (it's the same thing as climate change, except for the letters) is that the first people that feel the effects are the third world countries.
The reason is a lot of them are based on traditional agriculture without irrigation and are much more exposed to the weather.
In developed countries, you just turn up the AC...
It can even be argued that global warming has already caused a lot of the problems in Africa (lake Chad dried up because of a prolonged drought, and it being dry might be the new 'norm' http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Chad ).
Again, I can't pin this exactly on global warming, but it is predicted that a good portion of Africa will get dryer.
This will cause more difficulties for the people that live there...
Btw, the experts have sorted things out.
The truth is, driving a gasoline car causes global warming which causes bad things to happen.
The lake's decline probably has nothing to do with global warming, report the two scientists, who based their findings on computer models and satellite imagery made available by NASA.
They attribute the situation instead to human actions related to climate variation, compounded by the ever increasing demands of an expanding population.
You're right to say that global warming hurts the third world countries the most.
But you're completely wrong about why.
The reason global warming hurts the poor, is because of do-gooders who wish to prevent them from obtaining all of the advancements that we in the advanced countries enjoy for some mythical "save the planet" reasoning.

We are not about to enter an ice age.
Any implication that we are is just plain false.
2007 was in fact the 2nd hottest year on record after 2005.
The 8 hottest years on record since 1880 occurred in the last 10 years.
Back to the article - What the article is actually reporting is that the temperature in the month of January 2008 was lower than the temperature in the month of January 2007 when using this delta tracking method.
This is supported by the underlying data.
What the story leaves out is the fact that January 2007 was the hottest month on record.
The data from NASA goes back to 1880.
I’m guessing Michael Asher didn’t run an article last year saying that we’ve had the biggest gain in world temperature ever, much worse than the last 50 years of global warming.
Because he could have, using the same standards applied in this article.
The story goes on to claim that solar variances have a greater impact than man made changes to the climate.
This is not correct either.
The facts on the solar variance impact can be found in this document from NASA.
Global warming is real.
It isn’t going to go away by itself.
We’re not about to enter an ice age.
granted yes, saying that we are about to enter another ice-age is a bit over the top (however, I believe most of the statements like that are used in a sort of sarcastic way, like a surprise sucker punch compared to how things were projected, by the models, to occur) and I don't believe anyone here has denied that the earth has experienced, in truth, a modest warming trend, however, and yes, this cold spike could very well just be exactly that, an abrupt spike.
That's not to say, however, that it could not be a trend of things to come.
That's the problem with this darn debate and the major reason why nothing intelligent has been done concerning it; no one is taking the time to just step back and approach this with a calm scientific analysis of data from EVERY side, without jumping to one conclusion or another.
I would like to say though, that history shows that other global warming trends have indeed "gone away" so to speak by themselves through the natural patterns of the earth and universe upon which we rely for life.
The trend in the industry is that the insurance companies are recognizing that climate change is real and they are actively seeking to reduce their risk from global warming.
to say that all businesses, whether u mean just insurance or not, is a lie, there have been plenty of companies that do things to get a good buck, All-state was just called out for it for misusing figures to raise rates in Florida, (and Enron didn't get very far on it's hard data, did it?).
But yes i'm sure they have taken into account that the sea levels have risen ver slightly every year, and that the possibility that the warm water temperatures might attribute to more hurricanes, etc.
but i would doubt very highly that they have taken their information in concern with other forms of climate change, such as wind patterns, solar influences, etc.
Again we come to the same problem, just because someone or a group does something (especially when it is a company interested in its finacial well being, which i don't think of as a bad idea) in coorolation to a particular finding doesn't mean it's cause to rule out the other factors, which scientists are currently attempting to analyze and which could support the hypothesis that there could be more cold weather to come, it's still without a bout up in the air.
Time will tell better than we.
They know that, in the 40 years since the previous peaks in the natural hurricane cycle, Americans have built massively in coastal areas.
That raises insurance losses.
A large amount of recent research has shown no indication of a link between GW and hurricane strength.
This probably accounts for the extremely mild seasons we had in 2006 and 2007.
Weren't you recently arguing that solar insolation changes weren't enough to affect climate?
But if the solar data correlation is correct (still not fully proven) then there should be an increase in global cloud cover, and likely more precipitation as a result.
I have already looked a little into this and I personally found it convincing enough to place a couple bets, so I'm eagerly monitoring such events.... man i hope i'm right... could use a lil more cash.... kinda strapped at the moment : / college life is interesting
The essence of climate is change, evolution, cyclicality.
It's idiotic to speak of "climate change" as if it is the advent of some newly discovered phenomenon.
So let's just call it weather.
Obviously from climate records, weather changes within even 50 year periods are often simply a natural cycling of oceanic and atmospheric tendencies.
BFD. Anyone looking at the mid-troposphere temperature charts brought to us by satellite ( http://www.junkscience.com/MSU_Temps/Warming_Look.... will note the record & gigantic EL Nino of '97-98.
How surprising that ocean and global land temps elevated thereafter (at least in the northern hemisphere), and are now coming down as evinced by the 2007-2008 decline in that record of approximately 0.60°C.
The raised-temp anomaly is petering out.
BFD. All the hysteria induced by over-caffeinated environmentalists and wishful media drones was, yet again, misplaced emotionalism and childish fatalism that arises in cycles as prevalent as temporarily-enduring changes in the weather, oceans and mid atmosphere.
9/11 has warped an unprecedented number of personal psychologies, especially in those most exposed to its tragic images (the media ilk), and those most guilt-ridden about living in the highly consumptive and highly productive USA (the socialists, greenies and sundry malcontents who would denigrate Paradise for its pleasantly immutable continuum).
With the sun going into timid mode, CO2 is deflating as the socio-economic bane exceeded only by Jack the Ripper or HIV.
While fatal heat waves have been common throughout history, record cold and record snow in the last few years are really the anomalies of significance.
Such are known to precede ice ages, precipitation for which is induced by a period of warming weather that is but a gnat's hair on the astrophysical time scale.
So the foolish Cassandras and Tiresiass who ride their bikes with a bag of CFLs should just shut up for a while and cool it.
Unusually hot weather occurred for modest periods prior to Henry Ford and Eli Whitney, as did imposingly icy periods that kicked Greenland's arse and dug out all the beautiful lakes in the Midwest.
It's just the world; mostly saltwater, wrapped in an atmospheric blanket and bombarded by solar flux - victim of an interplay of natural forces that cycle up and down.
Just because a few insects of green hue have learned how to trumpet like discomfited elephants is by no means grounds for mass hysteria; even if half of them are liberal-arts majors pontificating from the media pulpit, espousing "scientific fact" like herbal supplement hawkers in infomercials.
We've become unnecessarily overwhelmed by such "information sources" because most of us are too lazy to devote time to research of scientific articles on the web.
Unwilling to master new terminology and concepts with our overtaxed noggins, we feast at the trough of pre-canned, sensationalist-media Pablum that any cub reporter can lace with epithets and phrases that leave no room for doubt or debate, ostensibly.
It's true the Left has changed tactics lately.
Used to be Paul Ehrlich asking people if they wanted a gondola ride to the Empire State Building due to global warming.
Now eat a hamburger and you've killed Indonesian kids.
Flash forward 500 years.
Massively complex computer models try to predict what is an elegantly simple natural machine, applying all sorts of rules and machinations to prove man-made climate change.
Turns out it's just that pesky sun again.
And the people who reject the dogma -- "deniers" -- a link to Nazi Holocaust "deniers", an explicit reference.
They're banned from conferences, decried as lunatics or fringe or puppets of Big Oil.
Then one day the public started remembering their 3rd Grade earth science.
You know, the one about how "native" Americans came to North America via the land bridge over the Bering sea caused by glaciation?
(new theories also postulate the same thing happended from the European side).
Hey, where did all that ice go, and who was policing the ice sheets in ancient Alaska to ensure SUVs were obeying the chain laws?
Fun fun.
But nobody every accused Al Gore of being smarter than a 3rd Grader.
And nobody has credibly convinced me that the world was better than everything north of Jersey City was once under a mile-thick sheet of ice.
Enjoy it while it lasts.
Next month a spring heat wave will hit, and we'll all be back complaining about the global warming hysteria.
Just remember.
Gore may not have invented the Internet, but don't hold that against him.
He did manage to invent Global Warming!
Just remember.
Gore may not have invented the Internet, but don't hold that against him.
He did damage in inventing Global Warming!
Look back a few more thousand years to the last Ice Age, and the earth is on a warming trend.
Look all the way back to the Devonian, and we're cooling again.
I guess I'm done with these articles on DT.
I always thought that you truly believed that global warming was not really taking place.
Instead, it is pretty clear that you do agree that it could be taking place, but you're simply selecting specific data just to argue otherwise.
I'm sorry you feel that way, but I've always maintained that global warming is occurring, just that the anthropogenic (human-induced) portion is significantly smaller than claimed, and that the data doesn't indicate any reason to be alarmed (i.e.
that the anticipated degree of warming is likely to be only a moderate annoyance in most regions, and even a minor benefit to some).
Please provide an example of Michael Asher's detailed, intelligent, and insightful articles in a subject area other than hysterical reactionary monkey spanking on the climate change issue.
I drive a gas guzzling SUV, watch a 50" plasma TV, fly 85,00 miles a year and drive an additional 12,000.
I keep my AC on 68 and my heater on 76.
I don't recycle, and think I left the oven on this morning.
There is only so much one person can do - I need help.
I beg anyone reading this to increase their carbon footprint before Al Gore starts screaming of the impending ice age.
I am in Atlanta, GA, and we are in a severe drought.
So if Katrina was because of Global Warming, then that would only be a 1 season prediction.
Hurricane prediction has nothing to do with AGW.
Heck, the major hurricane predictions come from a warming denier, Bill Gray in Colo.
Our esteemed Governor Perdue has not found it fit to pray for hurricanes, that's why they have not occurred!
:)
Global warming is a sham.
The Earth's temperature changes.
It has throughout history, with or without Hybrid cars.
As to hurricanes, regardless of the New Denial, Al Gore, RFK, and numerous others have made their notion known that Bush is to blame for Katrina and other storms and sinned gravely by not signing Kyoto.
That's where the hurricane bruha came up.
It is horsemess, of course.
Numerous studies have debunked this highly politicized crappola about AGW being the proximate cause of hurrican intensity.
In fact, some models of AGW indicate that GW might even be a boon not only to food and human health (the diseases caused by heat as a vector are overshadowed by those caused by cold, like the damned flu season).
Not only this, but to hurricanes it seems GW will sheer their tops off!
I did some leg work and went straight to some of the sites that the author was claiming were debunking Global Warming.
Here is another link...
First of all, your links are to NASA stories from 2003 and 2006.
Hardly surprising they don't correlate to 2008 data.
Secondly, no one is claiming that NASA is "debunking" global warming.
The way that the science behind the anthropogenic global warming scare was twisted and mocked up to look like science was an absolute lie!
Imagine the worst case scenario: the scientist that predict global warming will harm the world's ecosystems are right and we have huge political / environmental problems.
The question would be why we did nothing to stop it when it was possible.
Even if we aren't the cause, there is no denying that less CO2 (and other harmful gases), if reduced, can ONLY HELP our atmosphere.
I won't disagree that Global Warming is used much more as a political tool than anything else but it is happening slowly (or quickly) and the numbers are out there.
Whether it's just a glitch or not is something else but at least on my continent, it's considered fact.
The US is something else...
• First Hurricane in documented history (so since at least 200-300 years) has hit South America from the southern Atlantic Ocean.
But let’s say that all this is a fluke and random… One can’t negate the fact that ocean currents are changing.
The Great Barrier Reef, a living breathing biosphere off the coast of Australia that has been around for over that is over 6000 to 8000 years old (thus older than HUMAN history) has seen, in the past TWO years destroyed by over 30% all because of changing temperatures in water.
Most expensive weather caused disasters have all happened in the past 5 years.
- This has nothing to do with Global Warming or Climate Change.
We live in bigger more expensive houses and own more goodies.
People are also getting dumber and building more in disaster zones because it is cheaper.
Yet the human death toll from extreme wather has dropped by 95% in the last 100 years.
First Hurricane in documented history (so since at least 200-300 years) has hit South America from the southern Atlantic Ocean.
- Also had a year (2006) with no hurricanes making landfall in North America.
Arctic Ocean no longer freezing so safe crossing levels since the past 5 to 10 years (for the people living in Greenland for example).
- This is not a new phenomenon and has been recorded by other explorers of other centuries.
Also, why did they name it Greenland?
Could it be because it was not covered in ice when they named it?
Record levels of Antarctic sea ice, record cold in Minnesota, Texas...
After years of spending billions of dollars collecting temp data, the scientific community should be able to produce a correlation coefficient for global warming.
This would tell us what the relative cause and effect that the independent variables have on global warming.
In this case, global warming would be the dependent variable and the most likely independent variables (from published studies) would be sun spot activity, CO2 conc., methane conc., ocean currents, etc.
The scientist should be able to calculate with their vast amounts of data first and second order effects along with any interaction effects among the indpendent variables.
From this, they would have a statistically sound cause and effect analysis that would tell us which causes are the most significant with regards to global warming.
This would end most of the debate that we see in the press on this issue.
I suspect if they did this simple correlation, they might come up with the fact that CO2 has a very tiny effect on global warming... thus drying up their funding and ruining their socialist political agenda.
Otherwise, this analysis would have been done a long time ago by the global warming theorists.
scientists have done these models.
It shows global warming is caused by human produced greenhouse gases.
It's unfortunate that republicans spin this data so hard that their followers don't believe it.
It's incredible really.
Republicans would rather believe a talk show host or republican blogger than a scientist.
I'm not going to bother with data about sun radiance because it doesn't matter, you're gonna keep on believing what they tell you.
I'm not a fan of al gore by the way.
He's got his own axe to grind, and makes all kinds of ridiculous mistakes.
But if you open your eyes, look at the data, it's easy to see, we are causing global warming.
It's not much.
a couple degrees F per hundred years.
That's it.
I'm still waiting for masher to open with the headline "Pollution is a myth!
Air Quality Indexes are meaningless!
" ;)
But what does air quality have to do with global warming?
Not as much as political blogs would have you think.
Cleaning up the environment is an important topic and it has nothing to do with what Al Gore tells you, or what this blog my Michael Asher details.
This in turn would help the air pollution and the cycle goes around.
Global Warming is much more than buying hybrids or some other stupid political plot.
It's about making the Earth in general a cleaner place to live.
See that big old ball of light in the sky?
You know, the one that explodes ever second like all the nukes ever made plus a few million more on an area the size of EARTH!
How DARE- DARE any of you discount that ENERGY that blasts into the Earth constantly as a casual nuisances!
Wow!
Let's step back hundreds of years ago, when some people came to this mysterious land.
Found it fertile and set up home.
As time would pass, the people decided to give their land a name... lets see..WARM climate, fertile fields of crop- AHA!!
Lets call it GREENLAND!
(translated of course from some Euro lingo)... Dang shame the place got hammered by an ICE AGE and has never yet recovered from that.
so there may be a CYCLE in the weather that may yet bring it back.
Rubba up a tree, Left of sanity folks, if you make it to age, oh..let'ce, 254.
That "might" happen.
"The major greenhouse gases are water vapor, which causes about 36–70% of the greenhouse effect on Earth (not including clouds); carbon dioxide, which causes 9–26%; methane, which causes 4–9%, and ozone, which causes 3–7%.
"
Just a few simple questions for those who believe that anthropogenic global warming is the real deal.
CO2 appears in our atmosphere in a concentration of 380 parts per million by volume which is .038%.
Of this amount only a tiny fraction is caused by our emissions.
Given this:
1.
What is the mechanism by which this gas, in this concentration, drives the climate of our planet?
2.
What is the ideal concentration of atmospheric CO2 that would give us the perfect climate?
(And, what constitutes a perfect climate?
)
2.
You're right in what you state implicitly: there is no 'ideal' concentration and no 'perfect' climate.
I am not sure anybody a little bit serious has defended such a position, or a serious clarification of the definition of 'ideal' and 'perfect' should be provided.
On the other hand, there are definitely bad concentrations, but we're far from them.
However, there is definitely a climate (weather patterns, water resources, sea level) under which most major infrastructures of current civilization have developed (major ports, major cities, location and types of crops ...).
Reshuffling these patterns is likely to cost a lot in an adaptation process (whether it's money or lives for some).
We could exchange citations with regard to atmospheric CO2 concentrations and their cause over past 500,000 years all day long but unless and until you answer my first question the discussion is moot.
I want to know what is the mechanism whereby changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration leads to drastic changes in our climate.
In addition, just stating that some concentrations are bad without somehow quantifying your argument is deliciously vague but not too helpful to the discussion.
If we know that change in CO2 concentration causes climate change there must be some optimum range for this gas that we would find acceptable;if so, how do we attain and maintain this range?
It also follows that if there is an upper limit that is acceptable there must also exist a lower limit that would yield adverse results in the other direction.
If we do not know any of these things what are we doing banning and/or regulating everything from cow flatulence to incandescent bulbs.
We are blindly flailing about looking for solutions when we really don't have enought knowledge to intelligently define the problem.
Ready, Fire, Aim.
Global cooling, Global warming and environmentalism are distractions.
As the mass media creates climate illusions, Big Brother clamps down by opening our mail, suspending habeas corpus, stealing private lands, banning books like "America Deceived" from Amazon, rigging elections, conducting warrantless wiretaps and starting wars based on blatant lies.
Prevent our loss of rights then handle the environment.
Now over here in small greece like everywhere else in the western world we have been bombarded by both views of the matter of handling natural resources and adapting to our planets climate like every other creature throughout all those millions of years life existed on it.
No wait actually that has never happened what has happened is that people who think eating a burger and smoking makes you worse than stalin or hitler and people who think pollution is a lie and that the international communist conspiracy seeks to sap our precious bodily fluids have been screaming and yelling their biased opinions based on
There is no conclusive evidence on either side.
We may or may not affect the climate.
From what i've read and heard and watched its 50-50.
But THAT is not important.
What is important is that climate is not or has ever been normal like so many other have said before.
That is a fact.
which means that the climate will change whether we affect it or not.
Which in turn means that trying to "fix" it will not help in the long term.
What must be done is study it with un-biased cold logic and from what i've seen that is not happening.
Global warming or cooling, naturally occurring ice ages and temperature variations that threaten our way of life have been around since the beginning of the earth long before man.
None of that should have anything to do with i.e.
reducing pollution.
We should reduce pollution because it degrades our quality of life.
We should move away from finite power sources to renewables because finite powers sources well THEY RUN OUT!
counties SHOULD PROTECT THEIR ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE THEIR CITIZENS LIVE IN IT NOT BECAUSE AL GORE OR A VERY VERY SAD PANDA COME TO GREECE TO BATHE US IN THEIR INFINITE WISDOM!
They should move away from oil because nobody in their right mind wants to be Dependant of people like putin or shavez for their daily survival.
Many of the posts i've read here come from people who apparently belong in the category of people with a brain in their head instead of compost or nuclear waste like tree-huggers and neo-cons but unfortunately opinions like that are never given the credit they deserve from both liberal and conservative media not just in the US but here in Greece as well.
Shame
The problem with using "climate change" as a proxy to push "oil independence" is the two issues so often conflict.
Most GHG emissions are *not* due to oil (the entire transportation sector accounts for only some 17% of total emissions, according to the UN).
For the US, utilizing more domestic natural gas would reduce oil imports, but raise emissions.
Which is the proper course to take?
Which fits in nicely with global warming figures for this time period.
it does present more creditable suggestions that if the glacier keeps moving into the sea, then there would be a relatively ~(I'm using this term only because the time frame quote from the scientists in the article is "decades or a century" and decades, say just two is a relatively short period, though it is longer than the length of my life thus far, which seemed like forever haha)~ quick increase in global sea levels by 25 cm, there is doubt would cause damage to coastal cities and estuaries ecosystems.
However, this has happened to the world before, and plants and animals have sprung back from such events.
Does anyone have information pertaining to the periods of earlier glacial melting, and how it may have affected civilizations in the past?
Hence the current global warming hysteria is a sham.
Its time we put all these climate change deniers behind bars, just like they used to put all those flat earth deniers behind bars.
The phrase "*global* cooling" is a straw man as is "Global Warming Denier", since the "global" part of it is junk science statistics or just wishful thinking by some scientist lucky enough to find a tiny spot on the glue planet called Gaia (originally coined as being a self-REGULATING organism with Mankind becoming it's evolved brain).
The South Pole is getting colder.
So is Greenland.
Same with all rural parts of Austalia.
In all of those places, temperature is going DOWN.
I'm sorry, but arctic circle warming is not "global" warming, and trying to use cute but rather evil white bears as your symbol of anti-capitalist justice is just rude, given that it's open hunting season on Polar Bears, since 13 of 14 regional populations of them are INCREASING, and they follow their noses to the arctic equivalent of Suburbia, and they eat children.
Australia!!!
Massive drought there, blamed on "man-made global warming" so a Gore-like president just wont election and signed up for Kyoto.
Oh, I already posted that graph, above.
"People with heart disease and asthma are profoundly affected by all kinds of particulate in the atmosphere.
"
Utterly agreed.
Now ask what is the effect of the Global Warming scare on helping to fix that bad situation?
It makes people hate Environmentalism in general, so real issue like this, in which there is *no* "debate" as *not* addressed.
And instead of real endangered species, we get what?
Polar Bears!!!
I cannot believe we are living through a new Dark Ages, in which science is lead by the nose by a new church of Gaia.
The Earth is a self regulating system.
If temperature increases more ice melts, meaning more water into the system.
Which in turns is evaporated and creates more clouds.
More clouds means less sun and more rain.
Also please note that one of the major points people made about global warming was not that it was increasing the temperature of the earth, but the fact that all the CO2 we are putting into the air is being absorbed by the biggest carbon sink we have, the ocean.
The levels of carbon in the ocean are so extreme right now that is already affecting the feeder species (lowest part of the food chain) Also please do not forget the amount of damage we are already doing by hunting further down the food chain, as we kill of predator fish.
Al Gore, did all of the mastodon bar-b-que's melt of that thing called the ice age?
What a dork.
I'm buying property in Mexico to avoid the coming ice fields in California.
The global warming crowd is preaching urgency so they can say they saved the planet from destruction.
They keep saying we must act "immediately" so we don't all die.
This way they can justify their existence and state they saved the planet.
They are failing with the man made global warming hype and the truth is coming to fast for them to sound credible.
Isn't it great, Al Gore came along in time to save us from global warming.
And to think, he was already to throw in the towel.
He said it was too late to do anything about it but, obviously his efforts worked.
He will certainly go down in history with the likes of Edison.
He created the internet and saved the world.
What a real hero he truly is.
I guess now that the world is cooling off we can go back to driving 8-mile per gallon gas hogs.
I am hoping to get a club cab with a hemi.
Thanks Al!
A fully funded "Manhattan type" project might be able to predict if the Industrial Revolution created global warming, or if in fact it is even happening.
In the mean time, the complexity of weather patterns HAS been amenable to "political" whims.
While countries like Germany spend billions to eliminate fossil fuels, any "result" they have could NEVER have an impact of global warming, even if it was caused by the Industrial Revolution.
There may be many excellent reasons to decrease the use of fossil fuels, including the "possibility" that this might reduce global warming...if it was caused by the Industrial Revolution.
However, that is by no means certain...on either part of the equation.
The truth is that planet Earth has undergone millions of climate changes, some caused by vulcanic actitivity, space debris, changes in the polarity of the Earth itself, and of course changes in the Sun's level of energy production.
It is obvious to me that global warming is a direct result of global cooling and as we approach 6 1/2 billion on this earth we need to stop all the flatulence of humans and the cattle and others we feed on.
Oil at $100 plus a barrel is more of a concern to me than all the flatulence here.
Time to get the well drillers going up there in Alaska and off the California coast and Florida coast and leave the Saudis and other such with nothing to sell.
Ok, after reading the umpteen posts on this, I felt I had to weigh in.
I've got some background in this, several months of research back in school, before anyone flames me.
Rationally, I think most people can agree that Global Warming/Cimate change is a complex issue.
There really is no right and wrong, the warmers being all right or the coolers being all right.
From my research of the IPCC site (scoff at their nobel prize all you want) and the the GISS site http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs/ it appears that this new data is simply a variation.
We may simply be in a "trough" of the variation, lets look at next year before we make any sweeping conclusions.
My main beef with many who say their opinions are the end all be all is that this issue is way too complex for anyone to say "oh well this is all politically motivated bs".
When we look at the warming side of the matter, CO2, methane, and a handful of other gases are known "climate forcing" agents, wiki it.
They trap sunlight.
Heat the earth.
However water vapor is the main "greenhouse gas" More of it in the air, the more heat earth can absorb.
Ahh, but the catch is that water vapor also contributes to cloud formation, which reflects sunlight and thus "forces" a global cooling effect, ref: http://ams.allenpress.com/perlserv/?request=get-ab... from the american meteorological society.
Another link summarizing http://www.cfact.org/site/view_article.asp?idCateg...
I also have to agree that the suns radiative output reaching earth has to do alot with our temps, however is jury is still how the sun works, so scientists need more time.
One last thing I want to mention is about the oceans, outgassing of CO2 and methane hydrates, you know the nifty ice like substance thats supposed to replace oil?, well outgassing of that is bad and that happens when the oceans warm, which they have been, and all this WILL cause + temp climate forcing, no doubt.
Can cloud cover counteract that force?
We, meaning scientists, concerned citizens, will not know until computer models get better.
Finally, this is not liberal hippy junk, read it all, read the links, the data.
My opinion does not color what I just wrote, its the facts.
Point of fact, dumping tons upon tons of carbon into the atmosphere HAS an effect, fact, and clear cutting forests, natural carbon sinks, also HAS an effect, now will someone venture to guess what those effects are?
Then new trees are planted, very fast growing breeds, which are again clearcut, and tons and tons of carbon dioxide are removed from the air.
Your comments are great, one of the few that are balanced, but it also says science needs more time (and money) all the while politicians and lobby groups are SCREAMING WITH PANIC to force upon us the largest economic shut down in history besides the fall of the Roman Empire.
And as their scientific "consensus" is being debunked as we speak, they are becoming more and more shrill and, well crazy, developing blindspots as they are blindsided by real science and are causing a massive backlash not only against climate science, but against all of it, now beginning to include the equally politicized from pseudo-science of nutrition research and the old or new "fool pyramid" which by odd coincidence exactly coincided with a massive obesity epidemic in modern societies.
The entire atmosphere is undergoing a chemical reaction.
New, unpredictable weather patterns are emerging.
Ice storms over a third of China, wind storms shutting down Tokyo and Paris.
People flash-frozen into their cars in Colombia.
The Arctic, Antarctic, a majority of the world's glaciers melting at an ever-increasing pace.
Millions displaced from unparalleled flooding.
The first known typhoon-to-hurricane hemisphere cross.
The San Diego fires, the Greece fires.
The other is the response of our atmosphere to this energy.
This is impacted by greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4 and a host of others that are generally both natural and anthropogenic, although some of the bad ones are only anthropogenic), particulate, aerosols, etc.
Just do the math- the earth experiences 15 pounds of atmosphere on every square inch of its surface.
Its diameter is prox 8000 miles.
the formula for the surface of a sphere is 4 times pi (3.1416) times r squared (1/2 of 8000= 4000) and comes to 2201062400 square miles, times 27878400 (5280 squared) comes to 5605298012160000 square feet, times 144 (square inches per sq foot) and comes to 807162913751040000 square inches, times 15 (pounds per square inch), that comes to 12107443706265600000 pounds of atmosphere (air) weiging down on the surface of the planet.
The global out put of greenhouse gasses is 25000000000 metric tons times 2205 pounds per ton=55125000000000 pounds.
The new data from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration also suggest that the rate of increase of the gas may have accelerated in the last two years.
Carbon dioxide emissions, mainly from burning fossil fuels, are thought to be a principle cause of global warming.
When the US team started recording atmospheric carbon dioxide in the late 1950s, levels were around 315 ppm and have risen ever since.
in 1950 we were emitting 1/5 of what we are today.
If we add one quarter ppm (we added much less)over the last 50 years average, then we added 12.5 ppm (much more than we have added and not counting the normal gas recycling of the planets ecosystem)in the last 50 years.
I figured I would step in with a new thread.
My atempt is not to defend nor take 'sides' on this issue.
I agree with the Facts that yes, pollution is bad.
Yes CO2 is one of the causes of 'climate change' or what ever they are calling it at this point.
Yes the 'powers that be' make comercial use of it, sell their religion, policts, or products based on the fear it drives.
But what bothers me is that 1st.
We as a developed country, and those that are racing to be like us, are like rats.
Comsume, polute, and do more damage because "we have a right to" and pass off the personal responsibility leaving it up to the 'others' to fix it so we can drive our SUV to pick up our latte.
(figure of speach folks).
Then we poke in the dark at what what we know little about.
Yes we have ice cores, some fossel records that show some things.
But yet the media never seems to release 'other' data because it does not serve thier purpose.
Case in point (we have to blame CO2 if we want to Tax it).
I believe we should all be green, but do not believe it will help what is happening.
Like putting a sumppump next the levy in the south.
But will can still be better humans.
Holding back information from the public is also to blame as is dis-information.
Such as was anyone aware that not only is our atmosphere changing, so are the 'other' planets within our solar system?
Interesting eh?
This is verified by NASA from what I had read on thier website.
Something about atmospheric density and at least one other..forgive my details (you can go look foryourself), has changes it's pole.
We are creatures that get too comfortable and fat, my friends...time is a changing and it should be interesting.
As much as we think we can 'fix' everything, we are still at the mercy of the ever changing enviorment and idiots if we think we can change it without causing other problems..we still have alot to learn.
Do your research, and do not follow the main stream media as law..(remember it's purpose is to draw you attention, to sell ad space...but that is a topic for somewhere else).
The year 1816 was famous as "the year without a summer.
" That year started out, in Stanley as well as other regions of the south, so mild for the months of January and February that many folks let their fires go out and burned wood only for cooking; however, March was very cold and windy.
Showers started the Month of April but ended with snow and ice.
In May the temperature was like that of winter.
The young buds that began forming in April were stiff and frozen.
Ice, one half inch thick formed on ponds and rivers in North and South Carolina.
Corn was killed and after being planted again and again nothing was reaped from the cornfields.
June was cold, the coldest month ever experienced in this latitude.
Almost all green things as well as fruits were killed.
There was ice, frost, and some snow flurries in July.
August proved to be the worst month of all not only here but even in Europe.
September started out with two weeks of pleasant weather and the rest of the month was cold.
October and November were extremely cold and then December was mild.
This extraordinary weather condition in 1816 had been caused by the volcanic eruption of Mt.
Temboro in the Dutch East Indies, blowing 50 cubic miles of dust into the air and killing some 66,000 people.
The volcanic dust clouded the skies all over the earth causing doom and gloom and the "year without a summer.
"
I think not.
Volcanoes put more CFC's into the atmosphere every day than all of mankind has already done.
Follow the money= many companies (GE, governments-federal and local) and People (Gore) stand to benefit ($) from the fear of Global Warming (I mean climate change).
There is a big difference between trying not to pollute and attributing global warming to humans as the culprit.
If you watched Al's little show but you haven't watched "The Great Global Warming Swindle" then I highly - highly recommend you watch it for perspective.
People preying on the fears of others for gain- attributing the cause of global warming on humans and to ask them to pay up (carbon footprints) is the same as a religion asking you to pay money to have your sins forgiven.
It is the great global warming religion preaching fear to the masses and Al Gore is their Prophet (profit)...plain and simple.
A Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) tree-ring width chronology from Jämtland, in the central Scandinavian Mountains, built from living and sub-fossil wood, covering the period 1632 BC to AD 2002, with a minor gap during AD 887–907, is presented.
This is the first multi-millennial tree-ring chronology from the central parts of Fennoscandia.
Pine growth in this tree line environment is mainly limited by summer temperatures, and hence the record can be viewed as a temperature proxy.
Using the regional curve standardization (RCS) technique, pine-growth variability on short and long time scales was retained and subsequently summer (June–August) temperatures were reconstructed yielding information on temperature variability during the last 3600 years.
Several periods with anomalously warm or cold summers were found: 450–550 BC (warm), AD 300–400 (cold), AD 900–1000 (the Medieval Warm Period, warm) and AD 1550–1900 (Little Ice Age, cold).
The coldest period was encountered in the fourth century AD and the warmest period 450 to 550 BC.
However, the magnitude of these anomalies is uncertain since the replication of trees in the Jämtland record is low during those periods.
The twentieth century warming does not stand out as an anomalous feature in the last 3600 years.
Two multi-millennial tree-ring chronologies from Swedish and Finnish Lapland, which have previously been used as summer temperature proxies, agree well with the Jämtland record, indicating that the latter is a good proxy of local, but also regional, summer temperature variability.
Climate change IS hedge-betting.
Whatever happens, see we told you so.
Well isn't that convenient?
Greenies were breathless in 2005 when hurricanes were evidence of warming; where are they now?
Isn't snowfall and cold and ice evidence of the opposite?
What do you mean one year doesn't make a trend?
It did when it served their argument.
Reminds me of an oldie but a goodie: Haven't heard much about the Ozone Hole lately... is there still a hole or has it been filled in?
Doesn't anybody in the media remember that?
We should be in the middle of a little ice age about the year 2024-2025.
The major reason is that the increased salinity from the Mediterranean (and Black and Caspian) Sea is changing the major currents in the Atlantic.
If we want to do something constructive, we should dam the Strait of Gibraltar to prevent this.
While your proposal sounds good and helpful in theory (pending disaster ect...) it is in fact the same strategy being imposed on the world today.
Just tweak the argument to say that we need the ozone as it prevents global warming and instead of building a dam for the solution, tell people to buy all eco friendly products instead.
Either argument results in money flowing to those that offer the so-called "solution" while we pay through the nose with our money and freedoms.
In all of the "sky is falling" rhetoric from the AlGores of the world, why is it that we've never heard them tell us what the optimum temperature for the earth is?
We've seen periods in history where cooler temperatures resulted in massive losses of life due to crop failures and disease epidemics.
So what's the ideal temperature?
One degree, two degrees or more COOLER than we have now, or is a more ideal temperature to sustain human life actually WARMER than it is now?
These alarmists love to use anecdotal evidence to point to "man-made global warming", but even if that IS the case, is it possible that it could be a GOOD thing?
Just some food for thought .
. .
I think Al Gore should give his Nobel Peace Prize for global warming back...
Hey Al Gore: the 90's called, and they want their global warming back!
I am still amazed how all the brains seem to have died and bowed at the altar of worshiping "global warming" and now "global cooling.
" Science has shown that climate has fluctuated in the past.
Just because some arrogant people try to jam their opinion (that there is "global warming") down our throats does not make it fact.
Science is not politics nor should it be in lock step with the news media and the "green" forces trying to convince us that something exists when it might not in fact be happening.
Frankly this article simply reaffirms that the Nobel organization should be noble and ask Al Gore to return the peace prize and apologize to the hundreds of millions on the planet who have endured record cold, snow, floods, and weather conditions that reflect the nearly normal ebb and flow of climate fluctuations.
If the "green" groups were truly scientific they would be in an on-going discussion about the climate and what minimal impact humans have when compared to the sun.
I suspect they will go further with their persistent demands that all bow and kiss their feet (or other body parts) in worship of their brilliance when it comes to "global warming.
" I am waiting for one of these self-declared geniuses to claim that "global warming" is actually caused by the population increase in the last few decades.
Then they will act like Hitler, Stalin, Pol Phot or Mao and begin eliminating the surplus population (the people who oppose their dictatorial mandates or refuse to think like mind numbed robots).
The argument used to be that carbon emissions and greenhouse gasses were warming the planet...and that if we didn’t cut those emissions (thereby reduce the global temperature), the ice caps would melt yada yada yada enter Al Gore.
Since the data is inconsistent with this theory, they have to change what they call the phenomenon and the entire argument so they don’t lose face for being wrong all these years.
Never mind that planet earth has historically undergone Multiple mass extinctions from both ice-ages and naturally occurring global warming events (think T-Rex) long before we humans swam ashore.
Consider that we only thrive within a very narrow balance between too close to the Sun and too far away.
I for one have always believed that the sun is the determining factor way over and above anything us humans could possible do.
So, for all those global warming nuts think of this.
Lets say we cause 10% of any climate change ( I think it's more along the lines of 2 - 3%) and we make a correction of 5%, somehow.
How would that cause anything to change?
5% of 10% of a total of 100% leaves not much of any change.
If it's 5% of 2 - 3%, then it's even worse.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but hasn't the debate over the past few years shifted from "we're facing global warming" to "we're facing climate change"?
What debate?
I thought that global warming had been decided and that only a delusional denier would dare blaspheme against this Holy Grail.
To people like Maven trying to play the "Climate Change" game: Yeah, your comment comes across as lame as it sounded when you wrote it.
When you construct an argument that takes in all possibilities as proof of your argument, you are no better than "Psychic" frauds like Miss Cleo.
I caught on to the game when the History Channel ran their crappy global warming show that essentially said Global Warming might result in severe winters, with the Hudson River freezing over as it did during the "Little Ice Age.
" Talk about hedging your bets.
Stop it, already.
The climate changes.
That's what it does.
Always has.
Always will.
2.21 inches of precipitation fell in January.
This was -0.01 inches less than the 1901-2000 average, the 65th driest such month on record.
The precipitation trend for the period of record (1895 to present) is -0.01 inches per decade.
As Professor Gold postulated years ago, the feedback system works like this: The ice cover on the Artic melts, which means substantially more atmospheric moisture flows from the Artic to Canada, Siberia, and Greenland.
This atmospheric moisture ends up as snow.
The snow cover reflects more heat, cooling the atmosphere, and incidentially growing icepacks.
This removes water from the ocean.
As the ocean level drops, the flow of warm surface water from the remains of the Gulf Stream into the Artic near Spitzbergen diminishes, cooling the Artic Ocean, which leads to a refreezing of the ice, which reduces the snowfall, which in turn raises sea level.
Global Warming started when Toyota hired Al Gore to fly around the world and try and convence people to buy more Toyotas to help reduce the green house emmisions and save energy.
Do we really beleive that Al could afford to fly around in a charter jet and make a stupid documentary film using his own money because he was concerned about Global Warming?
pps: nothing that exists as less than 300 parts per million in our atmosphere is ever going to be likely to store and release enough heat to impact global temperature by any measurable amount.
CO2 least of all - it has the same radiant forcing as oxygen.
Oxygen is tens of thousands of times more abundant.
Now maybe you will believe us, when we tell you these facts.
"Everything that supposed to be up is down, and everything that is supposed to be down is up" Algore proclaimed this during his ill-fated presidential campaign.
These words can be said about his theory of global warming.
What was supposed to be up, ie.
global temperature is down, way down.
There is now evidence that the Earth is going the opposite direction than the vaunted computer models have predicted.
This year we have seen record cold all over the globe.
China is in a deep freeze, it has snowed in Baghdad, the first time in recorded history.
In Iceland and Greenland icecaps that have been receding and have been used as evidence of global warming are reforming.
Scientists do not know why this is happening but they suspect it is a decrease in solar activity.
They are now acknowledging that the sun plays a much larger roll in earth's climate and trumps anything humankind is doing.
There is a HUGE differnce between pollution of our planet & global warming..It is a PROVEN fact that solar activity determines the climate of our planet...if not...HOW do you explain them ??
?...If global warming "climate change" is due to HUMANS....HOW do you explain the climate changes on Mars & the other planets in our solar system???
?
It was mild in Arizona today with high pollen, because my sinuses are killing me.
Should we expect the Salt River that is normally dry in the summer to rise and add more dust?
Or do you think we may have more dew on our lillies this year?
"your" means "a form of the possessive case of you used as an attributive adjective: Your jacket is in that closet.
I like your idea.
Compare yours.
" so what you said makes no sense... I think what you meant to say is "you're" which is a pronunciation key... Contraction of you are.
Which whould make sense.
You must have gone to college... I love it when people in love with the idea of climate change cannot debate the facts and attack the person relaying them.
Global Warming (er, pardon--Climate Change) has nothing to do with CO2.
Instead, all indications point to the active agent being the rise in pornography.
Clearly, one must admit that it fits the time frame more closely and accurately than CO2.
Just think how cold it would have been this year if it weren't for Global Warming.
We are not looking at a single year here, we are looking at a trend...sigh.
When you plot these over time, the warming trend does continue.
Let's wait to see what next year brings.
Also, instead of debating whether or not there is Global Warming...lets get rational about its cause: what can be attributed to standard cycles vs. man induced.
I would guess both are to blame...just how much of each should be the topic.
The year 1816 was famous as "the year without a summer.
" That year started out, in Stanley as well as other regions of the south, so mild for the months of January and February that many folks let their fires go out and burned wood only for cooking; however, March was very cold and windy.
Showers started the Month of April but ended with snow and ice.
In May the temperature was like that of winter.
The young buds that began forming in April were stiff and frozen.
Ice, one half inch thick formed on ponds and rivers in North and South Carolina.
Corn was killed and after being planted again and again nothing was reaped from the cornfields.
June was cold, the coldest month ever experienced in this latitude.
Almost all green things as well as fruits were killed.
There was ice, frost, and some snow flurries in July.
August proved to be the worst month of all not only here but even in Europe.
September started out with two weeks of pleasant weather and the rest of the month was cold.
October and November were extremely cold and then December was mild.
This extraordinary weather condition in 1816 had been caused by the volcanic eruption of Mt.
Temboro in the Dutch East Indies, blowing 50 cubic miles of dust into the air and killing some 66,000 people.
The volcanic dust clouded the skies all over the earth causing doom and gloom and the "year without a summer.
"
I think not.
Volcanoes put more CFC's into the atmosphere every day than all of mankind has already done.
One, we know that a better measure of human activity is not climate change, but air quality.
Am I making sense so far?
Now where in the world is air quality and economic growth been managed and reconciled most efficiently.
Are you ready for this?
Right here in Southern California.
That's right folks.
Anyone alive who lived here in the 1950's know that air quality, despite quantum leaps in economic growth is significantly better.
Could it be better still?
Of course, but Southern California and all of California has led the technological advance and we will remain in the lead.
Our governor wants more leadership still.
I respectfully submit that what is needed is not more leadership but more followers.
Not just here in the United States, but around the world.
And especially around the world in rapidly developing countries in this exploding global economy.
I know what I am talking about.
And you should too.
For example, are not the olympic games being threatened by bad air quality in Bejing, China?
Were they threatened in Los Angeles?
Yes, but not air, traffic was the worry.
We handled that nicely.
Be honest and look around the globe.
A California-style attack, a genuine protocol,against bad air will be the best offense over the near term (50 years) to alleviate man-made economic effects.
Now if my logic is correct, will this not also address the zealous war against global warming.
Of course, but perhaps not for some.
Many zealots have a different agenda.
For whatever reason, climate change occurs.
The seas will ebb and flow.
For now, not melting ice, but rising seas need to be managed.
Really folks, we actually do need more fresh water anyway.
Let's deal with that.
We do know how.
Thank you Neal.
I hope the climate changes every year I inhabit the earth.
The scientific fact is that the NORMAL climate conditions are ALWAYS CHANGING.
If the climate stopped changing, then it would be abnormal.
Thinking man has an effect on the climate is frankly ethnocentric.
We are insignificant and irrelevant on the cosmic scale.
The biggest consistent contributor to our ever-changing climate is the Sun (solar activity,flares, sunspots, solar wind) and interstellar cosmic rays from Gamma Ray bursts, Supernovae, and other unknown cosmic phenomena.
The rise of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, although miniscule relative to other gasses like water vapor, is not the CAUSE of warming, but the EFFECT of warming.
To illustrate this it in layman's terms, bring a bottle of Coke close to the point of freezing.
Open it.
Very little carbon dioxide escapes (its dissolved in the water).
Take another bottle and warm it to 150 degrees F. Then open it.
You get a jet of water because carbon dioxide is escaping.
Large bodies of water act the same over decades or centuries, absorbing and releasing carbon dioxide in a delayed synchronization with changes in global temperature: lakes, oceans, calderas.
First the temperature rises, then these bodies of water release the carbon dioxide.
When global temperatures drop, carbon dioxide follows and is reabsorbed into water.
motive, as in global warming, the minds of the believers
Can't the oil companies benefit from Global Warming fears!?
I mean then the government will use taxation to fund those companies' R&D so that they can find new energy methods and then push those methods into the main-stream with more sticking power??
?
I guess Al Gore will have to run around in a parka and mukluks while he's telling us the earth is getting warmer.
Or he'll start telling us the next ice age is coming.
Maybe he'll hang around with a wooly mamoth, sloth and saber-toothed tiger.
Sounds like a video I've seen.
As one of the few people left in this world that wholly supports Pres.
George W. Bush I am disappointed that he has bought into "global warming.
" It is totally evident, simply from the discussions on this page, that global warming is something we don't understand yet.
There is evidence supporting many different theories.
I don't know much about science but I know a lot about politics and the economy.
Global warming is having a much less severe influence on our climate system than it is having on the poor people of this world.
Most people in this world can't afford energy costs as it is.
"Updating" to renewable energy is going to cost a lot of money.
Is Al Gore going to make up the difference for that with his carbon credits he sells to himself?
No, the poor people of this world that work hard just to pay the bills are going to feel the weight of that political monster.
I wish "scientists" who disguise themselves as experts on television would be more interested in those people than whatever agenda they are trying to further.
I am not saying that climate change isn't an item of concern, it is.
Personally I believe the data that shows CO2 increases following warming (and then the water warms up and more and more CO2 is released into the atmosphere).
However, that doesn't matter.
Keep studying it!
Just don't throw it on the shoulders of the public until we are really needing to.
"Sadly, you people just don't get it.
Global cooling is caused by global warming.
The Earth has a fever, and now it has chills.
The debate is over.
" -- Al Gore
The United Nations claim they will need $20 trillion of the citizens dollars to attack global warming.
Before even considering spending that kind of money, we must demand an national debate.
If the scientific under-pinnings of global warming theory are sound, it's supporters would embrace the dialogue instead of attempting to stifle it.
There IS consensus among most meteorologists and climatologists about AGW being the proximate cause of slight warming over the past century.
Mellish makes sure we understand that cyclic variations in snow or hurricane intensity and dry or cold spells in and of themselves cannot prove anything one way or another.
Al Gore is just as wrong to use hot summers for his concerns in saving Mother Earth to prove something as are kids playing in snow in Madrid.
One model of AGW has more water vapor in the air due to even small temps increase, thus possibly bringing about more snow until such time as those areas that are infrequently seen with snowfall (like, well, Madrid) lose snow altogether.
Of course this could take a long time.
decades. Or not?
I distinctly remember one morning in Atlanta Georgia as a youngster in 1981 where the temperature fell to 5 below zero F. Not happened since.
And most unlikely anymore.
There was NOT a consensus outside the editorial staff at Newsweek, however, that the planet was heading to an ice age in the 70s.
Oopsy. I remember the claim even as I was a little tyke back then.
But it was never based on "science.
"
An even better question than that is, If we are entering a state of global cooling Shouldn’t we be proactive and begin drilling off our continental shelf, the ANWR, and invest more money in shale oil?
How come some of these fellows with the big telescopes say that they can see that the polar CO2 (Carbon Dioxide, for those of the audience in Rio Linda) "ice"-caps on Mars are receding?
The observations shown in this graph are entirely expected.
Many learned scientists have stated that short intense winters, and long hot summers, are indicitive of global warming.
This does not mean that the pressue is off and we can return to our cavalier attitude of irresponsible stewardship.
There should still be a concerted effort to: 1)calculate the optimum planetary heat load, 2)estimate the limits of electrostatic precipitation, & 3)develop legislation to insure global accountability.
People!
There is no NORMAL climate condition.
It's always either getting hotter or colder and we can't stop it either way.
This planet has been undergoing constant change form its beginning and we are a mere footnote in the history of this planet’s evolution.
Let’s talk about problems we can solve for a change.
Relatively speaking you are but a speck of dust in the universe and your life is but the twinkle of an eye the entire span of modern human civilization has been around but a mere second and to the rest of the universe is totally irrevelant.
The whole Man Made Global Warming philosophy -- if that's what you can call it -- is merely the new home of the Stalinists and the Marxists.
It has little to do with real science.
Otherwise, proponents like Al Gore would be jumping at the chance to debate these issues, rather than demur with the claim that "the science is in, the issue is settled".
As for the Stalinist/Marxist claim, just look at their solutions: many openly state that they want to tear down the standard of living in the US and other industrialized nations; China, India and other newly industrialized nations are exempt from the Kyoto Protocols; they want strict limits on growth, the kind of car we drive, how large our homes can be, all while they (the leaders of the Global Warmism Movement) live the limosine lifestyle of Al Gore.
Man Made Global Warming is nothing by a lot of hot air!
The myriad of predictions and complete WAGs (wild-a** guesses) that tag along with AGW destroy any credibility AGW is trying to achieve.
If the predictions of a theory don't match what happens, the theory is wrong, period.
If AGW proponents really believed that AGW definitely predicts beyond any doubt whatsoever increased hurricane activity that would hit America, then the year 2006 showed AGW is beyond any doubt whatsoever wrong.
If you think the recent UN climate conference in Bali sort of sent the wrong message about environmental stewardship, the "Earth Summit 2002" in Johannesburg, South Africa definitely sent the wrong message on poverty and sustainable development.
"Two miles from the convention center lies one of Johannesburg's poorest slums, Alexandra, where tin shacks line the banks of the polluted Jukski river and children line up for a drink at open standpipes.
"
Thank you for your article informing us that the four major global temperature tracking outlets (Hadley, NASA's GISS, UAH, RSS) have data showing that global temperatures have dropped precipitously over the past year.
I hope you will follow up by identifying the motive for the "Big Lie" - that the Sun is a steady heat source so mankind must have caused global warming.
If past experience is any guide, then proponents of AGW (anthropologic global warming) will not be deterred by new data.
It appears that NASA and other federal agencies that allowed the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to direct their science were caught off-guard by the public's sudden interest in global warming.
NASA's reputation as a space agency and the reputation of NAS as supervisors of federal science agencies will both suffer if the public learns that NASA has hidden data for decades that showed the Sun - the source of Earth's heat and the source of global climate change - is not a steady H-fusion reactor [6].
Now that the northern hemisphere is encrusted in ice and snow for the time being, what about the issue of reflectivity, even temporarily?
Albedo, or the reflectivity of any substance, is high for ice for example and low for dark asphalt.
Many people find it difficult to believe that the Moon's albedo is about that of dark asphalt like you see on the highway.
Yet how bright!
Ice being so much more and thus why the poles are cold in addition to coldness merely for being tilted more away from the Sun and thus less insoleration.
Now then, even for a few months, are we going to see a lag effect of chilling of the earth as the increased reflectivity of the N.Hemispheric ice sends much of the insolaration back into space?
As for CO2: I've collected some info on soot's very large warming role in the atmosphere & its huge effect in the Arctic.
Note the time span on these articles & yet all the fear-mongering in the same time frame about Kilimanjaro, CO2, etc.
These revelations about soot are from none other than V. Ramanathan (well renown research, head of INDOEX effort) and Jim Hansen.
I'm circumspect about the motives behind all this global fear-mongering ... if the ends justify the means, then the raft of lying about global warming suggests some very big goals promoted by the neo-liberal globalist elites that're unrelated to global warming.
When the people of this world realize that there is nothing that can really be done about global warming, a cosmic impact, solar cycles, or another ice age, the better off we will all be.
So take a prozac, crack open a beer or soda, grab your fishing pole and chill.
Things in this world come and go in cycles, and the other things we can't stop anyway.
So save the whales because that is a good thing that we can control.
Stop cutting down the rainforest because that is good as well, and save the polar bears in the process.
On a positive or negative note, depending on your perspective.
I am tired of the snow and ice this winter, I want my global warming back.........
“Anthony Watts compiled the results of all the sources.
The total amount of cooling ranges from 0.65C up to 0.75C — a value large enough to erase nearly all the global warming recorded over the past 100 years.
All in one year time.
For all sources, it’s the single fastest temperature change ever recorded, either up or down.”
I wish to state for the record, that this statement is not mine: “–a value large enough to erase nearly all the global warming recorded over the past 100 years”
This from the source of the graphs you used in the posting about colder temps and snow fall but I didn't the correction anywhere.
You, like most deniers of climate change have cherry picked the data that fits your needs and ignore all the facts.
This is not science, it's called lying to further your ideas or personal agenda.
We are not fooled.
I've been a geologist for over 30 years and have never experienced more of a mockery than the so-called 'science' surrounding the global warming issue.
It's disturbing to have scientific methodology hijacked as a tool 'to prove' that evidence fits a model.
Global warming due to greenouse gasses.
Who knows?
Most of the cultists couldn't draw a carbon-based molecule and certainly couldn't explain it's properties and the variables that make up the tenuous relationship between that molecule and increased temperatures.
Global warming cultists are akin to Creationists grasping at straws 'to prove' a position rather than any adherence to scientific methodology.
Whatever happened to acid rain?
Did we solve that problem which allows us to move on to global warming?
Or could it have been another hoax?
If I had to sit through all those damn film strips in grade school about acid rain and we aren't worrying about it anymore, I want those hours of my life back.
I know I'm new to this page, well really this particular site as a whole, but I have spent the past few days periodically viewing the posts here and on some other blog pages as well, but the thing that gets me is that people, scientist, politicians, etc, along with college students like myself all seem to bring up valid points concerning the weather our planet has recently and historically witnessed.
That being said (and I apologize for the long drawn out sentences) I still constantly hear about this global "consensus" that just cannot exist; there is just too much data from every field flying around in a crazy flurry by people who have taken their view of the world and are playing it as an unquestionable dogma.
And their supposed to be talking about science?
How can there be a consensus on a topic that, until the past 100-150 years, we really couldn't even start gathering all of this data for, especially in regards to recent solar data (which in my opinion is extremely interesting and powerful).
To think we have, in just one century, figured out all there is to know about a planet that has been around for billions of year (or if your church affiliated thousands) is to know that we are wrong.
If science has taught us anything, it's that even if there is just one person (Galileo, Copernicus, Plato, Newton, so on) just one person with the gall to sit their rear end down, analyzing, producing and effectively reproducing charts and graphs that encompass the entirety of the situation and if that one person can sit down and PROVE beyond an inkling of a doubt the exact cause, or in this case causes (because yes each has an effect, each) whether solar, anthropogenic, natural, galactic, glacial, etc, that by doing this with an absolutely un-biased view point, an entire world can be turned on its head.
The inconvenient truth, and the real swindle here is that neither side knows beyond a reasonable doubt exactly how each of these factors work hand in hand in producing the climate that we have today, much less what we will have in any time of the future.
It never matters how many people say something is true, the only thing that matters is that there is one "fool" open minded enough to see past the politics to find the real answer.
That is true knowledge and that is true science.
The moment science is mixed with politics, true science dies and this other breed takes it's place.
There are scientists out there who do their research out of love for their field of work, and who aren't politically tainted, why aren't we getting more information about these climate affecting possibilities from scientists in each individual field, who are self funded and don't have any bit of money flowing into their pockets and research from oil companies, political parties, or special interest groups?
Forgive me for being a little off topic (meaning not specifically about the article above), but I'm hoping some of you knowledgeable non-global warming bandwagon beaters can help me.
Our youngest son was assigned a project in school that is pro-global warming.
My son told the teacher that he didn't believe in GW, and didn't wish to do a project promoting the theory.
Given the reaction of his teacher, you'd have thought he'd announced he was a terrorist.
Still, he asked if he could do a paper against global warming and after some consideration, she said he could.
I'm proud of my son for standing up for himself and want to help him be able to give facts to support his position.
The problem we have is that much of the anti-global warming info we have found is very scientific and above a 10 year old child.
Frankly, I have trouble understanding some of the information to him myself.
Might any of you know of books and/or websites that give solid anti-global warming information that kids can understand?
Or at least, information that adults of a non-scientific bent can understand and then explain to kids?
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
If particulate matter in the air leads to global warming why do we spray metals to combat it?
I understand that humans have to decrease real pollution like sulfur, freon, and so on, but talking about CO2 level are really face.
First of all, animals including us are the biggest producers of CO2 (or should we stop breathing.
)
And you don't have to be a scientist to know that nature controls CO2 level very well => the more we have CO2 the more plants,trees and all green livings use CO2 for growing, because they need CO2 and they break that to C what they use for building them and they pass O2 back to the atmosphere ( so CO2 is totally recyclable in nature) but we should stop destroying forests, because they are earths lungs.
The temperature has always gone up and down, and we actually have had less than 100 years reliable instruments and statistics to compare global temperatures (note we have had instruments in use earlier in very small limited areas, and using those values are not reliable enough for providing global statistics.
A rough analogy: you can drown in a pool of water that averages 1/4 inch deep... You can freeze to death in a climate with an average daily temperature of 72°F (20°C), and similarly for sea-level changes over the centuries.
Therefore, to the extent that our CO2- and soot-emitting civilization is CONTRIBUTING to the warming (look at glacial ice packs and boundaries for the last 100 years), we should find our points of agreement and go forward from there.

Global Warming, and all it's about, is pretty much false.
Me owning a blender, or a car, is not going to send the world spiraling into an inferno.
If people want to prove global warming is true, then find me proof.
I have not seen anything that could actually mean it's right.
All of what I've seen are theories.
During the Medieval times, there was a higher spike of temperature then what we've had.
Now, all the "Global Warming" has been virtually wiped out in a year.
When my father was in school they said, that in 30 years, the world would have gone apocalyptic, and it would be a desert.
That was 30 years ago.
I'm only 15, and I can see the lies that are told.
Al Gore's little Doom prediction?
Rush Limbaugh made the clock to count it down.
When that timer runs out, if we AREN'T dead, then it just proves my point more.
If anyone REALLY wants to think about why it got warmer, why don't they look at all the hot air escaping from al gore.
Rest assured that the heads of all the oil companies got together and figured out that they could profit more in a cold earth than in a warm earth (heating oil sales, natural gas sales for furnaces, etc).
They were responsible for yesterday's global warming and they are responsible for today's global cooling.
You can't prove I'm not right so it must be true!
When, Mr. Gore, are you going to apologize to people for claiming that 'the debate is over' on 'global warming.
' Oh, I forgot, you NEVER let FACTS get in the way of your screeching alarmnism.
Oh, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences should probably apologize too, for giving Gore's fictitious propaganda piece 'An Inconvenient Truth,' (which Gore himself admits contains conjecture, exaggeration, and theory) an OSCAR.
What a joke.
I only hope our government gets their heads out of their as**s before this nonsense kills our economy.
Third global warming is not an exact science.
Not much is.
As a chemist I know there are more things we do not know about chemistry than we do know.
However variations in data regressions does not completely debunk my work or any science.
Trends are becoming abundantly clear.
CO2 levels are above any historical averages, and the temperature is increasing.
Those are FACTS , they are not disputable.
Whether they directly correlate to one another is what the scientists are doing.
So unless you can understand statistics, and interpret raw data yourself, please refrain from debunking a science when you know nothing about science.
No.
Atmospheric CO2 levels stand at present at about 380ppm.
In the earth's past, they have varied from just above 200ppm to over 3,000 ppm.
The point is that, on a geologic time scale, atmospheric CO2 isn't high.
It's actually very low.
And the paleoclimatic record also reveals a very poor correlation between CO2 and temperature, meaning higher levels don't automatically equate with a warming trend.
Recent research has shown that past estimates of CO2's forcing abilities were far overstated.
Even a doubling of atmospheric CO2 is anticipated to generate only some 1 degree of total warming.
Given we've already experienced over half that warming already (barring the last year's cooling pulse, of course), there certainly doesn't seem to be any reason to scream the sky is falling.
The fact remains that since the Earth and life on Earth look more or less like we know it now (< 500,000 years), the CO2 has not exceeded 300 ppm.
To reach the 3,000 ppm you were talking about, I guess you have to go back > 150 My for the best estimate (accounting for the most favorable error bars) to > 300 My.
That's a radically different climate pattern we're talking about!
Here's a fact, earth's climate is always changing, that's just what it does.
Always has and always will.
In my opinion, theories of man made global warming will prove to be one of these discredited theories.
But Al and his crew will continue to cling to it becuase they love the bling and props.
Your right, let's not learn from history, climate starts today.
It fits the models better.
Not always.
In at least one instance (the Late Ordovician Ice Age), CO2 levels were up to 15X higher than they are today -- some 4500 ppm.
And yet the planet was locked in one of the worst ice ages it's ever seen.
Your graph is taken from a 1999 paper on Vostok ice cores.
Higher resolution data subsequent to this has shown that temperatures are indeed correlated to CO2...but in reverse.
The temperatures begin rising before the CO2 dos, up to 1,500 years earlier in some cases.
CO2 levels were up to 15X higher than they are today -- some 4500 ppm.
And yet the planet was locked in one of the worst ice ages it's ever seen.
Again: human activities have increased the concentration of atmospheric CO2 by 100 ppm or 36 percent.
but they are perceived to account for most of the observed accumulated CO2 in the atmosphere.
Most of the naturally emitted CO2 does not accumulate in the atmosphere (it's absorbed for the most part), hence natural variation are roughly between 180 and 280 ppm.
We are today at ~380 ppm after decades of accumulation of anthropogenic input.
They discover and record the historical CO2 levels from ice cores.
Gore and pals claim that if the CO2 levels double the temperature will increase enough to melt the ice caps...
Yet there is still ice for us to get cores from that show that the CO2 levels were 10 times what they are now.
Now if you really want to understand my point, usually you want to learn about the effect of a perturbation of a system by keeping all the rest being roughly equal.
With the Earth it is not that easy, but coming back 500,000 years ago is a reasonable time scale from a climate and a geology point of view (not even mentioning the issue having a biosphere representative of anything close to what we know).
Coming back hundreds of millions of years ago, when CO2 concentration was considerably higher, is probably a great subject of research, but you will have the greatest difficulties to link your results to the present situation.
That is obvious when you consider that for example parts of Africa were at the South pole and atmospheric and oceanic circulation were largely different from what occurs with the present conformation of land masses.
Now if you would have a bit of knowledge about climatology, you'd already realize that drawing conclusion about today's and tomorrow's climate from such old paleoclimate is necessarily limited, especially regarding the major question of feedbacks.
Following your argument, one could analyze the Earth original atmospheres, full of hydrogen an helium, or later (until ~ 200 Myears ago by the way) with large concentration of CO2, little O2 and a very simple biosphere.
I'm not sure were you're going with that, but probably not further than any climatologist ...
I know that a diagram (Mann's discredited "hockey stick") that wipes out a three-hundred year historical reality, the Medieval Warming Period, is patently fraudulent.
I know that when I see a goofball described as a "leading climatologist" spouting the insane proposition that the infancy of industrialization is what ended the Little Ice Age, I am watching a political hack with zero credibility.
I know that when a petition supporting global warming is presented with 4000 names and half of those names are not scientists, that science had little or nothing to do with it.
And I know that when the gears start switching to "Climate Change" instead of "Global Warming," the wheels are coming off the bus.
IOW, their old computer models WERE WRONG.
They didn't have EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE to back up THEIR THEORIES, and NOW their climate models have been demonstrated to be BROKEN.
> is what ended the Little Ice Age, I am watching
You are correct, I am a chemist not an English major.
Also correct in saying that politicizing science is bad.
It is done from both the right and the left, and I will gladly call out the doom and gloom people as well.
The world is not going to be ending just because a few politicians say so.
So I should add both sides of the argument are full of it.
The data is weak, and a few spikes in CO2 levels ice core samples when volcanic activity was up, and CO2 were of natural causes.
I may add these coincide with periods of high plant growth The earth works as a buffer, and when we move beyond its ability to regulate itself it will let us know.
The forests and oceans can only hold so much... Do we need to stop using fossil fuels immediately, no do we need to listen to Al Gore?
I don't know never saw his movie because I didn't want to see the propaganda... Do we need to have a logical look without cherry picking data.
Yes
Snowstorms in southern China?
Puh-lease, these are the same people who usually deny more frequent hurricanes having anything to do with warmer temperatures.
Come on, massive weather systems like hurricanes have a lot more to do with the climate than whether there's a downpour or a snowstorm.
It's no surprise there's no mention of the normal, if not slightly warmer winter weather in Europe.
But the ice cover in the arctic ocean is also skipped.
It's diminishing like it has been for the last 30+ years.
Your "facts" are simply nonsense (and simply non-science).
You talk of statistics, so you'll be familiar with this statement: garbage in, garbage out.
Which is why the dogma of global warming has never worked when actually applied to and observed in the real world (a necessary part of any working theory, but what's a little invalidation between friends?
).
Thus we see the sudden need to change the label from "global warming" (which only works when a given level of solar output dictates warming -- oh, did I say such a blasphemy out loud?
sorry! my bad) to the much more user-friendly "climate change.
" That certainly covers all the bases, doesn't it?
(Though in our politically correct times, wouldn't "global temperature stabilization challenged" be even better?
But I digress...)
Which means that people -- meaning those who subscribe to the climate change religion (and make no mistake, it IS a religion in the very worse sense, with unquestioning and unquestionable dogma, calls for inquisitions against we heretics, etc.
) -- can assign blame to mankind for ANY change in the weather, and (most importantly) the underlying political agenda can proceed unhindered.
Most of the counter arguments to the precepts of the gospel of climate change have already been covered in the various threads here, but in my quick glance through I didn't see one point that I like to make from a geologist's standpoint: warmer is BETTER.
(The article itself alludes to this.
)
When the world has been warmer, it hasn't turned in the equivalent of DUNE (a good read, but unfortunately the bible, it seems, of climate changers).
In fact a warmer world (and I mean even A LOT warmer) is a greener, wetter, milder, in a word, NICER world for we hairless primates.
If "greenhouse gasses" actually warmed the planet, I'd be for burning them in much larger quantities than we do at the moment.
(By the way, I keep wondering how man-generated atmospheric pollutants raised the temperature of other planets in the solar system, but again I digress...)
Here's just the facts, ma'am: If the world is truly entering a cooling phase, we're in for a tough go.
The result will be a harsher, more barren world, where a large percentage of the life on this planet (yes, even those wonderful fuzzy fellow travelers we love to protect) is going to struggle.
Yes, even climate change religionists are going to witness and be part of some dark times, and we can only hope we'll have enough of BOTH carbon based and alternative fuels to get us through.
And just so we're clear: getting rid of humanity's carbon footprint is not going to do even the smallest thing to stop ANY form of "climate change" (pick from the following options: a) warming, b) cooling, c) neither warming or colling, d) both warming and cooling, e) all of the above).
We do not know what the true tempetures were prior to the mini ice age, during the Roman Empire, or even during 1000AD.
So when I hear people screaming that we are all going to die from the warming trend I ask you to prove to me that the tempeture fluctuation is not part of the planetay cycle.
There are things that are being used now to give us ideas of what the temperature was like 1000's of years ago.
They have taken samples from ice cores and stalagmites and can get very accurate details that climate change has been occuring for millions of years.
Even climate warming.
This crap about we are causing our planet to warm are bs.
The History channel had a great show on called "How the Earth was Made" If anyone can watch this and then still have the conclusion that human actions have any effect on this planets climate, I would love to here the argument.
My favorite comeback to the global warming hysteria is the question, What human activity caused the Ice Age and what human activety brought the planet out of it?
Funny how many blank looks you get.
Human migrations to good ole USA (present-day USA) ended the Ice Age.
The year 1816 was famous as "the year without a summer.
" That year started out, in Stanley as well as other regions of the south, so mild for the months of January and February that many folks let their fires go out and burned wood only for cooking; however, March was very cold and windy.
Showers started the Month of April but ended with snow and ice.
In May the temperature was like that of winter.
The young buds that began forming in April were stiff and frozen.
Ice, one half inch thick formed on ponds and rivers in North and South Carolina.
Corn was killed and after being planted again and again nothing was reaped from the cornfields.
June was cold, the coldest month ever experienced in this latitude.
Almost all green things as well as fruits were killed.
There was ice, frost, and some snow flurries in July.
August proved to be the worst month of all not only here but even in Europe.
September started out with two weeks of pleasant weather and the rest of the month was cold.
October and November were extremely cold and then December was mild.
This extraordinary weather condition in 1816 had been caused by the volcanic eruption of Mt.
Temboro in the Dutch East Indies, blowing 50 cubic miles of dust into the air and killing some 66,000 people.
The volcanic dust clouded the skies all over the earth causing doom and gloom and the "year without a summer.
"
I think not.
Volcanoes put more CFC's into the atmosphere every day than all of mankind has already done.
But I agree with you.
Volcanoes dump a lot of crap into the atmosphere, have for millions of years.
Thank you volcanoes!
!
I wonder how much this undersea volcano eruption (22 million cubic meters) raised sea levels / temperatures... causing more polar ice melting and killing mass quantities of krill, kelp, and other CO2 converting plant life?
When the law of our land (Supreme Court) confirms CO2 is a pollutant, and this religion-come-science blooms in all its pathologic glory, how many generations will it take to conclude that in order to get rid of the pollutant, we have to get rid of the polluters: People.
Our problem isn't burning oil, it's running out of oil.
The only way to solve that is growth, investment, invention, human ingenuity.
That leads to cleaner technologies, less poverty, longer life, more opportunities for the human spirit.
Global warming as a movement is about the opposite: restricting growth, suffocating progress, investing in whether Polar Bears are humping or not, and limiting human potential.
So if you call Liberalism "madness" then you must also consider the humane fact that it is an inherited "defect".
But why might such a "defect" not then be weeded out?
Well, political activism is a great way for males to get female attention, and for females to get invited to high society parties full of high status wealthy males.
The research, published in the January issue of Climatic Change, found that the coldest daily temperatures recorded in Bozeman, Mont., and Coldstream, British Columbia, have occurred less often over the past several decades.
Extreme cold nighttime temperatures have become less frequent, and extreme warm nighttime temperatures have become more frequent at a rate of about one percent per year or 10 percent per decade.
The greatest warming occurred during late February to March and late July to August.
The research sites are 500 miles apart and on opposite sides of the Continental Divide, but their climate changes tend to be remarkably similar, said Joseph Caprio, professor emeritus and former Montana State Climatologist in MSU's Department of Land Resources and Environmental Sciences and lead author of the "Climatic Change" paper.
The discoveries may interest scientists who study Glacier National Park, because the park lies halfway between the two sites, Caprio added.
The findings also lend support to prior research.
Caprio retired from MSU in 1993, then became a visiting scientist at Canada's Pacific Agriculture and Agri-Food Research Centre in the Okanagan Valley where Coldstream is located.
Harvey Quamme, one of his collaborators, is with the Agriculture and Agri-Food Research Centre in Summerland, British Columbia.
The other collaborator , Gallatin Valley native Kelly Redmond, works at the Atmospheric Sciences Division, Western Regional Climate Center of the Desert Research Institute in Reno, Nev.
To analyze the temperature changes, the scientists used a statistical procedure called the "iterative chi-square method.
" Caprio originally developed the technique to understand the effect of daily weather on winter wheat and rangeland production in Montana.
He later applied the method to study the effect of daily weather on apple, grape, apricot, peach and sweet cherry production in the Okanagan Valley.
He also used it in the Laboratory of Tree Ring Research at the University of Arizona to determine how daily temperature and precipitation affected the annual width of tree rings.
The iterative chi-square method is different from some other techniques for studying climate change because it uses daily temperatures, Caprio said.
Scientists can use the procedure to discover daily and weekly significance in addition to monthly and annual trends.
Dan Fagre, a research ecologist based in Glacier National Park, said he looked forward to reading Caprio's paper.
The park once had 150 glaciers, but it now has 25 and scientists are predicting that all will be gone by 2030.
Eighty-four percent of the ice and perennial snow fields in the park have disappeared.
Fagre noted that a glacier is ice that covers at least 25 acres.

High prices at the pump are taking cars off the road and reducing air pollution.
The decrease in travel nationwide is equivalent to removing 1.3 million cars from the road for a year and 7.1 million tons of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, from the air.
That's about the same amount of carbon dioxide a large coal-fired power plant spews into the air every year.
Charles Tiebout's suggestion that people "vote with their feet" for communities with optimal bundles of taxes and public goods has played a central role in local public finance for over 50 years.
Using a locational equilibrium model, we derive formal tests of his premise.
The model predicts increased population density in neighborhoods experiencing exogenous improvements in public goods and, for large improvements, increased relative mean incomes.
We test these hypotheses in the context of changing air quality.
Our results provide strong empirical support for the notion that households "vote with their feet" for environmental quality.
Despite concerns over air pollution and global warming caused by coal plants, TVA expects to continue to stoke coal in most of its major power plants for decades to come.
Although TVA has no plans to build any more coal-fired plants, none of the 59 coal-fired units now in operation are scheduled to be shut down for at least another 15 years.
TVA spends nearly $1 million a day on pollution controls, but the federal utility still faces at least a half dozen lawsuits and violation notices over emissions from coal plants.
North Carolina’s attorney general has called TVA “a public nuisance” for polluting the Tar Heel state, while some environmentalists want TVA to quit burning coal altogether to limit greenhouse gases they contend cause global warming.
(3/27/08) On March 25, 2008, EPA held the acid rain auction giving private citizens, brokers and power plants the opportunity to buy and sell sulfur dioxide (SO2) allowances, as part of the cap and trade program to reduce acid rain.
When fully implemented in 2010, the Acid Rain Program will have cut SO2 emissions by 50 percent from 1990 levels.
...
The auction includes two types of allowances: 125,000 offered for use in 2008 and 125,000 additional allowances offered seven years in advance to help provide stability in planning for capital investments.
These advance allowances will be available for use in 2015.
The number of allowances a source purchases will not permit them to emit SO2 at a level that would violate the health-based national ambient air quality standard.
The weighted average of winning bids for 2008 is $389.91.
32 of the 125,000 bids in the spot market were purchased by various groups (e.g., Acid Rain Retirement Fund, Bates College Environmental Economics) for the purposes of taking a ton of SO2 off the market.
World record holder Haile Gebrselassie is almost certain to miss the marathon at the Beijing Olympics because of the city's poor air quality.
So now you are supposed to ask: But, Tim, what is it worth to reduce the incidence of asthma in China due to air pollution?
The downside is a car that would most likely fail emission and safety standards on any Western road, and, perhaps, in India in a few years, when the country imposes tougher environmental standards.
This mass shift of polluting industries has blighted China’s economic rise.
Double-digit growth rates have done less to improve people’s lives when the damages to the air, land, water and human health are considered, some economists say.
Outmoded production equipment will have to be replaced or retrofitted at high cost if the country intends to reduce pollution.
The U.S. Forest Service is warning Virginia environmental officials that pollution from a $1.6 billion coal-fired power plant proposed for Wise County would violate federal clean-air laws.
In a letter to the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, the supervisor of the Pisgah National Forest in North Carolina said the plant proposed by Dominion Virginia Power would pump enough sulfur dioxide into the air to possibly damage plant life and visibility in the 12,000-acre Linville Gorge Wilderness.
... the Environmental Economics blog ... is now the default homepage on my browser (but then again, I guess I am a wonk -- a word I learned on the E.E.

ScienceDaily (Feb. 19, 2009) — By controlling emissions of fossil fuels we may be able to greatly delay the start of the next ice age, new research from the Niels Bohr Institute at University of Copenhagen concludes.
From an Earth history perspective, we are living in cold times.
The greatest climate challenge mankind has faced has been surviving ice ages that have dominated climate during the past million years.
Therefore it is not surprising that back in the relatively cold 1970's prominent scientists like Soviet Union climatologist Mikhail Budyko greeted man-made global warming from CO
emissions as a way to keep us out of future ice ages.
And there are still those around who feel that continued high fossil fuel emissions are good for this reason.
But is the extreme global warming that would result from this a reasonable, and indeed necessary, price to pay to keep ice ages at bay?
Ice ages start when conditions at high northern latitudes allow winter snowfall to persist over the summer for enough years to accumulate and build ice sheets.
Such conditions depend mainly on summer solar radiation there and atmospheric CO
concentration.
This radiation is modulated on time scales of 20.000, 40.000 and 100.000 years by changes in the Earth's orbit and orientation.
Critical summer solar radiation for initiating ice sheet growth can be significantly lower for higher atmospheric CO
Professor Shaffer made long projections over the next 500,000 years with the DCESS Earth System Model to calculate the evolution of atmospheric CO
for different fossil fuel emission strategies.
He also used results of a coupled climate-ice sheet model for the dependency on atmospheric CO
of critical summer solar radiation at high northern latitudes for an ice age onset.
The results show global warming of almost 5 degrees Celsius above present for a "business as usual" scenario whereby all 5000 billion tons of fossil fuel carbon in accessible reserves are burned within the next few centuries.
In this scenario the onset of next ice age was postponed to about 170,000 years from now.
However, for a management scenario whereby fossil fuel use was reduced globally by 20% in 2020 and 60% in 2050 (compared to 1990 levels), maximum global warming was less than one degree Celsius above present.
Similar reductions in fossil fuel use have been proposed by various countries like Germany and Great Britain.
In this scenario, combustion pulses of large remaining fossil fuel reserves were then tailored to raise atmospheric CO
content high and long enough to parry forcing of ice age onsets by summer radiation minima as long as possible.
In this way our present equable interglacial climate was extended for about 500,000 years, three times as long as in the "business as usual" case.
"It appears to be well established that the strong ice ages the Earth has experienced over the past million years were ushered in by declining levels of atmospheric CO
level of about 385 parts per million is already higher than before the transition to these ice ages" Professor Shaffer notes and adds that "The Earth's orbit is nearly circular at present meaning that the present minimum in summer radiation at high northern latitudes is not very deep.
We have already increased atmospheric CO
enough to keep us out of the next ice age for at least the next 55,000 years for this orbital setup".
He concludes that "Fossil fuel reserves may be too valuable for regulating climate far into the future to allow the reserves to be consumed within the next few centuries.
The price of extreme global warming to avoid ice ages is a high and indeed unnecessary price to pay.
"
The picture shows the maximum ice distribution on the northern hemisphere during the last ice age.
By controlling emissions of fossil fuels we may be able to delay the start of the next ice age for 500,000 years, new research shows.

His company, London-based Climate Exchange PLC, has carved out a key role in Europe's booming trade in "carbon permits" -- essentially, buying and selling the right to pollute.
Since 2005, the European Union has required major polluters to either cut the amount of carbon dioxide they spew, or buy pollution credits in the open market.
A big chunk of the action occurs on an exchange founded by Mr. Sandor, a one-time Berkeley professor who has morphed into a gregarious climate-change entrepreneur.
He's among the most successful investors trying to profit from rising environmental awareness, whether by speculating in energy commodities or launching wind-power companies.
Last year, the total value of carbon permits changing hands -- whether on public exchanges or in private, off-market transactions, where most still occur -- nearly doubled to €40 billion, or about $60 billion, according to Oslo-based Point Carbon, a market research firm.
Yesterday, Climate Exchange's stock jumped 16% after the firm reported a tripling in 2007 revenue to £13.6 million, or about $27 million.
That gives the company, which handles about 90% of the trading on carbon exchanges, a market capitalization of roughly $1.31 billion.
Mr. Sandor's 20% stake is worth more than $260 million on paper.
It's an unusual mix of markets theory and environmentalism.
"The right wing always suspects you of being a tree-hugging environmentalist and the left wing accuses you of being a money-grubbing capitalist," says Mr. Sandor, who back in the 1990s developed a markets-based system to cut down on pollutants causing acid rain.
The next big battlefield will be in the U.S., where Congress is currently debating setting up a system for regulating greenhouse-gas emissions.
Lawmakers are considering a system like the one created by the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, a global United Nations-sponsored accord that set emissions-cutting targets for the 175 nations that ratified it.
Europe's program was an early test run of the Kyoto Protocol, whose emission restrictions began hitting industry this year.
The U.S. hasn't ratified Kyoto.
But all three leading Democratic and Republican presidential candidates say they want the U.S. to do more to fight climate change, and would likely set up a carbon-trading program.
Carbon permits are traded much like physical commodities -- gold, oil or pork bellies.
Each government-issued permit grants its holder permission to emit a ton of carbon dioxide into the air.
Carbon Exchange makes money by taking a commission on each trade and by charging membership fees.
So-called "cap and trade" programs like Europe's are intended to give polluters a financial incentive to clean up their act.
Governments set emissions caps, and companies that beat them can trade their pollution credits to other firms willing to pay to pollute.
Over time, the caps are lowered, making it costlier to choose to keep polluting.
Some economists argue for taxing polluters instead, including Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, and former chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, Gregory Mankiw.
A carbon tax, they say, would be more transparent and less vulnerable to lobbying by industries trying to win higher caps for themselves.
Robert Stavins, an environmental economist at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government, agrees Europe's carbon market isn't perfect, but defends the role of financiers.
"The only way we can fight climate change is if there is an opportunity for businesses and individuals to make a fortune off of it," he said.
Trading in greenhouse-gas emission credits more than tripled in volume in 2006.
Exchanges established under the European Union's emissions trading scheme represent nearly two-thirds of the global trading volume.
The New South Wales Greenhouse Gas Abatement Scheme and the Chicago Climate Exchange, for buyers who voluntarily want to greenhouse gases, also saw trading volumes increase in 2006.
He first envisioned a carbon market long before many people had heard of global warming.
In 1992 at the United Nations Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, he presented an academic paper on how markets might be used to reduce carbon emissions.
Of the conference, Mr. Sandor recalls: "There was more tie-dye there than at a Grateful Dead concert.
It felt like a movement.
" Indeed, the event laid the groundwork for what eventually became the 1997 Kyoto Protocol.
In the late 1990s he finally got his chance -- or so he thought.
At that time, countries around the world started signing on to the Kyoto Protocol.
He assumed the U.S. would sign on, too, so he founded the Chicago Climate Exchange in anticipation of a U.S. carbon-trading boom.
However, soon after taking office, the Bush administration declined to ratify Kyoto, arguing it would hurt U.S. companies' competitiveness because developing countries like China and India weren't required to curb emissions.
But rather than dumping it, he decided to convert the Chicago Climate Exchange into a system that companies could join to voluntarily reduce their emissions.
By 2003, he teamed up with a friend in London, insurance executive Neil Eckert, to take everything learned in the U.S. experiment and apply it in Europe, which was then just gearing up its own trading system.
So they set up a separate carbon-trading market in London, the European Climate Exchange.
Mr. Eckert later became its chief executive, a position he holds today.
Mr. Sandor had an ace up his sleeve: He sat on the board of IntercontinentalExchange, or ICE, which operates Europe's leading energy exchange, trading oil, gas and electricity.
ICE agreed to host Mr. Sandor's new European Climate Exchange on its system as part of an undisclosed revenue-sharing agreement.
That deal was an important part of Climate Exchange's success at beating rival markets: The ICE affiliation instantly put his exchange in front of Europe's commodity traders.
A 2008 permit entitling the bearer to emit one ton of carbon dioxide is currently trading just under €22, up from €17 or so a year earlier.
At the end of each year, regulated companies must hold permits representing their total emissions over that period.
A fairly typical coal-fired power plant might emit anywhere from five million to 15 million tons of carbon dioxide a year, depending on its size and other variables.
BEYOND THE IVORY TOWER: The Scientific Consensus on Climate Change
Policy-makers and the media, particularly in the United States, frequently assert that climate science is highly uncertain.
Some have used this as an argument against adopting strong measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
For example, while discussing a major U.S. Environmental Protection Agency report on the risks of climate change, then-EPA administrator Christine Whitman argued, "As [the report] went through review, there was less consensus on the science and conclusions on climate change" (1).
Some corporations whose revenues might be adversely affected by controls on carbon dioxide emissions have also alleged major uncertainties in the science (2).
Such statements suggest that there might be substantive disagreement in the scientific community about the reality of anthropogenic climate change.
This is not the case.
The scientific consensus is clearly expressed in the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
Created in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environmental Programme, IPCC's purpose is to evaluate the state of climate science as a basis for informed policy action, primarily on the basis of peer-reviewed and published scientific literature (3).
In its most recent assessment, IPCC states unequivocally that the consensus of scientific opinion is that Earth's climate is being affected by human activities:
"Human activities ... are modifying the concentration of atmospheric
IPCC is not alone in its conclusions.
In recent years, all major scientific bodies in the United States whose members' expertise bears directly on the matter have issued similar statements.
For example, the National Academy of Sciences report, Climate Change Science: An Analysis of Some Key Questions, begins: "Greenhouse gases are accumulating in Earth's atmosphere as a result of human activities, causing surface air temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures to rise" [p. 1 in (5)].
The report explicitly asks whether the IPCC assessment is a fair summary of professional scientific thinking, and answers yes: "The IPCC's conclusion that most of the observed warming of the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations accurately reflects the current thinking of the scientific community on this issue" [p. 3 in (5)].
Others agree.
The American Meteorological Society (6), the American Geophysical Union (7), and the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) all have issued statements in recent years concluding that the evidence for human modification of climate is compelling (8).
The drafting of such reports and statements involves many opportunities for comment, criticism, and revision, and it is not likely that they would diverge greatly from the opinions of the societies' members.
Nevertheless, they might downplay legitimate dissenting opinions.
That hypothesis was tested by analyzing 928 abstracts, published in refereed scientific journals between 1993 and 2003, and listed in the ISI database with the keywords "climate change" (9).
The 928 papers were divided into six categories: explicit endorsement of the consensus position, evaluation of impacts, mitigation proposals, methods, paleoclimate analysis, and rejection of the consensus position.
Of all the papers, 75% fell into the first three categories, either explicitly or implicitly accepting the consensus view; 25% dealt with methods or paleoclimate, taking no position on current anthropogenic climate change.
Remarkably, none of the papers disagreed with the consensus position.
Admittedly, authors evaluating impacts, developing methods, or studying paleoclimatic change might believe that current climate change is natural.
However, none of these papers argued that point.
This analysis shows that scientists publishing in the peer-reviewed literature agree with IPCC, the National Academy of Sciences, and the public statements of their professional societies.
Politicians, economists, journalists, and others may have the impression of confusion, disagreement, or discord among climate scientists, but that impression is incorrect.
The scientific consensus might, of course, be wrong.
If the history of science teaches anything, it is humility, and no one can be faulted for failing to act on what is not known.
But our grandchildren will surely blame us if they find that we understood the reality of anthropogenic climate change and failed to do anything about it.
Many details about climate interactions are not well understood, and there are ample grounds for continued research to provide a better basis for understanding climate dynamics.
The question of what to do about climate change is also still open.
But there is a scientific consensus on the reality of anthropogenic climate change.
Climate scientists have repeatedly tried to make this clear.
It is time for the rest of us to listen.
National Academy of Sciences Committee on the Science of Climate Change, Climate Change Science: An Analysis of Some Key Questions (National Academy Press, Washington, DC, 2001).
The first year for which the database consistently published abstracts was 1993.
Some abstracts were deleted from our analysis because, although the authors had put "climate change" in their key words, the paper was not about climate change.
But what about nuclear when capital from investors is at stake?
“Nuclear power is continuing its decades-long collapse in the global marketplace because it’s grossly uncompetitive, unneeded, and obsolete.” (See more at Rocky Mountain Institute’s “ Nuclear Power: Climate Fix or Folly?
“)
Meanwhile, across the pond, the new British coalition government , may have, by its appointment of Liberal Democrat Chris Huhne as minister for Energy and Climate Change, sounded the death knell for new nuclear power.
Nuclear will not get atom of help from this Government reads the headline from “The Times.” Citigroup reported last November, for Britain, The Economics Say No - without massive amounts of public money.
With as Homeric a public debt as Greece, the UK is not about to sink billions of pounds into the black hole of new nuclear.
Here are a few more nails for the coffin.
Environmental impact : Indian Point, on the Hudson River, accounts for the deaths of about a billion fish a year.
Inadequacy of water supply : During the devastating European heat wave in the summer of 2003, France, Spain and Germany were forced to shut down numerous nuclear plants and reduce the power output of others because of low water supplies.
Reliability: Nuclear power’s much-vaunted reliability comes up against some stark numbers.
Lovins - perhaps not surprisingly - again: “A broader assessment of reliability tends not to favor nuclear power.
Of all 132 U.S. nuclear plants built-just over half of the 253 originally ordered-21% were permanently and prematurely closed due to reliability or cost problems.
Another 27% have completely failed for a year or more at least once.”
I’ve found nuclear power wanting for nearly 40 years.
I read John Gofman and Arthur Tamplin’s superb Poisoned Power when it first came out.
If there has been any argument that might mitigate the manifest evils of nuclear power in all these decades it is that the climate crisis requires us to produce low-carbon energy.
But, as we’ve seen, that is a Big Lie.
It is very clear indeed that further pursuit of the “nuclear option” will in fact take us closer, and more quickly, to climate catastrophe.
Here is an article from the consistently excellent website and news resource, Solve Climate, that talks about further progress that EPA is making on confronting this environmental obscenity.
The EPA’s regional administrator has just issued a “proposed” determination on an individual application.
(It’s “proposed” because it’s not final until there is considerable public comment and response by EPA.
We call that democracy.
) Shawn Garvin, the regional administrator, wrote: “EPA believes that the predicted impacts from the Spruce No.
1 mine, if constructed as currently authorized, could have unacceptable effects on wildlife and fisheries.” Unacceptable.
That’s a big word in these sorts of proceedings.
I noted here a year ago that Lisa Jackson, EPA’s boss, “…planned an aggressive review of permit requests for mountaintop coal mining, citing concerns about potential harm to water quality.” She’s kept her word.
Update: EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson on Thursday announced “ Comprehensive Guidance to Protect Appalachian Communities From Harmful Environmental Impacts of Mountaintop Mining .” Jackson said: “One point I have emphasized is EPA’s responsibility under the Clean Water Act - and we are unequivocally committed to fulfilling that responsibility with regard to mountaintop mining.” Jackson is turning out to be one of the strongest EPA chiefs ever.
In one year, she may have already surpassed all the others.
John Kerry gave a speech this past week in which he said that he is “on a short track” to introducing climate and energy legislation that can be passed.
Kerry said he’d been working with key administration officials and Senators to create a package.
In a Reuters article on this, Carol Browner is quoted as saying “…the work that is going on up on the Hill is moving at a nice speed.” Reuters also noted the obvious: “Washington’s ability to produce a domestic law mandating carbon reductions on industry will have a significant impact on whether negotiations on the international track will succeed.”
Kerry is articulate and passionate about climate change.
“Why do you need to price carbon?
Because you need to create a signal in the marketplace where businesses have a certainty about where the marketplace is going over 20, 30, 50 years so they begin to invest accordingly and you begin to move your market in wholesale fashion towards the kind of new investments, new jobs and the adjustments we can make.” That’s why most of the Fortune 500 companies that have a stake in this - either because they’re GHG-emitters or they’re poised to increase their value by investing in clean tech, or both - have been hammering on Congress to get this done.
Will it be cap-and-trade ?
Maybe not, according to the “Washington Post” yesterday: Senators to propose abandoning cap-and-trade .
“Power plants would face an overall cap on emissions that would become more stringent over time; motor fuel may be subject to a carbon tax whose proceeds could help electrify the U.S. transportation sector; and industrial facilities would be exempted from a cap on emissions for several years before it is phased in.
The legislation would also expand domestic oil and gas drilling offshore and would provide federal assistance for constructing nuclear power plants and carbon sequestration and storage projects at coal-fired utilities.” The nuclear power component is a sop to the GOP .
(It’s also, in my opinion, hugely bad policy .
But then some smart analysts, like Dave Roberts at Grist, think nukes are an acceptable price to pay for climate legislation - as they won’t get built at the end of the day.
)
Like John Kerry, Al Gore lost a presidential election to George W. Bush. (What a distinction.
) But also like Kerry, Gore is articulate, passionate and steeped in the science, economics and politics of climate and energy.
He has an op-ed in today’s “NY Times” in which he notes Kerry’s effort and that a draft bill is forthcoming - as soon as next week perhaps.
The op-ed covers a lot of important ground, including addressing the brouhaha over the science .
(Gore’s latest book, Our Choice , does a phenomenal job of looking at and explaining the complexities of climate change and our energy future.
I’ve been using it this semester in both of my climate change classes at NYU.
)
Gore says in his op-ed that the “pathway to success is still open” and “begins with a choice by the United States to pass a law establishing a cost for global warming pollution.” A “price on carbon.” That’s what industry and finance have been calling for, along with the President of the United States, the US House of Representatives, top economists, the European Union, the UNFCCC, the IPCC, top science academies - pretty much the entirety of the community of key policymakers on climate and energy.
Earth to the US Senate : Let’s get on it.
Why should Senator Murkowski pay attention to this?
Because she’s working very hard, with some very special interests, to block the legally constituted, indeed mandated responsibility of the Environmental Protection Agency to protect the public health and the environment.
What is EPA doing that so threatens her and the fossil fuel industries?
They’re proceeding to regulate greenhouse gases.
(See under “endangerment finding” at these posts .
)
Juliet Eilperin and her colleagues at the “Washington Post” have done a little digging and found that Murkowski is working hand-in-glove with two industry lobbyists to scuttle the EPA program.
Thankfully, she faces an uphill battle.
As one environmental operative notes: “Striking at the heart of the Clean Air Act isn’t a popular thing to do.” Even among some Republicans.
The “NY Times” called this Ms. Murkowski’s Mischief in an editorial on Monday saying “Ms.
Murkowski has been considering various proposals related to climate change - all mischievous.”
You would not be surprised to learn that Al Gore is putting his shoulder to the wheel against this move.
His groups, the Alliance for Climate Protection and the Climate Protection Action Fund, have been speaking out against “ Senate efforts to turn the Clean Air Act into the Dirty Air Act .”
With the Senate a major stumbling block on the path to federal climate change legislation, and now storm warnings that this Congressional house, having failed to materially advance legislation in 2009, may not pursue a bill even this year, it becomes all-the-more critical that the EPA do its job and push ahead with a regulatory approach to curbing greenhouse gases.
It’s the right thing to do.
The morning plenary session began with remarks from the Manhattan Borough President, Scott Stringer, one of the sponsors of the summit and a driver of the NYC Sustainable Food Charter , Jacquie Berger from Just Food , and, via video, Wangari Maathai, Nobel Peace laureate and founder of the Green Belt Movement , and Vandana Shiva, director of Navdanya International .
Shiva has a particularly compelling story to tell about Big Agriculture, and how small farmers, working organically, can produce more food, with hugely fewer chemical inputs to the soil and water and much less of a burden of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.
An opening panel was moderated by Anna Lappé, founder of Take a Bite out of Climate Change .
Take a Bite is itself a project of the Small Planet Institute , founded by her and her mother, Frances Moore Lappé, author of the seminal Diet for a Small Planet , a book that came out at about the same time as my old, now-dog-eared standby, The Vegetarian Epicure .
Lappé fille is, not surprisingly, quite articulate on the benefits of reducing animal agriculture’s extraordinarily negative impact.
Don’t think this perception’s not taking hold?
Like the quantum leaps that renewable energy and other clean tech are taking - and I never thought I’d live to see - so too is the recognition that we need to think differently about how we eat and how we produce our food.
This is all well beyond the hippie activist stage too.
I’ve been reading and hearing more and more about agroecology, and climate change superstars like Al Gore, Rajendra Pachauri and Lord Nicholas Stern are talking about reducing meat consumption.
(See these recent posts: Meat , More Meat and Al Gore’s New Book - and Copenhagen .
) Don’t think some special interests aren’t concerned?
See Food Fight: Big Beef Challenges EPA Climate Change Finding from BNET yesterday.
There was more exciting discussion at the workshops .
These brought together some of the top policymakers, wonks, and activists in the fields of urban agriculture, energy and waste management, food and nutrition, economic development, social policy, and other key areas, not just from New York, but throughout the country.
I sat in on a session that got me thinking about how “distributed farming” and “distributed generation” could and should co-exist.
Gore has an excellent discussion of the greenhouse gases, anthropogenically produced, that are wreaking the havoc that concerns us.
What’s so useful and interesting is that he fully discusses all of the six families of pollutants involved.
He presents a graphic that reflects the work of NASA’s Dr. Drew Shindell and his colleagues as presented in an article in “Science” a few weeks ago: Improved Attribution of Climate Forcing to Emissions .
A greater recognition of and concern for methane’s contribution got a lot of the play at the time - see this , for instance, from “The Times” - but there is also more evidence now for the critical role that black carbon plays in warming.
(Shindell has been very involved in furthering the research on BC’s radiative forcing and how effective it could be to radically reduce its contributions.
)
Vice President Al Gore , Nobel Peace Laureate, venture capitalist, author, lecturer, Academy Award winner, activist, the man Denialists love to hate, and the man some others canonize as the path-breaking visionary on the threat of global climate change, has a new book out: Our Choice: A Plan to Solve the Climate Crisis .
It has a series of solutions and it’s a call to action for people all over the world.
Gore is making the rounds to both promote the book and to talk about the looming crossroads at Copenhagen .
The preeminent journalistic voice on climate change, Betsy Kolbert , interviewed Gore at her blog for “The New Yorker.” It’s a wide-ranging conversation and Gore’s optimistic about prospects, both for Copenhagen and beyond.
I had one cavil which I expressed in a comment there: “I’m somewhat at a loss, though, in reading this conversation, to note the absence of reference to greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide.
As we all know, methane, nitrous oxide, the F-gases, ozone and black carbon are all pernicious actors in warming and need to be addressed.” I think they both know this perfectly well, but there seems to be a sense that the issue has to be dumbed down for the general public, a perception that I challenged when Bill McKibben did it last summer in a book review.
In any event, Kolbert, McKibben, and Gore are three of the greatest rainbow warriors of our age and should be regarded as such.
Gore was at the American Museum of Natural History earlier this week and “Scientific American” covered the event .
Gore talked about population, a too-neglected part of the equation in the climate change calculus, and he talked about gender equality.
“Near-zero growth, however, could be attained with four basic societal achievements, he said.
The goals include: the education of girls, the empowerment of women, the spread of fertility management and a higher child survival rate.
Regardless of climate change, he noted, these aims are ‘all things we should be doing for good and beneficial reasons otherwise.’”
The good folks at Salon.com did an interview with him too.
Asked his expectations for Copenhagen, he said: “I think it is realistic to expect a treaty.
It will not be as strong as I would like it to be.
But it will put a price on carbon and change the forward planning of businesses and cities and states, provinces and nations.” Putting a price on carbon is one of the cornerstones of climate policy that the IPCC, the Stern Review, the EU, and most economists in the world concerned about the issue have all trumpeted.
In a happy coincidence, the author of the book I referred to in my post below on Meat , Bloodless Revolution, has a review of Gore’s book in this past weekend’s “FT.” Tristram Stuart’s highly laudatory review is itself very much worth reading.
He notes, among other things, Gore’s embrace of biosequestration as a vital tool in fighting climate change and his disavowal of the massive biofuel development for which he had formerly been an advocate.
(See, for example, my posts on biochar and Are Biofuels a Bummer?
)
The big ticket for today is that President Barack Hussein Obama has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
What’s that got to do with climate change?
The press release from the Norwegian Nobel Committee says that, among his other accomplishments: “Thanks to Obama’s initiative, the USA is now playing a more constructive role in meeting the great climatic challenges the world is confronting.” Clearly the Committee has climate change high on its agenda as it awarded the 2007 prize , as you know, to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and to Al Gore “for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change.”
President Obama’s reaction to the announcement included remarks relative to climate change.
“We cannot accept the growing threat posed by climate change, which could forever damage the world that we pass on to our children — sowing conflict and famine; destroying coastlines and emptying cities.
And that’s why all nations must now accept their share of responsibility for transforming the way that we use energy.” I’ve chronicled many of the groundbreaking initiatives of the Obama Administration at the blog.
The freezing of the North, the warming of the South, and the long-term devastating impacts these had is the underlying premise of one of my vacation reads: Mara and Dann by Doris Lessing.
At the heart of the story are the adventures of a brother and sister seeking to escape the ravages of drought, crime, ignorance and war in almost all of “Ifrik.” It is a convincing look into the teeth of how drought kills the earth, the people on it, and the goodness in them.
You don’t need to read a post-apocalyptic novel from a master storyteller, though, to tell you to pay attention.
The evidence is everywhere that we’re cooking our climate system well past the danger point and we had better get on it - and now.
Paul Krugman excoriates those who voted against it for Betraying the Planet .
I think it’s more like they’re betraying themselves and their constituents, but that’s what regressed large groups - such as the 168 Republicans and 44 Democrats who voted against the bill - do.
Does Joe Barton, for instance, whose district includes Houston, think that the hurricanes that have been blasting up from the Gulf are going to diminish in intensity as the world grows warmer?
Three of the four Mississippi members voted no, as did all seven of the Louisiana reps. Were these folks all on vacation on another planet when Katrina decimated their states?
Mary Bono Mack and seven other Republicans voted yes, but Greg Walden whose district in Oregon has forests that are disappearing from climate-induced drought and pine beetles, voted no.
Representatives of districts in the “bread basket” whose farms are going to be crushed by warming voted no.
Now we move to the Senate where the politics are even more twisted.
I have opined on the inherently undemocratic nature of the Senate before.
Here is an analysis from Reuters on what to expect from the Senate.
Clearly, it’s going to take some incredible focus from t he White House , groups like the US Climate Action Partnership with its powerful industry membership, the national environmental organizations, the grassroots and the netroots, to get this legislation through to the President’s desk.
(There’ll be more from me soon on the politics in the Senate, based on some input from a conference I attended a couple of weeks ago, and other perspectives.
)
For now, I’m definitely not in the “no bill is better than a bad bill” camp.
It’s important to note that environmental laws and regulations have never followed a perfectly linear path.
It’s important to keep pressing on and get the best possible bill out of Congress - if one is even possible, given the damnable parochialism of the House of Representatives and Senate’s memberships.
The world “desperately needs” President Obama to attend the United Nations meeting in Copenhagen if an effective deal on tackling climate change is to be reached this December, according to one of the world’s leading climate experts.
Lord Stern, who was chief economist at the World Bank and is the author of the landmark 2006 study on the economics of climate change, was speaking after The Times disclosed on Saturday that Mr Obama was unlikely to be there, adding to concerns that Copenhagen is unlikely to yield a workable agreement amid continued deadlock between the US, China and India over pledges to cut their greenhouse gas emissions.
“We have not seen those sort of conditions for 30million years.
These kind of changes will have huge consequences — southern Europe is likely to be a desert; hundreds of millions of people will have to move.
There will be severe global conflict.”
So far, he said, public opinion in this country and around the world had simply failed to grasp the significance of the December meeting, the intention of which is to prevent catastrophic climate change by curbing emissions enough to prevent a rise of more than 2 degrees centigrade in average global temperatures.
“People need to understand just how big this is,” he said, adding that consumers needed to face the fact that dealing with climate change would mean higher costs for a range of basic goods, including energy and food.
“High carbon growth will kill itself .
. .
So we are setting up a process that will be extraordinarily beneficial in terms of energy security and biodiversity,” Lord Stern said.
“These are benefits that go well beyond tackling climate change.
If we get this right and introduce strong policies then we will kick off a process of industrial change that will be more profound than the industrial revolution.”
Rich countries would need to commit themselves to spending $50billion (£31billion) a year by 2015 to help poor countries to deal with the costs of adapting to the climate change that was now inevitable.
The US would need to provide perhaps $20billion of this total, he said, while the UK would need to spend $5billion a year — equivalent to £53 for every man, woman and child.
Developing countries, led by China, which is the biggest carbon polluter in the world, and India, say that at Copenhagen the developed world needs to commit itself to cuts of at least 40 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020 to avoid the worst of climate change.

Is “thinking green” an economic luxury?
Intuition implies that it may be, but so far there’s been little empirical evidence on the subject.
Two economists recently changed that: using data from Google keyword searches between 2004 and 2010, Matthew E. Kahn and Matthew J. Kotchen found that “higher unemployment rates within a state decrease internet search activity for global warming, but increase search activity for unemployment.
Based on this revealed preference for interest in global warming, therefore, it appears that recessions crowd out concern for the environment…” The authors also used recent survey data to analyze the link between unemployment and climate-change denial, concluding that “an increase in a state’s unemployment rate is associated with a decrease in the probability that residents think global warming is happening, and with a reduction in the certainty of those who think it is.
Higher unemployment rates are also associated with views that we should do less with respect to policies designed to reduce global warming.”

THE amount of plastic thrown away by Americans increased fourfold between 1980 and 2008.
It is a reasonable assumption that as more plastic is produced and discarded, this will affect oceanic pollution.
But a study of the north Atlantic and the Caribbean, just published in Science, suggests things are not getting worse.
Between 1986 and 2008 there was no increase in the concentration of plastic in the areas looked at despite a steady rise in the amount discarded.
Kara Law and her colleagues at the Sea Education Association in Woods Hole, Massachusetts have no explanation for this lack of accumulation.
A programme by the American plastics industry that resulted in a decrease in the number of pellets in the water is still insufficient to explain the data.
Nor does the missing plastic seem to have sunk; trawls at depth show no sign of it.
The Sargasso Sea of legend, and its modern equivalent, the Bermuda Triangle, are supposed to be places where things disappear without trace.
Dr Law seems to have come up with a real example.
In a new policy brief, RFF Senior Fellow Timothy Brennan explains that the long-term costs of ratcheting up liability for oil spills like the recent tragedy in the Gulf of Mexico will primarily be borne not by companies involved in oil exploration.
BP has accepted full financial responsibility for clean-up costs and lost wages for all who suffered direct consequences, such as local fishermen.
But in the future, two less mobile groups will be hurt when the high cost of complying with tough new regulations push oil exploration elsewhere: local workers and landowners concerned about the threat to the local economy when jobs are lost and all of us taxpayers from the loss of lease fees and taxes paid to the U.S. Treasury.
Individuals and Businesses that have incurred damages as a result of the Spill may submit a claim to the GCCF for Removal and Clean Up Costs, Damage to Real or Personal Property, Lost Earnings or Profits, Loss of Subsistence Use of Natural Resources, or Physical Injury or Death.
Duke and UNC-Chapel Hill signed a contract last September to work together in the demonstration project, which would evaluate the potential of wind energy and its environmental impacts on the sound.
People and businesses seeking a lump-sum settlement from BP ’s $20 billion oil spill compensation fund will most likely have to waive their right to sue not only BP, but also all the other major defendants involved with the spill, according to internal documents from the lawyers handling the fund.
Fishermen, shrimpers and seafood processors as well as hotel and restaurant owners with beachfront property in areas where oil washed ashore will have the easiest time getting reimbursed.
An ice cream parlor or a golf course miles from the affected shore but along the main highway headed to the beach will probably not be eligible, the documents indicate.

A mysteriously rugged mountain range hidden beneath east Antarctica's massive ice sheet has been revealed in all its topographic glory by an international research team.
The findings may cause geologists to rethink their ideas about the continent's history.
Another possibility is that the Gamburtsevs formed much more recently, as a result of volcanic activity.
But preliminary results from the expedition don't show the large magnetic anomalies that would typically be expected when flying over volcanic terrain, says Ferraccioli.
And recent work looking at sediments that spilled off the Gamburtsevs, before the ice sheet formed on top, also suggests that the range is not volcanic in origin ( T. van de Flierdt et al.
Geophys. Res.
Lett. 35, L21303; 2008 ).
Ian Dalziel, a geologist at the University of Texas in Austin, says there's no way to know exactly how old the Gamburtsevs are without drilling into them.
To him, the ruggedness of the range is "a surprising result", with no convincing explanation so far.
East Antarctica's ice sheet is thought to have formed roughly 35 million years ago, possibly nucleating atop the peaks of the Gamburtsevs.
The Antarctica's Gamburtsev Province Project (AGAP) was one of the major polar initiatives in the most recent Antarctic field season, involving researchers and support staff not only from the United States and Britain but also from Australia, Germany, China and Japan.
The teams split into two camps; the US group worked from the south camp closer to the South Pole, whereas the UK team worked from the north camp on the other side of the Gamburtsevs (see map ).
Temperatures at both sites averaged –30 °C; and bad weather at the south camp, at 3,500 metres altitude, kept its two Twin Otter survey planes grounded for days at a time.
Eventually, the teams did manage to gather data while flying a total of 120,000 kilometres back and forth across the ice sheet in a dense grid; the US portion alone covered a region the size of California (see graphic ).
The coverage is by far the most detailed look yet at the Gamburtsevs, although a Chinese expedition in the 2007–08 season gathered a line of radar data as it made its way from the coastal Zhongshan station to a new base China is constructing at Dome Argus (Dome A).
At their highest, the Gamburtsevs come within about 500 metres of the ice sheet's surface, says Bell.
At the base of the mountains, the tremendous pressure of the overlying ice sheet and relatively warm temperatures has caused the ice to melt, creating lakes and rivers that can be seen in the radar data.
As rivers cut ever deeper into the ground, the peaks could accordingly have been uplifted even higher, creating the dramatic topography seen today, says Ferraccioli.
The Gamburtsev valleys are up to 700 metres deep from valley to peak, says Bell.
The data may also help ice-core specialists who are looking for a site to drill the next deep Antarctic core.
Around Dome A — one primary target for drilling — the ice layers at depth are "quite contorted", says Ferraccioli.
That's not good news for those looking to drill unaltered ice layers to search for gas bubbles and other climate records from the past.
Meanwhile, AGAP's seismology team has deployed 24 seismological stations on the ice sheet above the Gamburtsevs.
"This is the first time that there's been an array of stations in the middle of Antarctica that have run successfully all year long," says Douglas Wiens of Washington University in St Louis, Missouri, the team's co-leader.
The stations have been gathering data on the subsurface structure by measuring seismic waves from large earthquakes, such as the Szechuan quake of May 2008, which pass through the Gamburtsevs on their way to the top of the ice sheet.
I think it's conceivable the Gamburtsevs, which are roughly at the geographic center of Antarctica, have been raised by compressive rebound forces generated by repeated cycles of ice deposition and melting over the face of the continent.
Essentially, ice loading on Antarctica, very approximately centered as it is on the South Pole of a spinning Earth, would tend to cause the continent to pull apart toward the Equator around its perimeter.
Any gaps generated by this stretching process in the relatively brittle and inelastic surface beneath the ice would be filled in, then when the ice melted in part or whole, the compressive forces along the surface pointing inward toward the center due to the rebound from the melting would tend to cause peaks to be pushed up at or near the center.
These peaks would tend to accumulate and build with each cycle of deposition and melting.
Hence, the Gamburtsevs.
A series of events took place yesterday all over the United States to indicate people’s concern about climate change.
The Step It Up website said: “In all 50 states, at more than 1400 iconic places across the nation, we have united around a common call to action: “Step It Up Congress: Cut Carbon 80% by 2050.’” Bill McKibben , a writer whose The End of Nature was the first popular book written on global warming, was the leading light of Step It Up.
Here’s coverage of the events and an interview with McKibben from “Democracy Now.”
There were a good number of other speakers including one of our leading urban environmentalists, Eric Goldstein from the Natural Resources Defense Council .
I also talked to Charles Komanoff at the rally.
Charles is one of the founders of the Carbon Tax Center and an energy economist who’s been around for a long time.
He has been one of the leading analysts of the financial issues around nuclear power.
(See this report from Greenpeace for instance.
)
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) from a speech yesterday at the Council on Foreign Relations , “I can tell you, mainstream scientists are convinced, mainstream CEOs are convinced, and if you look at the surveys, mainstream Americans are convinced, that global warming and climate change is real, and that we have to do something about it.” Also, from this week, a “Newsweek” special section on Leadership & the Environment: Green Issues : “For the record, Schwarzenegger says he’s deeply impressed with Gore’s work: he even popped into a Beverly Hills book-signing not long ago with his teenage daughter to tell the former vice president so in person.”

Lord Peter Levene, chairman of Lloyd’s of London: “We cannot risk being in denial on catastrophe trends,” Levene said January 12 in a speech to the World Affairs Council at the National Press Club.
“We urgently need a radical rethink of public policy, and to build the facts into future planning.” See Lloyd’s webpage on climate change here .

Stephen Hawking, physicist, best-selling author of A Brief History of Time, and claimant of the Cambridge University post once occupied by Sir Isaac Newton (the Lucasian Chair of Mathematics), has been quoted as saying, “I am afraid the atmosphere might get hotter and hotter until it will be like Venus with boiling sulfuric acid.” (See this article .
)
Jim Rogers, Duke Energy CEO and chair of the Edison Electric Institute.
Rogers played a key role in launching the U.S. Climate Action Partnership .
In this recent interview , Rogers said: “I think the probability that we’ll get good solutions to climate change — solutions that benefit both the planet and industry — is higher if we face the problem now than if we bury our heads in denial.
If you’re constantly trying to define the problem, or deny it, or dispute it, it gets increasingly difficult and costly to develop a good solution.” (I referred to Rogers and an article about him in my post, “The Business of Green” from March 9.

Evangelical Christian Pastor Rick Warren, named one of America’s Top 25 Leaders in the October 31, 2005 issue of “U.S.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel, commenting on the IPCC’s latest report, said: “The report confirms that climate change is a fact.
For that reason we need rapid and decisive action to limit the global rise in temperatures and to cut carbon dioxide emissions.” (See my post on the EU Summit Agreement from March 14 for more on Merkel and efforts in Europe.
)
British Prime Minister Tony Blair, from an article he wrote last October commenting on the Stern Report , cited at the PM’s web page on climate change : “The Stern Report should be seen across the globe as the final word on why the world must act now to limit the damage we are doing to our planet.
The conclusions are a wake-up call to every country in the world.”
British Conservative Party Leader David Cameron: “Today, in the twenty first century, the greatest long term threat this planet faces is climate change.” (From a speech from July last year.

Does climate change matter as an issue for the presidential campaigns?
See this from New Hampshire, giving a resounding yes to the question.
"An overwhelming 96% of Democrats and 82% of Republicans favor taking action now to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
" I referred to the Carbon Coalition in my post "Smorgasbord" below.
They are zeroed in on the candidates and the issue of climate change.
As of March 17, their Climate Change Resolution had been passed in 157 town meetings, turned down in 11 and been tabled in 5.
New Hampshire certainly does not represent the whole nation, but it's a pretty important barometer, particularly for the presidential campaigns.
(We have looked at world and national public opinion in two previous posts below, "The Ayes Have It" and "The Ayes Have It , Part Deux.
")
John McCain , His campaign website and Senate website both have information.
In testimony before the Environment and Public Works Committee on Jan. 30, McCain called climate change "the most important environmental issue of our time.
" He, of course, is the co-author of the " Lieberman-McCain Climate Stewardship Act " which was introduced three and a half years ago.
Rudy Giuliani , His campaign website is silent on environmental issues.
As someone who follows New York City politics and who was deeply involved in two mayoral races working on environmental issues, I will tell you that Giuliani, at best, did not pay much attention at all to the issue and there are any number of local open space and environmental advocates who will tell you his policies were regressive.
A New Hampshire news article from March 21 reported that Giuliani said: "I do believe there's global warming," and that an "overwhelming number of scientists" have cited "significant human cause.
"
Mitt Romney , In a speech in February, Romney called for increasing domestic energy supply with nukes, biofuel, " and other sources of renewable energy.
" He also said reducing per capita energy consumption was important.
He frames this as an energy independence concern, not tying it to climate change.
The news article from N.H. referenced above says that a spokesperson said he: "thinks it's likely human activity is contributing to the environment, but is not sure how much.
"
Sam Brownback , His campaign website refers to energy but not the environment or climate change.
It cites his co-sponsorship of an energy bill in the Senate that "that relies on advanced technology and an expansion of renewable fuels.
" His Senate website has about the same approach.
John Edwards , He's been pretty outspoken about climate change.
His website is quite specific about how to address climate change and establish a "new energy economy" creating a million jobs.
He says: "Our generation must be the one that says, "we must halt global warming.
' Our generation must be the one that says "yes' to renewable fuels and ends forever our dependence on foreign oil.
" Edwards has even called for April to be " Global Warming Action Month .
"
Hillary Clinton , She has consistently supported the Lieberman-McCain proposal, very much including a mandatory cap-and-trade system.
In a far-ranging speech on energy policy from May of last year, she called for reforming energy taxes, "clean" coal including sequestration, renewables, and a good number of other things.
Her Senate website says this, among other things, about climate change: "The scientific consensus on climate change is increasingly clear: unless we act to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, the planet will continue to warm over the next century, with widespread and potentially devastating effects.
"
Barack Obama , His campaign website addresses energy and global climate change.
About the latter, he says: "We need to take steps to stop catastrophic, manmade climate change.
" He cosponsored the Lieberman-McCain bill and he gave a speech in April of 2006 on " Energy Independence and the Safety of Our Planet " in which he said, rather unflinchingly, " unless we free ourselves from a dependence on these fossil fuels and chart a new course on energy in this country, we are condemning future generations to global catastrophe.
"
Bill Richardson , As head of the Department of Energy under Clinton and as Governor of New Mexico, Richardson has more of a track record than other candidates.
At DOE, he implemented energy efficiency standards and helped promote renewables.
Two years ago, Richardson and Arnold Schwarzenegger jointly called for a Western states initiative to develop at least 30,000 megawatts of clean energy in the West by 2015, and to increase the efficiency of energy use by 20% by 2020.
New Mexico has a Climate Change Action Plan and has entered into a " Western Regional Climate Action Initiative " along with California, Oregon, Arizona, and Washington.
Richardson's campaign website includes a speech on energy he gave on March 14 in which some specifics include reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 75% by 2050, getting auto efficiency to 50 mpg in ten years, and that climate change could mean "severe weather, flooding and drought and the alterations of agricultural production, rising sea levels, new disease patterns, widespread economic dislocations and destruction and a host of other problems.
" No punches pulled there.
Dennis Kucinich , " Climate Change: We Have Been Warned " is a speech from the House he gave last May.
In it, he cites some grave statistics.
On energy policy, his website says: "There has to be a renewable energy portfolio of at least 20% by 2010.
And that means introducing wind, solar, hydrogen, geothermal, biomass, and all of the options that must be available and need incentivizing.
That also means withdrawing incentives for the production of nonrenewable energy.
"
Chris Dodd , The campaign website says that by: "using energy more efficiently, and by using more clean and renewable sources of energy, Sen. Dodd believes that we should be able to lead the world in reducing the amount of greenhouse gas emissions that are contributing to global warming.
In his view, it is high time that the United States re-join the commitment made by industrialized nations in Kyoto, Japan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
"
Joe Biden , On climate change, the website says the candidate "supports a "cap and trade' approach to regulating emissions and investment in technologies that can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
" On energy, he would make "a substantial national commitment by dramatically increasing investment in energy and climate change research and technology so that the United States becomes the world leader in developing and exporting alternative energy.
"
Mike Gravel ­, " Global Warming/Climate Change " is the paragraph title at his website.
"We must act swiftly to reduce America's carbon footprint in the world by passing legislation that caps emissions," it says, among other things.
Okay, that's the overview.
You will hear more and more about the issues of climate change and energy policy from the candidates as the campaign progresses, not only in New Hampshire but everywhere.
This may be the first time, in fact, that energy and the environment become top-tier campaign concerns.
I want to send you to my colleague Bonnie Boyd's terrific article on climate change in Central Asia.
Bonnie is the FPA's blogger on Central Asia and has got some really interesting posts going up.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued its second report of the year yesterday in Brussels.
(I referenced this in "Headlines" below on April 3.
) The IPCC Report is titled "Climate Change 2007: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability" , that's a mouthful.
Go to the IPCC website for all the material relevant to this including the " Summary for Policymakers " and a video of the press conference.
There will be 16 regional press briefings around the world in the next couple of weeks, including one in Washington on April 16.
There are over a thousand news articles about this listed by Google.
I won't get into the specifics too much here.
Suffice it to say that the headlines read like this one from Reuters: " U.N. panel issues stark climate change warning .
" The BBC has this informative interactive map by region and by area of concern to describe what's being reported.
(I touched on some of the impacts that are being found in "Bits and Bobs" from March 30 below.
)
One serious bone of contention between some of the 2,500 scientists who've been involved in this year's series of IPCC updates and some of the government representatives who represent political interests is how much damage global warming has already been responsible for causing.
(This particular 1,572-page report was prepared by more than 200 scientists, and a 21-page summary was endorsed by officials from more than 120 countries.
) But, the conclusion, after all the jockeying, is that human activity causing global warming " over the last three decades has had a discernible influence on many physical and biological systems.
" One of the co-chairs of the report team said: "We're no longer arm-waving with models.
This is empirical information on the ground.
"
It's clear, for instance, that carbon dioxide has been making the world's oceans more acidic.
Harvey Marchant, lead author on polar regions for the report, said: "Carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere continue to rise, putting a greater strain on the world's oceans which are being forced to absorb more of these emissions than ever before and with potentially catastrophic effects.
" Elizabeth Kolbert, the brilliant and passionate journalist and author of Field Notes from a Catastrophe: Man, Nature, and Climate Change , had a stunning article on this in "The New Yorker" on November 20 last year: "The Darkening Sea , What carbon emissions are doing to the ocean.
"Another immediate concern is the vulnerability of certain populations, many of which live in coastal regions.
I referenced the 634 million people who live in vulnerable shore areas under Global Ecology in "Bits and Bobs" below, and a report on the dangers from storms and rising seas.
See also this terrific slide show from Andrew Revkin and the "NY Times.
" Rajendra Pachauri, Chairman of the IPCC, said: "It's the poorest of the poor in the world, and this includes poor people even in prosperous societies, who are going to be the worst hit.
" In a report timed to coincide with the IPCC schedule, "Save the Children" claimed " Children's future in jeopardy as climate change set to create up to 175m young disaster victims every year .
"
So, we're hearing again that it's past time to act.
Ed Markey, Chairman of the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming in the U.S. House of Representatives, said: "This Congress must rise to the challenge of transitioning from energy sources that threaten the planet and preparing for the damage we can no longer avoid.
" (See more from Markey.
) Hans Verolme of WWF (formerly the World Wildlife Fund) said: "The urgency of this report…should be matched with an equally urgent response by governments.
" Michael Oppenheimer, a world leader in public interest science for many years and an author of the report, said: "The actual outcome in terms of damages and ruined lives and costs depends heavily on the response ‚ the response of individuals to deal with the changes and governments to organize and anticipate and deal with this in advance.
"
Energy efficiency and green building are both integrally connected to the burgeoning new energy economy, and I will have a good bit to say about these as we go on through the year, but I want to just highlight renewables for the moment.
Biofuels and nuclear seem to me to be in a different category too from pure renewable energy.
Wind, solar, geothermal, fuel cells, hydro, and even ocean and tidal power.
These are the technologies that have fascinated me since the first Earth Day.
I think the genie is finally out of the bottle.
It's not a little exciting for me to see all this incredible activity.
It should also be exciting for anyone who's concerned about climate change.
This is a great overview of the state of the solar energy business from "The Economist" , " Bright prospects " from March 10.
Here's some refreshing news about wave power from Environment & Energy Publishing: " The New Wave , Grid Power from the Sea .
" There are some wonderful video and other links in this special report.
However, there's always some fly in the ointment or other.
In the case of one ambitious project in Cornwall, it appears that " Surfers Make Waves in British Battle of the Breaks.
" On geothermal, in January a major new report found enormous " potential for geothermal energy within the United States" and " that mining the huge amounts of heat that reside as stored thermal energy in the Earth's hard rock crust could supply a substantial portion of the electricity the United States will need in the future, probably at competitive prices and with minimal environmental impact.
" See this from the M.I.T.
news service and the report itself .
(Big file , 14.5 mb!
) That's the good news.
The bad news is " White House seeks to cut geothermal research funds .
" Natch.
On wind power, on one ambitious and highly promising front, there's the Cape Wind project which promises that "Average expected production will be 170 megawatts which is almost 75% of the 230 megawatt average electricity demand for Cape Cod and the Islands of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket.
" Now don't let anybody tell you that I think Republicans are the ones who always spoil the party.
See this for instance: " Ted out to blow down windmills .
" To be fair, let Sen. Kennedy give you his perspective .
Supreme Court - As of noon Eastern time today, Google listed 1,127 news articles reporting on yesterday's U.S. Supreme Court decision , 5-4, in favor of the plaintiffs in probably the most important climate change case to be adjudicated anywhere in the world.
Here's the story from "The Guardian" and from "The Online NewsHour.
" See this excellent analysis from Felicity Barringer at the "NY Times" and the "backstory" on podcast with her.
Reaction was generally muted from the EPA and the Bush Administration , see yesterday's press briefing from the White House.
The reaction from some of the interested parties was, however, predictably jubilant.
"Fantastic news" was what the environmental secretary for Massachusetts deemed it.
Massachusetts was the lead plaintiff.
Senator Barbara Boxer, a sponsor of the strongest of the global-warming proposals so far put before Congress, said: "This decision puts the wind at our back.
" A really critical player in Congress in all of this, John Dingell, had this to say: "Today's ruling provides another compelling reason why Congress must enact, and the president must sign, comprehensive climate change legislation.
" (I mentioned Dingell's history, importance and role in last week's post, "Bits and Bobs" below.
)
Here's the caveat in all this, though: The EPA will not break any speed records in racing to control carbon dioxide from automotive emissions nor any other source.
The EPA is a creature of the presidential administration and this President has said it's not on.
What is happening, though, is that momentum is building.
Congress will likely pass legislation this summer to increase energy efficiency and to boost renewable energy.
In the autumn, they may well get to passing something substantive on controlling carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
The pressure is definitely on the White House, as a result of the Supreme Court's decision and any number of other factors, including the pressure that will brought to bear on the U.S. at the G-8 summit in Germany in June .
IPCC Report , "Climate Change 2007: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability" is due out on Friday from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
Advanced coverage of the report emphasizes the disparity in how various populations of the world are able to deal with climate change.
A piece in the "NY Times" Science section today highlights the problems.
There are a number of good resources there, including a reader forum in which you can take part.
That there is uneven development in the world is not, I'm afraid, news.
What is news is that people are raising the question of global warming's impact on the situation now and how it may exacerbate conditions in many impoverished places in the future.
The Kyoto Protocols have an important feature: the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM).
The idea is to have richer nations help poorer nations by developing CDMs to boost sustainability.
The UN administers the program and you can go to this interactive map to find projects throughout the world.
Update: Glad to have gotten one wrong.
I said above that I thought the EPA would sit on its hands, but it is moving to process California's request for a waiver for automotive standards on carbon dioxide.
See this: “EPA revives California's request to set tough emission standards”
Politics - There is much to be discussed regarding the politics of climate change, internationally, between various stakeholders, and, of course, within countries.
Two pieces from "The Economist," for instance, illustrate the intense politics in Britain around climate change: "Climate change - A hot topic gets hotter" and the Bagehot column, "Brave Dave v Cautious Gordon.
" Both are from March 15 and both talk about the jockeying by the parties, Tory, Labour and Liberal Democrats, to be greener and to be seen by the British public as greener.
This, in my opinion, is a good battle to have waging.
To quote from the Bagehot column: "But for all Mr Blair's pioneering efforts, it is David Cameron who can claim to have done most to make climate change the topic of the moment.
It is probably fair to say that without the pressure (and the cover) that has come from Mr Cameron, the government which Mr Brown will soon lead would not be committing itself to the kind of measures called for by this week's draft bill on climate change.
" (Go here for these articles and some others but be cautioned that "The Economist" is not free.
You can get a trial subscription in order to see these.
You can also see my post of March 14 below on the British initiatives.
)
In the U.S., there are an array of political tensions: between Republicans and Democrats, of course, but within the parties as well, and between factions within other constitutencies, such as the conservative Christian community.
I will but dip my toe into these waters for the moment, by citing two recent articles.
The first is about the "conversion" of John Dingell, the exceedingly powerful former and once-again chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee in the House of Representatives.
Go here to see the committee's recent activity on climate change.
Dingell, back 20 years ago when I and many others were engaged in fighting for an acid rain title for the Clean Air Act, was a thorn, to say the least.
(George Bush, pere, it should be noted to his credit, helped break the logjam to bring forth the acid rain legislation in 1990.
) To return to Dingell, he represents a district in Detroit and he's spent his entire career being very protective indeed of the interests of the auto industry.
A recent article, though, "Changed Climate on Warming," from the "Wall St. Journal," reports that: "Rep. John Dingell once dismissed global warming as a "theory.
' Lately, the Democratic lawmaker from Michigan has had a change of heart.
"The science on this question,' he said recently, "has been settled.
'" (Sorry to say, again, that this has gone into the pay-for-the-article zone.
You can go here to access it, or get it from the library.
)
The other story that I want to flag for you concerns the very public spat between elements of the Evangelical Christian community in the U.S. One recent focus of the contention has been the very active campaign waged against global warming by Richard Cizik, the vice president for governmental affairs of the National Association of Evangelicals.
The NAE, for your information, is an umbrella group, with hundreds of organizational members, and represents on the order of 30 million Americans.
See " NAE rebuffs critics, affirming Cizik and a wider agenda " from "The Christian Century.
" (Bill McKibben is another featured writer for them.
) The NAE has an active "Creation Care" initiative.
You can hear Cizik talk about that here at NPR .
You might also check out the Evangelical Climate Initiative .
It's being led by some pretty heavy hitters out there, among them Rick Warren, Jim Wallis, Leith Anderson, and former New York City congressman Floyd Flake.
Agriculture , The U.S. Department of Energy's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, with a modest annual budget of about $1.6 billion and a staff of over 8,000 employees, is known for some pretty hotshot research.
A recent report from them, Global scale climate,crop yield relationships and the impacts of recent warming , appeared in the very highly regarded "Environmental Research Letters.
" The press release from the LLNL says: "Warming temperatures since 1981 have caused annual losses of roughly $5 billion for the major cereal crops " One of the lead authors says: "A key moving forward is how well cropping systems can adapt to a warmer world.
Investments in this area could potentially save billions of dollars and millions of lives.
" Also at the LLNL website is a link to an earlier report on how "Changes in agricultural practices could help slow global warming.
"
Economic Consequences , Since we've hit on the subject, it might be a good moment to introduce the blockbuster report, from the British government, from October 30 of last year: the " Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change .
" It lays out some stark economic prospects:
Using the results from formal economic models, the Review estimates that if we don't act, the overall costs and risks of climate change will be equivalent to losing at least 5% of global GDP each year, now and forever.
If a wider range of risks and impacts is taken into account, the estimates of damage could rise to 20% of GDP or more.
Global Ecology , Here's an arresting lead: "A new global warming study predicts that many current climate zones will vanish entirely by the year 2100, replaced by climates unknown in today's world.
" The study, discussed in this story from the University of Wisconsin-Madison (my alma mater) was funded by the National Science Foundation and is further reported by them here .
Another understated, nevertheless alarming thought, from the paper itself: "Climate is a principal influence in species distributions and ecosystem function, and the disappearance of existing climates, or the development of future climates not found at present, could have profound ecological consequences.
"
And this headline got my attention too: "Climate change: study maps those at greatest risk from cyclones and rising seas" , This story is from Science Daily and comes from the International Institute for Environment and Development .
Fun fact: 634 million people ‚ one tenth of the global population ‚ live in coastal areas that lie within just ten meters above sea level.
In my post from March 19 on some international polling results, one of the salient findings was that Americans' consciousness and concern regarding climate change has risen dramatically in the past few years.
Two new polls confirm that.
The first , released March 12 from the Yale Center of Environmental Law and Policy's Environmental Attitudes and Behavior Project, says "83 percent of Americans now say global warming is a "serious' problem, up from 70 percent in 2004.
" Sea Change in Public Attitudes Toward Global Warming Emerges reads the headline for the press release.
Further: "Most dramatically, the survey of 1,000 adults nationwide shows that 63 percent of Americans agree that the United States "is in as much danger from environmental hazards, such as air pollution and global warming, as it is from terrorists.
'"
Not incidentally, online ballots will be up in the not-too-distant future for all eight of the Foreign Policy Association's Great Decisions categories for 2007, including climate change.
I will flag that here when they're up.
Stay tuned.
First of all, Step It Up .
Bill McKibben, a seminal writer on climate change, is leading this nationwide effort in the U.S. His The End of Nature was a clarion call on a par with Rachel Carson's Silent Spring.
I have noted his articles in the "NY Review of Books.
" On April 14 , coming up very fast , the website notes: "There are already 1043 events planned in 50 states across the country!
" You can go to the website to get more information, including what events are near you.
The Sierra Club, my environmental activism alma mater, is always in the game.
Their Global Warming & Energy webpage has great information and can get you going on taking action.
Lobbying at the federal, state and local levels is a terrific endeavor.
See if your local group is working on the issue.
Are you in high school or college in the U.S. or Canada?
See these folks: The Campus Climate Challenge .
They are revved up and working hard and well connected.
Next Generation Earth is an effort of the Earth Institute at Columbia University .
The Earth Institute has been very busy indeed in bringing together major stakeholders and forging important strategies and tactics for dealing with climate change.
The big news from GM this week was that they joined the U.S. Climate Action Partnership , the tremendously influential group of major American companies that have been driving for action on climate change.
They’re the first automaker to join and that’s, as Bernie Sanders might say, “Yoog.” See this story from Reuters and the press release from GM .
I noted a while back that Congressman John Dingell, chair of the House Energy & Commerce Committee, was on board for tough legislation.
He’s been Detroit’s most important champion in Congress for many years and if GM and Dingell are on board, then that’s good news for those pushing for effective federal legislation.
I wrote about Dingell and his critical role here on March 30.
Since billions of people live in cities, with more coming every day, the infrastructure needed to support them needs building, rebuilding and rehabilitation, expansion and enhancement.
There's power generation and transmission, the delivery of drinking water and the treatment of waste water, housing and parks, schools and hospitals, transportation, and commercial and industrial development.
All this activity requires energy and energy, as we know, is primarily carbon-based throughout the world.
As I pointed out in my post, " Mike Bloomberg's Earth Day ," the Big Apple's carbon dioxide output is on a par with that of Switzerland, Norway and Ireland.
New York City has 8.2 million folks with probably 800,000 more on the way in the next several years.
The OECD reports that "60-80% of worldwide energy consumption occurs in urban areas.
"
The fascinating event I attended yesterday, the Regional Plan Association 's annual assembly, focused on the problem of global climate change and how to address it.
Robert D. Yaro, RPA's president, said that climate change will influence planning for the foreseeable future.
Former New Jersey Governor Jim Florio spoke about the imperatives of minimizing our carbon footprint and said that economic advancement and environmental sensitivity were not incompatible.
The present N.J. Governor, Jon Corzine, was to have given the morning's keynote address but, because of a recent terrible car accident in which he was involved, was replaced by Gary D. Rose, the Chief of N.J.'s Office of Economic Development.
Corzine has an ambitious energy master plan that's being developed now that will require a 20% increase in energy efficiency and 20% of electricity from renewables.
This echoes the plan proposed by N.Y. Governor Eliot Spitzer recently.
Rose, like Florio, emphasized the opportunity in developing a "clean and green tech economy" and that this sort of activity could "support the next great wave of economic growth.
" (See my last post - opportunity is what I'm seeing, and I'm sure glad that I'm in the company of folks who know their way around high finance, venture capital, and economic development.
See also my post from March 9 on " The Business of Green ," and the mention of venture capitalists and their enthusiasm for renewables.
)
The Assembly Chairman, Theodore Roosevelt IV, is an investment banker and certainly knows his way around these matters.
He's also the Chairman of the Lehman Brothers' Council on Climate Change .
John Llewellyn, a Kiwi with an impressive track record as an economist at the OECD, and now the Senior Economic Policy Advisor to Lehman Brothers, gave a stunning presentation on the realities of climate change and their implications for corporations.
Llewellyn tells CEOs that the science is sound, the climatology is too, that the economic analysis shows that no matter how bravely and well we address global warming, we are going to have impacts: 2 to 3% of global GDP is going to be destroyed by the impacts of climate change annually.
(See the Stern Review from the U.K. and its analysis of economic consequences as referenced in my post from March 30 .
) You can find much of Dr. Llewellyn's compelling presentation on The Business Of Climate Change - Challenges and Opportunities here .
(There's that word "opportunity" again.
)
There were six breakout sessions: on carbon markets, protecting water resources under the pressures of climate change, transportation options, siting, green building, and the one I attended, "Tilting at Windmills?
Opportunities for Green Power Generation.
" One of the panelists was Jim Gordon, President of the Cape Wind project.
He reported that NRDC has characterized Cape Wind as the largest single GHG reduction project in the U.S. He also reported that in the six years that the project has been going through the regulatory process, 20 offshore projects have been built in Europe and 25 more have been approved.
He gave us a heads up too to a book that's coming out next week: Cape Wind: Money, Celebrity, Class, Politics, and the Battle for Our Energy Future on Nantucket Sound .
Cities for Climate Change is doing a lot of important work.
I think this is a compelling thought from the mayor of Charlotte, N.C.: "We are the ones building roads, designing mass transit, buying the police cars and dump trucks and earth-movers.
We're the ones lighting up the earth when you look at those maps from space.
Together we have huge purchasing power and if we invest wisely, that can have huge implications for the environment.
"
I'm going to another exciting event in ten days: the C40 Large Cities Climate Summit .
Much more soon on how cities are approaching the climate change crisis.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), as I write, is finalizing its report, "Mitigation of Climate Change.
" (You can watch the webcast of the press conference from Bangkok when it goes online on Friday, and read the summary for policymakers and the speech from the IPCC's head.
) There will be a ton of news stories, neither will we lack for analysis and spin.
There are, of course, vital issues of costs , those to be incurred and those to be avoided by mitigating global climate change.
If you look at the outline for the report , you will see that economic considerations are front and center.
Sections have been written on "cost and benefit concepts," macroeconomic effects," and "economic and other generic policy instruments.
" There is some very heavy economic lifting indeed in this report.
"Sierra" (from the Sierra Club, of course), has a special section in their latest issue : "Climate Exchange.
" In it, a panel of top experts and policy makers discuss where we are in grappling with the challenges of global warming.
The worthies assembled by the Sierra Club include one of the founders of Sun Microsystems; one of the world's leading climatologists; Sen. Barbara Boxer, the chair of the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee; as well as her senior advisor on climate change; and some others.
Coverage at the website includes video clips from the panel discussion.
See this video from the BBC on HRH the Prince of Wales's "mayday" alert on the climate crisis.
"The crisis of climate change is far too urgent and discussion simply isn't enough," said Britain's Prince Charles at the first May Day Business Summit on Climate Change .
More than 1,000 businesses, convened by Prince Charles, made concrete commitments to reduce carbon emissions.
He gave several speeches at the event.
Here's the welcome , given on the first day of the summit.
(Links are here also to other of Charles's speeches and articles, including on organic farming, historic preservation, and sustainable business.
) Charles has been a quiet, forceful, progressive voice in Britain for years.
He's also hugely influential.
We don't have anyone like him in the
U.S. In any event, it's great to see him so outspoken on climate change.
See my colleague Cassandra Clifford's recent two articles on Children and Climate Change.
These, along with the rest of her material, are hard hitting.
Start here .
Germany's New Energy Efficiency Initiative , In this story from Agence France-Presse (via WBCSD Energy & Climate News ), we learn that "Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel called for additional investment of three billion euros (four billion dollars) to develop energy-saving technologies " You can go to the English-language website of the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety to get information on their programs on climate and energy.
When this sort of gathering happens, and when corporate bigwigs like the CEOs of Dupont and PG&E, and the Vice Chair of BP America come to the Senate to testify on behalf of a cap-and-trade system for GHG emissions, and an organization like the U.S. Climate Action Partnership is out in front on creating legislation, then we are seeing a paradigm shift.
“ FRONTLINE and the Center for Investigative Reporting go behind the scenes to explore how bi-partisan political and economic forces prevented the U.S. government from confronting what may be one of the most serious problems facing humanity today.
The film examines some of the key moments that have shaped the politics of global warming, and how local and state governments and the private sector are now taking bold steps in the absence of federal leadership.”
Here's one big-ticket item: plant a million trees!
Sweet. "Beyond aesthetics and emotional well-being, trees perform important functions that protect and enhance city dwellers' health and property.
Trees literally clean the air by absorbing air pollutants and releasing oxygen.
They reduce stormwater runoff and erosion; they temper climate; they can save energy; they create wildlife habitat; they can improve health, serve as screens, and strengthen community.
They can even help contribute to a community's economy and way of life.
" The USDA has a wealth of information on the benefits of the urban forest.
So here's the part that's most germane for this little sector of the blogosphere: the plan has a significant component on climate change .
Fun fact: The sheer scale of our city means that New York emits nearly 60 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, slightly more than Switzerland and Norway and slightly less than Ireland.
We're looking now for a 30% reduction from the 2005 baseline by 2030.
The idea is to get reductions of 33.6 million tons - 10.8 million tons coming from "clean power," 16.7 million from "efficient buildings," 6.1 from "sustainable transportation," plus an additional 15.6 million avoided by accommodating 900,000 people in New York City or "avoided sprawl" as the Plan terms it.
Plus, the City will devise a comprehensive plan for dealing with weather impacts that are likely to come no matter how negatively or positively global warming trends.
This is all heady stuff.
Bloomberg and New York City are hosting the " C40 Large Cities Climate Summit " next month.
"Cities are responsible for three-quarters of the world's energy consumption, and as such, the world's largest cities have a critical role to play in the reduction of carbon emissions and the reversal of dangerous climate change," says their website.
I'll let the Mayor get the last word in here.
He's earned it, for my money, with this plan.
"Climate change is a national challenge, and meeting it requires strong and united national leadership.
The fact is, the emerging consensus among scientists is that, to avoid serious harm, we must reduce our emissions by 60 to 80 percent by 2050.
"
U.N. Security Council - On Tuesday, Britain, holding the rotating presidency of the Security Council, brought the issue of climate change forward.
(See this from “The International Herald Tribune” and this from the BBC.
) The U.K.’s Foreign Secretary, Margaret Beckett, for five years her country’s lead climate change negotiator, said: “There are few greater potential threats to our economies, too, but also to peace and security itself.” (See the Stern Report for further background on her reference to the world’s economies.
) Beckett gave a speech the night before to the Foreign Policy Association and its partners titled “ Climate Change - The Gathering Storm .” She concluded by saying: “Now it is time for us to rise to our newest and biggest challenge: to fight the first great war of interdependence, the struggle for climate security.”
At the Security Council on Tuesday, there was a considerable push back by developing nations.
China’s delegate didn’t quite see it the way that Beckett did.
Ambassador Liu Zhenmin asserted, “Developing countries believe that neither has the Security Council the professional competence, nor is it the right decision making place for extensive participation leading up to widely acceptable proposals.” The “ Times of India ” reported: “Indian ambassador to the UN Nirupam Sen rubbished the idea that climate change presented any kind of imminent security issue that the Security Council should deal with.” Ouch.
U.S. Security Concerns , Last Monday, the non-profit CNA Corporation, issued a report called “ National Security and the Threat of Climate Change .” The report was prepared by some serious former American military top brass.
The website says: “Global climate change presents a serious national security threat which could impact Americans at home, impact United States military operations and heighten global tensions ” That’s unequivocal.
General Gordon Sullivan, Chairman of CNAC’s Military Advisory Board, followed up with a release applauding the Security Council’s activity on the subject (see item above) and then testified before the “Select Committee On Energy Independence And Global Warming” in the House Of Representatives.
(Their website is pending.
) He testified: “After listening to leaders of the scientific, business, and governmental communities both I and my colleagues came to agree that Global Climate Change is and will be a significant threat to our National Security and in a larger sense to life on earth as we know it to be.” One more radical leftist tree hugger on record.
(See my post “ If You Don’t Like Al Gore, Then ) A “NY Times” editorial from yesterday included this zinger: “In an alliance of denial, China and the United States are using each other’s inaction as an excuse to do nothing.”
On the subject of climate change and conflict, I want to refer you to the excellent work of the Environmental Change and Security Program (ECSP) of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.
They’ve been at this work since 1994.
As a student of the etiology of conflict, I can tell you that this is a critical area of inquiry.
See also the seminal work of Thomas Homer-Dixon , the director of the Trudeau Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies in Toronto.
Finally, my colleague, Bonnie Boyd, the blogger on Central Asia, has been writing a series of important articles on environmental issues and impacts.
Start here: Central Asia & Climate change: Overview .
IPCC , On North American Climate , As a follow-up to the IPCC report from April 6 , see my post “Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability” , regional briefings have been given all over the world.
The one for North America was given in Washington on Monday.
See this coverage from “ABC News” for example , “ Global Warming May Put U.S. in Hot Water .” Another news organization, McClatchy Newspapers, reported here : “More droughts, floods, heat waves, infectious diseases and extinctions are possible for two of the most prosperous countries on the planet ” One of the lead authors, Michael Oppenheimer, put it this way: “Water at large is the central (global warming) problem for the U.S.” (The North American section of the report has not yet been posted at the IPCC website but should appear here when it does, soon one presumes.
) Another of the lead authors, Cynthia Rosenzweig, talked to WNYC radio last week: “ Ground Water: Climate Change Could Flood Subways .” This sort of flooding, not incidentally, was the theme of the event I attended last Saturday, the Sea of People , part of the national Step It Up campaign.
(See my post on it below.
)
“Newsweek” and “MSNBC.com” have devoted a huge amount of coverage recently to climate change.
See their website “ Learning to Live with Global Warming ” which has a great body of useful material.
I went to a hugely informative event yesterday.
It focused on the "carbon markets" and was organized by the non-profit Ecosystem Marketplace .
The symposium was also geared as a promotional event for their new book: Voluntary Carbon Markets: A Business Guide to What They Are and How They Work .
What's a carbon market you ask?
Well, that's a good question.
There are quite a few dimensions to this area.
"In addition to setting emission limits, the Kyoto Protocol provides several market-based mechanisms to enable GHG emitters to achieve their assigned reductions.
The basic idea, trading emission rights, has been successfully implemented for other pollutants in many countries.
Under this system, because some countries will be able to reduce emissions more easily and cheaply than other countries (for example through forest-based carbon offset projects), they can sell their surplus reductions (or carbon credits) to countries that emit more than their limit.
This will enable achieving the overall global emissions target at the least cost.
Carbon projects can therefore generate financing for conservation by selling certified carbon credits to GHG emitters.
" (This is from the Conservation Finance Guide , a joint project of the Conservation Finance Alliance ).
Credits from Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects are a particularly hot ticket these days according to one of the experts from the symposium who works for Evolution Markets .
(See my reference to CDMs under "IPCC Report" below in Headlines .
)
One of the progenitors of the "cap-and-trade" system that allows polluters to accumulate "credits" is Environmental Defense, back when they were the Environmental Defense Fund.
The system was conceived with sulfur dioxide in mind.
Acid rain is largely a consequence of sulfur dioxide emissions from electrical and industrial power plants.
The push for this system to be deployed within the acid rain title of the Clean Air Act reauthorization was led by EDF.
See " The Cap and Trade Success Story " from Environmental Defense.
Very interestingly to me, at yesterday's symposium, Peter Koster, CEO of the European Climate Exchange , said that after Kyoto when the Europeans were looking for compliance mechanisms, they were urged by Clinton and Gore to adopt a "cap-and-trade" system because of the success of the acid rain program in the U.S. Now the Europeans are vigorously briefing members of Congress and staff, as well as legislative and executive branch leaders and staff in California, about how it all works in Europe.
See this story , for instance, from "The Hill," on some of the issues involved in crafting legislation.
See also " Four Principles for Successful Climate Policy " from Environmental Defense.
Of the four principles, one is about the cap and two are about trade.
So, you've got the "regulated" markets where requirements have been instituted on emissions and credits are traded.
But you've also got the "voluntary" markets.
In brief, according to this report from the International Institute for Environment and Development: "The voluntary market refers to entities (companies, governments, NGOs, individuals) that purchase carbon credits for purposes other than meeting regulatory targets.
" You can, for instance, offset the GHG burden of your roundtrip vacation flights.
You go to a provider who then takes the amount of money that has been calculated to offset the carbon expenditure you've made and applies it to some worthy project.
I referenced this sort of activity in my post on the " Business of Green " , see the third paragraph.
One of the folks on yesterday's panel, Josh Harris from The Climate Group, is involved in creating a " Voluntary Carbon Standard .
" (The article on the VCS is from ClimateBiz , a terrific resource.
) Here's another fun bit from yesterday: Distinctions are made in all of this between "commodity" carbon and "gourmet" (or "pretty" or "charismatic") carbon.
In other words, individuals and companies may wish to buy into projects that some may deem "prettier" (rainforest or coral reef protection, for instance) so that they feel as if they're getting more "green" for their greenbacks (or euros or yen).
Companies may tend this way because of the greenwash value or the enhancement they feel that may accrue to their corporate social responsibility (CSR) profile.
To be sure, this is a consideration that has grown enormously in importance for top corporate management and their boards.
Another worthy from yesterday's panel, Gia Schneider from Credit Suisse, pointed out that there are opportunities for companies in GHG reduction and they are finding more and more of them.
Energy efficiency and renewable energy initiatives, the most salient examples, bring costs down.
Here's a good example from the BBC: " French plan green postal service .
" What could be more obvious?!
Of course, I've been saying that sort of thing for many years.
(See my post below on Renewable Energy ).
I remember, going back many years, the visionary " Pollution Prevention Pays (3P) " program from 3M.
They say: "Over the last 30 years, the program has prevented more than 2.5 billion pounds of pollutants and saved over $1 billion based on aggregated data from the first year of each 3P project.
" The Rocky Mountain Institute , for instance, will help your business, as will hundreds of other consultants.
As RMI puts it: "Advanced techniques for resource productivity can now greatly reduce environmental impacts while providing superior goods and services at lower cost.
"
Let me note one more comment from another of yesterday's panelists, an old-timer like me, Skip Rankin from the law firm, Baker & McKenzie .
He said he'd been involved for 20 years in renewable energy projects and was pleasantly astonished to be seeing the intense level of activity that he's seeing now.
(I said in my post on Renewable Energy below that I myself felt like Rip Van Winkle with everything taking off as it is).
Skip's involved in creating contractual standards for carbon transactions.
Not incidentally, a great resource on climate change and the law is the ABA.
Their forthcoming book, Global Climate Change and U.S. Law , was edited by an old and good acquaintance - and easily one of the most prolific writers and editors I've ever known - Mike Gerrard.
(My post below on the "Business of Green" also references an informative article from the "NY Times" on the law and climate change.
)
As yesterday's symposium and one of the panelists in particular made abundantly clear: "The game is already on.
" The markets are here, and they are going to grow enormously.
Theoretically, they should greatly enhance the process of reducing greenhouse gases thereby diminishing the chances of catastrophic climate change.
As a party political issue, the environment has been a slow grower.
The fact that two prime ministers-in-waiting are currently raising the political heat over global warming shows how far the topic has travelled up the agenda.
Indeed, the battle for the green vote between the new adversaries intensifies today, with David Cameron revealing he would replace the controversial climate-change levy, the government's prized pollution tax on business, with a new "carbon levy".
His words follow a keynote address from Gordon Brown at the UN in New York, in which he defended the climate-change levy, saying it was "central" to the government's approach to cutting CO2 emissions.
Over the next five years, it would lower such pollution by six million tonnes, one third of Britain's total carbon reductions by 2010.
A poll earlier this year confirmed voters were increasingly prepared to make sacrifices to sustain the environment.
Around 63% of respondents approved of a green tax to discourage behaviour harmful to the environment.
For the most part, Mr Cameron has avoided detailed policies, saying they are still under review.
But he has argued that without economic "green growth", the measures to tackle climate change cannot be afforded.
Yesterday, as Mr Cameron gazed at melting icebergs off Norway, the chancellor was in New York telling world leaders climate change needed a global solution.
Over the next 48 hours, he will explain how Britain will invest in a new institute for research into alternative sources of energy and will call for an £11bn facility to diversify developing countries' energy supply.
In 2004, Professor Sir David King, the government's chief scientist, said the threat to the planet of global warming was worse than from terrorism.
Last week, he warned the Earth's temperature was likely to rise by at least 3C, putting 400 million people at risk of hunger and leaving up to three billion without adequate water supplies.
But while the environment will be the stuff of domestic politics in elections to come, expert and non-expert alike realise only by concerted worldwide action can the planet's climate be saved.
America, the world's largest polluter, is relying heavily on new technology to produce the solution; neither George W Bush nor the US Congress is willing to jeopardise Americans' standard of living.
As it develops at breakneck speed, the new kid on the economic block, China, is setting tough targets on limiting energy consumption and reducing pollution.
But it has missed them year on year.
Is “thinking green” an economic luxury?
Intuition implies that it may be, but so far there’s been little empirical evidence on the subject.
Two economists recently changed that: using data from Google keyword searches between 2004 and 2010, Matthew E. Kahn and Matthew J. Kotchen found that “higher unemployment rates within a state decrease internet search activity for global warming, but increase search activity for unemployment.
Based on this revealed preference for interest in global warming, therefore, it appears that recessions crowd out concern for the environment…” The authors also used recent survey data to analyze the link between unemployment and climate-change denial, concluding that “an increase in a state’s unemployment rate is associated with a decrease in the probability that residents think global warming is happening, and with a reduction in the certainty of those who think it is.
Higher unemployment rates are also associated with views that we should do less with respect to policies designed to reduce global warming.”
This is hardly surprising given the strident and explicit connection the media makes between global warming and economic harm.
I’m not sure this indicates independent thinking so much as the fact that the unemployed may simply have more time to bask in the ignorance peddled 24/7 on radio and TV.
Just because unemployment has gone up and global warming concerns have gone down doesn’t mean that one caused the other.
It’s more likely, in my opinion, that the spike seen in 2007 was the great interest people had in the subject, causing them to learn more about the subject, and realize the truth that man-made global warming is bunk.
I know that of all of my friends/family, it’s been education regarding global warming that was increasing skepticism well before unemployment and recession were hot topics.
But I’ve been living frugally all my life and using CFLs for more than fifteen years, yet I’ve never typed “global warming” into a search engine, so one needs to be clear what, precisely, is being measured.
People who are already “thinking green” won’t be showing up in a survey of search terms, only people who are thinking about _going_ green.
“higher unemployment rates within a state decrease internet search activity for global warming, but increase search activity for unemployment.
Based on this revealed preference for interest in global warming, therefore, it appears that recessions crowd out concern for the environment…”
“higher unemployment rates within a state decrease internet search activity for global warming,…” —-Many who search for GW info are school kids writing reports.
But even so, since GW interest maybe on the downswing, but interest in the economy is; how does this make sense?
“Based on this revealed preference for interest in global warming, therefore, it appears that recessions crowd out concern for the environment…”—Or maybe this is just a meaningless pairing.
I’ll bet the glaciers receding correlate nicely with the declining Google interest in Britney Spears.
who cares?
One way to combat global warming is to decrease consumption.
The problem here is that pundtis are used to framing the discussions around the ‘environment’ vs ‘business’ tradeoff.
This is entirely the wrong way to think about Climate Change.
That is an epochal trend that will affect Everyone.
In any epochal change, there will be winners and losers, hence great opportunities.
The questions is, can be think about it in a way to stimulate our Creativity to take advantages of opportunies and help ameliorate the impacts on losers who will be most affected by it.
It is exactly this kind of scare mongering that allows the opponents of climate change to gain traction.
In the long run (next few centuries) we are going to decide to warm he planet anyway to better terraform it and make use of all the ice locked land.
A warmer wetter earth is an earth with a higher carrying capacity, and teraforming other terrestrial bodies will be heinously expensive.
But you cannot expect people to make decisions based on whats good for civilization long term when they cannot even make decisions based on whats good for 10 years from now.
I don’t think Washington has made a decision with more than a 6 month payoff horizon in two decades, maybe more.
Its certainly necessary if you believe in climate change and/or ‘peak oil’ costs.
The results of climate catastophies are catastrophic.
They cost not only lives but cause innundations and floods that cost huge sums of money.
Economic melt down and climate collapse may not be in a direct causal relationship but indirectly human activity can cause havock to an economic system.
This happened during the thirties when the dust bowl to say tthe least made the depression very much worst.
Lest some one start mumbling about sunspots in the 30s they can be sure that overintensive land use was the prime cause of the loss of topsoil.
For all those who wish to hide their heads in the sand and claim there is no connection between human settlement patterns and climate, I suggest that they take a trip to Glacier National Park or Glacier Bay Alaska.
Both are in retreat and have been since explorers first named them.
The wall of ice that was the glacier on the coast of Alaska has retreated enough for it to be called Glacier Bay.
I think that underemployment is intimately linked to the environment so it is unfortunate that the voice of the unemployed can’t rise to this.
One of the main reasons for underemployment seems to be distorted economies of scale and suboptimal resource allocation due to fossil fuels being sold at subsidized prices that don’t reflect their true cost current cost (inlcuding environmental).
Humans as a cost factor in production are penalized because resource allocation decision-making is based on short term cost considerations that don’t include the long term cost of fossil fuel pollution, thereby creating irrational economies of scale.
Big companies like this because they depend on transport and subsidied fuel.
When oil went up to $150/barrel it stimulated local production factors.
So it would seem that now is the time to tax oil, stimulate localized production and use the tax resources for lowering the debt.
I have somehow obtained a copy of a letter from the Congressional Budget Office to the Chairman of the Committee on Natural Resources of the U.S. House of Representatives about the budgetary issues governing the leasing of oil and gas resources on the Outer Continental Shelf [ PDF ].
Among its dark secrets is this:
You asked for information about the budgetary implications of a recent administrative action and potential legislative changes in policies governing the leasing of oil and gas resources on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS).
In particular, now that the President has removed previous restrictions on leasing in areas off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, you asked how CBO would estimate the budgetary impact of legislative proposals ...
This is only part of the benefit-cost analysis that should be conducted.
Other benefits are the market effects of increased oil and gas.
Costs include environmental costs.
I'll try to get this part completed later this afternoon and send a letter to the Chairman of the Committee on Natural Resources of the U.S. House of Representatives.
Town officials wants to prohibit boaters from dumping waste from their onboard toilets into public waters around the town.
They suspect it's one of the reasons for deteriorating water quality in Banks Channel.
Armed with preliminary data from UNCW researchers, the town wants the Environmental Protection Agency to establish a "no discharge zone" for waters within the town's borders.

Permafrost is any rock or soil material that has remained below 32° F (0° C) continuously for two or more years.
The two-year minimum stipulation is meant to exclude from the definition the overlying ground surface layer that freezes every winter and thaws every summer (called the "active layer" or "seasonal frost").
This material underlies 12 to 18 percent of the exposed land surface in the Northern Hemisphere.
Seasonally frozen ground regions may cover as much as 55 percent.
Soil moisture content, overlying snow cover, or location does not define permafrost; it is defined solely by temperature.
It can contain over 30 percent ice, or practically no ice at all.
It can be overlain by several meters of snow, or little or no snow.
Understanding permafrost is not only important to civil engineering and architecture, it is also a crucial part of studying global change and protecting the environment in cold regions (se also mountain permafrost ).
The long-term records of the near-surface temperature, obtained from different parts of the permafrost zone in northern regions, show a significant warming trend during the last 30 years.
Ground temperature trends generally follow the trends in the air temperatures with a more pronounced warming in the lower latitudes (between 55° and 65° North).
This recent climate warming brought soil temperatures to a surprisingly high level, about 1 to 3°C warmer than long-term averages.
Within some areas, temperatures are very close to 0°C and at some sites long-term degradation has already started.
Areas of forest are now referred to as 'drunken forests', and as it melts the trees fall over.
Much of the Northern Hemisphere frozen ground is overlain by evergreen boreal forest.
These boreal forests comprise both a source and a sink of carbon.
In fact, the Arctic contains nearly one-third of the Earth's stored soil carbon.
So significant amounts of carbon are sequestered in perennially frozen soils (permafrost) and within the active layer, which thaw every summer but completely re-freeze during the following winter, where the organic matter decomposition is slow.
That is why the majority of northern ecosystems are carbon sinks at present time.
Climate warming and drying caused by this warming permafrost degradation will change this situation.
A thicker, warmer and dryer active layer will activate microbes during the summer.
Significantly later freeze-up of this layer in winter and warmer winter temperatures (that means much more unfrozen water in it) will considerably enhance the microbial activities during the winter.
So, the arctic and sub-arctic ecosystems are turning into a source of carbon dioxide, instead of storing carbon dioxide previously locked up in the permafrost.
Further degradation and formation of taliks (an unfrozen section of ground found above, below, or within a layer of permafrost) will amplify these changes because microbial activities will then continue during the winter.
In these areas of "wet thermokarst" formation, new and significant sources of methane will be developing.
Besides the dramatic impacts of sudden ground collapse and landslides, these swampy wetlands will release large quantities of methane, a greenhouse gas some 21 times more powerful than carbon dioxide.
This has already been observed - during the unusually warm summers of 1987 and 1989, for example, methane emissions at observed sites on Alaska's North Slope increased more than three times and two times respectively.
The social costs of higher temperatures have been mostly negative, and the Bush administration report, drafted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), also found few positives to Alaska's thermal rise.
The government reported to the United nations, "There can no longer be any doubt that major changes in the climate have occurred in recent decades in the region, with visible and measurable consequences.
" On the Kenai Peninsula, a forest nearly twice the size of Yellowstone National Park is in the last phases of a graphic death.
Century-old spruce trees stand silvered and cinnamon-collared as they bleed sap.
The spruce trees are dead or dying on the Kenai Peninsula from a huge increase in spruce bark beetles.
In the past the beetles feeding on the evergreen trees don’t survive the winter, but populations have exploded as temperatures rise.
Throughout the Kenai, people are clearing some of the 38 million dead trees, answering the call from officials to create a "defensible space" around houses for fire protection.
Last year, two major fires occurred on this peninsula, and with temperatures in the 80s in mid-May this year, officials say fire is imminent.
Ed Holsten of the Forest Service says it is just a matter of time before they have a very large, possibly catastrophic fire.
- Temperatures have increased during the last 20–30 years in almost all areas of the Northern Hemisphere.
Warming of this ground mass is also reported from areas of mountain areas.
This warming has not yet resulted in widespread thawing.
Climate changes are projected to result in thawing across the subarctic by the end of this century, with the most significant thawing occurring in North America.
- The frozen ground stores a lot of carbon, with upper layers estimated to contain more organic carbon than is currently contained in the atmosphere.
Thawing of this frozen ground results in the release of carbon in the form of greenhouse gases which will have a positive feedback effect to global warming.
- Thawing of this ice-rich land results in the formation of thermokarst, where parts of the ground surface have subsided.
Thermokarst affects ecosystems and infrastructure and can accelerate thawing.
- Thawing of permafrost has significant impacts on ecosystems, with the potential to completely change habitats, for example, from boreal forest to wetlands.
In mountainous areas thawing may increase slope instability, raising the risk of natural hazards such as landslides and rock falls.
Climate change is the biggest ecological problem?
Many global warming deniers love to hear anything that could imply that there's no such thing as global warming.
The latest example that could be used to their defense is Argentina's Perito Moreno glacier that doesn't follow global warming trend, and is constantly growing.
Scientists cannot explain why Perito Moreno is showing completely different pattern than most of other glaciers, but on the other hand nobody has ever said how all glaciers should react exactly the same to climate change.
Does this example really show that there's no global warming and climate change?
Very unlikely because this is really an exception and not a general rule, and you can find much more places on our planet where glaciers are melting than the ones where they are actually expanding.
Arctic, large parts of Antarctica, Himalayan glaciers and many other examples show that there is indeed a rise in global temperature, and that this example with Perito Moreno is really some strange exception that still awaits scientific explanation.
We mustn't forget that climate change is global phenomenon, and that we need to look at things at global level, and if we indeed take a global look we can sadly see that global warming is already a reality.
Climate change is not all about ice melting but also about extreme weather events like flooding and droughts that have recently become much more frequent than they used to be.
I would really love that science is wrong in this case and that there's no such thing as global warming and climate change bud sadly much more evidences can be gathered to support global warming theory than to deny it.
All current climate change models predict that worse is yet to follow, and that we could see so much more of climate change by the end of this century.
Glaciers melting will not only cause significant sea level rise but also water scarcity in many corners of the world.
We can still escape the worst if world agrees new climate deal and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, at least this is what science suggest us.
I really do not see a reason why science would lie in this case.
What good would science have by making up such a story?
Therefore I do not understand people that deny climate change.
What proofs do they offer?
For one their proof that global warming doesn't exist there is at least ten proofs that climate change is really happening.
Call me pragmatic or whatever but to me numbers are the ones that count the most.
And numbers definitely support global warming theory.
In any case take a look at this nice video.
It will give you much more insight into Perito Moreno glacier, one of the few glaciers that isn't feeling the "global warming heat".
At least not yet.
Hmmm, global outlook indeed when you look at the global picture you see a cooling trend coming around.
Low temp records have been broken in many areas in July, August, and beginning of September.
In addition, if man made global warming existed then we should be shattering every high temp record there is and yet there are still high temp records that still stand from the 1800s and early 1900s.
Global outlook, a few glaciers start growing because of increased snowfall and decreased global temps should make one think that it might be the start of a cool down.
Structures in Antarctica are being buried and new ones being built on top of covered structures and some are saying Antarctica is shrinking yes on one side do to volcano activity but the other side is growing.
Speaking of volcanic activity both land and underwater volcanoes dump more CO2 and toxic chemicals then we do in addition undersea volcanoes dump mass amounts of heat.
I believe it was the documentary Drain the Ocean, stated that there about 5 to 8 times the amount of active undersea volcanoes than previously thought and previous numbers were around 30,000; a lot of heat.
Core sampling shows that short periods of warming always proceed a longer cooling period.
Global warming is a natural cycle not manmade.
Oh, almost forgot NASA has started to speak against man made global warming (on the basis that evidence of solar activity has dramatic effects on climate change, which now indicates a cooling approaching) and over 30,000 scientist have signed a partition to denounce man made global warming.
Why? Because there are always a few scientist that have no ethics and will do anything to make money; don’t believe me?
Take an engineering/scientific based ethics course and you will understand why it is possible for scientists to lie, I applaud the scientist the stand-up and sign partitions that side on truth.
The programme involved eight Indian institutes that worked with British research institutes like the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research, Exeter.
The institutes studied the impact of climate change on sea-level variability, water resources, forests, agriculture, health, energy, industry and transport infrastructure in India.
The Indo-British study says the intensity of cyclonic storms might increase, leading to more 'extreme sea-level events'.
The sea level is expected to rise in three locations on the east coast of India, and the southern peninsular coast will become the most vulnerable.
Studies conducted on three river basins -- the Krishna, the Ganges and the Godavari – showed climate change would affect them immensely.
"The hydrological cycle is projected to be more intense with expected increase in extremes and intensities.
Model simulations indicate a general increase of about 20 per cent in precipitation over the three river basins, with consequent increase in surface water availability,"
The study predicted extreme climatic events increasingly disrupting the Konkan Railway service.
Climate change will boost power generation needs by 1.5 per cent and result in increased occurrence of malaria, it added.
While most of India will have till the end of the 21st century to face the brunt of nature's fury, the impact of climate change on the forests will be felt within the next 40 years, days the research.
Composition of species and their dominance could also be altered, and large-scale forest depletion and loss of biodiversity are likely to mark the beginning of the bleak scenario.
Ranindranath says that while there would be an increased production of timber in the short- and medium term, there would be a disruption in timber supply in the long term.
Similarly, loss of biodiversity will result in loss of livelihood for forest-dependent communities.
"As climate change could cause irreversible damage to unique forest ecosystems and biodiversity, there is a need to develop and implement adaptation strategies like identifying forest management practices and forest policies to reduce vulnerability of forest ecosystems,"
Climate change is one of the key phrases in scientific research today.
Experts across the globe are busy decoding Mother Nature's signals to understand just how much damage man has done to Earth, and just how soon he will begin reaping the deadly harvest of what he has sown over centuries.
The Indo-British study was undertaken as a result of British prime minister's promise to the United Nations General Assembly in 1997 that the United Kingdom would collaborate with key developing countries to study the impact of climate change.
About 30 journalists from Pakistan and India met at a workshop in Islamabad at the end of March to discuss common (transboundary) water problems affected by climate change.
The fact that the Indian participants’ involvement was agreed only at the very last moment is a small example of the persistent tensions between the two countries (described by one journalist at the workshop as “a competition in cussedness”).
But another fact, that the workshop was held at all, is a tribute to the doggedness of the two journalists whose achievement it was, Rina Saeed Khan of Pakistan and Joydeep Gupta of India, both of them CCMP alumni.
Because of visa delays, only seven journalists from India who are climate change specialists managed to make it to Pakistan.
The remaining 23 journalists who have an interest in and experience of environmental reporting came from all over Pakistan.
There was a mix of print and electronic journalists from big media houses, and members of the Urdu language press were also invited.
“ …some prophets of doom may foresee a future filled with conflicts as every country seeks to satisfy its water needs from increasingly limited water resources, but history bears witness to the fact that cooperation, not conflict, is the most logical response to trans-boundary water management issues.
The need of the hour is to think in global terms; whether upstream or downstream, we are all in the same boat.
I am hopeful that this all-important consultative workshop on “Sharing our Resources: A Vision for Addressing Cross-Border Water Scarcity Caused by Climate Change” will help boost our efforts to think and act together.”
African countries,Asia are in the forefront of having the impact of the climate as many people (farmers) lost their land,desertification,low rain fall,bad air (pollution)while the industrialized Nation refused to cut down their emission
Officials and experts say negotiations on climate adaptation have become ever more complicated, leaving least developing countries badly frustrated as they badly need funds to cope with inevitable impacts of climate change.
Cameroon has learnt that it will have no access to funds to be made available to combat the effects of global warming.
Its exclusion from eligibility for some of the US $30 bn being raised is because the government has not signed the Copenhagen Accord, agreed by some countries late last year in the Danish capital at the end of the UN climate summit.
Developing countries were offered $30 bn over the next three years at the Copenhagen summit to let them start work immediately on climate adaptation, mitigation, technology transfer, capacity building and forest conservation.
Most of the money is still to be made available by donors.
In the long term, the stated intention is to provide $100 bn annually from 2020.
Asked why Cameroon had not signed the Accord, the head of its delegation, Mr Joe Armathe, said: “I cannot answer that question.” He explained that after the Copenhagen summit the delegation made a proposal to the Prime Minister and President of Cameroon.
The proposal, he said, outlined specific activities to be undertaken in the area of climate adaptation and mitigation in the country.
So it is for the Prime Minister and possibly the Presidency to decide whether Cameroon signs the Accord or not.
According to Mr Armathe, signing it, however imperfect it may be, would constitute a first step towards a legally-binding agreement on tackling climate change.
He acknowledged that Cameroon will miss out on the current funding offer.
If this happens, it would mean that Cameroon may not have the money needed to continue work in many climate change adaptation and mitigation activities.
Recognizing the urgency of securing eligibility for the funding, Mr Armathe said he would initiate a letter to the Prime Minister through the Ministry of Environment and Nature Protection to inform him of the disadvantages of not signing the Accord.
Even though Cameroon is excluded from benefitting from the fast start financing now, it could still do so if it signs the Accord in future.
Among the 191 countries that make up the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), 127 have signed.
Zimbabwe, Sudan, Niger, Liberia, Egypt, Somalia, Libya, Sao Tome & Principe and Equatorial Guinea are among the few African countries that have not signed the Accord.
Officials and experts say negotiations on climate adaptation have become ever more complicated, leaving least developing countries badly frustrated as they badly need funds to cope with inevitable impacts of climate change.
In case you missed it , CO2 and etc is pollution:
The Supreme Court ordered the federal government on Monday to take a fresh look at regulating carbon dioxide emissions from cars, a rebuke to Bush administration policy on global warming.
In a 5-4 decision, the court said the Clean Air Act gives the Environmental Protection Agency the authority to regulate the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from cars.
Greenhouse gases are air pollutants under the landmark environmental law, Justice John Paul Stevens said in his majority opinion.
Whether you are a conservative or liberal economist you should think that CO2 is a pollutant, since it is an outcome of production and consumption that harms a third party (i.e., it is a negative externality).
This gives government the, er, obligation to regulate to improve economic efficiency (i.e., social welfare).
Scalia's dissent included a rather convoluted argument that even though carbon dioxide is a chemical substance emitted into the air, it's still not an "agent" of air pollution because "air pollution" really means pollution of the air at ground level.
(As he is wont to do, he supports this position largely by reference to Webster's New International Dictionary 1910 (2d ed.
1949).) Check it out, it's kind of awkward.
Carbon dioxide is no more a pollutant than oxygen or water.
Each is a crucial part of our ecosystem, and changing the amounts of the substances in our air can lead to dramatic change.
If instead of carbon dioxide we greatly increased the amount of oxygen in the air by our actions, the results would be drastic.
If water levels rose by 20 meters at our coastlines, the results would be catastrophic.
But you wouldn't call oxygen or water a pollutant.
"Carbon dioxide is no more a pollutant than oxygen or water.
"
Ever hear of 'Thermal Pollution'?
Water can very well be regulated as a pollutant, especially water of different properties than the water surrounding it.
No one argues the negative effects of thermal pollution, either.
It can harm fish spawning and living conditions, promote excessive algal blooms, and even clog intakes down-river due to promotion of invertebrate growth.
Similarly, output of CO2 as a material may not be a pollutant, BUT CO2 above the prevailing PPM (or general environmental concentration) can very well be counted as a pollutant, for much the same reasons.

blog). That is a very nice service to the profession.
We've talked a lot in the past about the Coase Theorem and how it should work.
The idea is simple: If property rights can be well defined and if there are no impediments to bargaining, polluters and victims should be able to negotiate a settlement that is in everyone's best interest.
That's how it should work...but as we all know, how things should work and how they do are often very different.
With two of my three kids diagnosed with asthma--the only one not is the gymnast who spends most of her exercise time indoors--I started wondering where I could go to breath clean air.
Here's Money Magazine's list of the top 25 cities ranked by percentage of 'good' air quality days.
The lowest on the list of top 25 has good air days 95.3% of the time.
We here in the greater Columbus, OH area have good air 33.7% of the time.
Damned coal power.
I'm obsessed.
Last week I posted about my views on indoor smoking bans.
My confusion troubles me because I can't figure out why the market didn't solve the issue long ago...if the demand for nonsmoking establishments is so great, why didn't some bar/restaurant owners go smoke free for profit?
But, outdoor smoking, now there's something I can talk about.
Restaurants and bars have walls to help define property rights, beaches and parks don't.
So who has the property rights over the air along a beach?
It looks like nonsmokers are going to win this battle...at least in San Diego :
Worried about the health effects of secondhand smoke and sick of cleaning up discarded cigarettes, San Diego has banned smoking at its beaches and parks.
The city joins nearly 2,300 other municipalities across the nation that have barred smoking in a variety of public places.
A pollution advisory was issued Thursday in Great Smoky Mountains National Park warning visitors of unhealthy levels of ground-level ozone.
At the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, ozone concentrations exceeding health standards were recorded overnight Wednesday at two higher elevation monitoring stations and conditions were expected to continue Thursday.
This would mark the third unhealthy day of the 2006 summer ozone season in the Smokies, the country's most visited national park on the Tennessee-North Carolina border.

New Hampshire is mandating a cut in mercury emissions at its power plant -- 80 percent by 2013.
Any reduction beyond 80 percent can be used to bank against future SO2 emissions (acid rain, smog).
The greenies are mad:
[Doug] Bogen [of Clean Water Action] said this is the first state in the country to allow credits from one pollutant to be traded for reductions of another.
I don't really blame them this time.
I've never heard of banking one pollutant for another.
But then, I don't know everything.
In a recent interview, Philip Verleger --former member of the President's Council of Economic Advisors under Carter-- claims that relaxing environmental rules today will lower the price of gas (I believe that), increase pollution today (I believe that) and somehow magically create the incentive to build more ethanol refineries and lower pollution in the long-run (I don't believe that).
The state policy goes beyond mercury reduction standards announced by the Bush administration last year.
The federal goal is to cut mercury pollution 70 percent nationwide by 2018, although the DEQ says Michigan probably would see little if any reduction until 2025 or later.
Following up on the Krugman post on Exxon and global warming, Scientific American's blog discusses the extent to which climate models have been tested against the data and summarizes recent research on this issue indicating the problem may be more severe than present models suggest.
This post notes, briefly, the similarity between monetary policy and policy to address global warming when model uncertainty is present and has a summary of the Scientific American discussion.

... the Environmental Economics blog ... is now the default homepage on my browser (but then again, I guess I am a wonk -- a word I learned on the E.E.
blog). That is a very nice service to the profession.
Since billions of people live in cities, with more coming every day, the infrastructure needed to support them needs building, rebuilding and rehabilitation, expansion and enhancement.
There's power generation and transmission, the delivery of drinking water and the treatment of waste water, housing and parks, schools and hospitals, transportation, and commercial and industrial development.
All this activity requires energy and energy, as we know, is primarily carbon-based throughout the world.
As I pointed out in my post, " Mike Bloomberg's Earth Day ," the Big Apple's carbon dioxide output is on a par with that of Switzerland, Norway and Ireland.
New York City has 8.2 million folks with probably 800,000 more on the way in the next several years.
The OECD reports that "60-80% of worldwide energy consumption occurs in urban areas.
"
The fascinating event I attended yesterday, the Regional Plan Association 's annual assembly, focused on the problem of global climate change and how to address it.
Robert D. Yaro, RPA's president, said that climate change will influence planning for the foreseeable future.
Former New Jersey Governor Jim Florio spoke about the imperatives of minimizing our carbon footprint and said that economic advancement and environmental sensitivity were not incompatible.
The present N.J. Governor, Jon Corzine, was to have given the morning's keynote address but, because of a recent terrible car accident in which he was involved, was replaced by Gary D. Rose, the Chief of N.J.'s Office of Economic Development.
Corzine has an ambitious energy master plan that's being developed now that will require a 20% increase in energy efficiency and 20% of electricity from renewables.
This echoes the plan proposed by N.Y. Governor Eliot Spitzer recently.
Rose, like Florio, emphasized the opportunity in developing a "clean and green tech economy" and that this sort of activity could "support the next great wave of economic growth.
" (See my last post - opportunity is what I'm seeing, and I'm sure glad that I'm in the company of folks who know their way around high finance, venture capital, and economic development.
See also my post from March 9 on " The Business of Green ," and the mention of venture capitalists and their enthusiasm for renewables.
)
The Assembly Chairman, Theodore Roosevelt IV, is an investment banker and certainly knows his way around these matters.
He's also the Chairman of the Lehman Brothers' Council on Climate Change .
John Llewellyn, a Kiwi with an impressive track record as an economist at the OECD, and now the Senior Economic Policy Advisor to Lehman Brothers, gave a stunning presentation on the realities of climate change and their implications for corporations.
Llewellyn tells CEOs that the science is sound, the climatology is too, that the economic analysis shows that no matter how bravely and well we address global warming, we are going to have impacts: 2 to 3% of global GDP is going to be destroyed by the impacts of climate change annually.
(See the Stern Review from the U.K. and its analysis of economic consequences as referenced in my post from March 30 .
) You can find much of Dr. Llewellyn's compelling presentation on The Business Of Climate Change - Challenges and Opportunities here .
(There's that word "opportunity" again.
)
There were six breakout sessions: on carbon markets, protecting water resources under the pressures of climate change, transportation options, siting, green building, and the one I attended, "Tilting at Windmills?
Opportunities for Green Power Generation.
" One of the panelists was Jim Gordon, President of the Cape Wind project.
He reported that NRDC has characterized Cape Wind as the largest single GHG reduction project in the U.S. He also reported that in the six years that the project has been going through the regulatory process, 20 offshore projects have been built in Europe and 25 more have been approved.
He gave us a heads up too to a book that's coming out next week: Cape Wind: Money, Celebrity, Class, Politics, and the Battle for Our Energy Future on Nantucket Sound .
Cities for Climate Change is doing a lot of important work.
I think this is a compelling thought from the mayor of Charlotte, N.C.: "We are the ones building roads, designing mass transit, buying the police cars and dump trucks and earth-movers.
We're the ones lighting up the earth when you look at those maps from space.
Together we have huge purchasing power and if we invest wisely, that can have huge implications for the environment.
"
I'm going to another exciting event in ten days: the C40 Large Cities Climate Summit .
Much more soon on how cities are approaching the climate change crisis.
Solar Thermal - A modest 5 MW plant opening in the California desert is very much a harbinger of more to come.
Ausra Opens its First Concentrating Solar Power Plant in California is another story from EERE.
I wrote about Ausra here last March.
I said then “Ausra’s website has some terrific graphics, well worth seeing, and some fun speculation: “Solar Thermal Power Could Supply Over 90 percent of U.S. Grid Plus Auto Fleet.’” Talk about bullish on CSP!
“Flexible” Carbon-To-Liquid Fuel Process - According to researchers at Purdue University, we could be producing “alternative fuels, hydrogen and electricity from municipal solid wastes, agricultural wastes, forest residues and sewage sludge that could supply up to 20 percent of transportation fuels in the United States annually.” See this from “CarbonFree” and this from Purdue.
These sorts of pyrolysis or gasification plants have extraordinary potential.
(I envisioned them once in the context of a comprehensive proposal for New York City’s modest 25,000 tons a day of municipal solid waste and called the plan, Urban Gold .
The heart of the strategy is to co-locate a materials recovery facility [MRF] and other waste disposal facilities, such as pyrolysis or gasification plants, with industries that would use the recycled materials as feedstock for their manufacturing.
)
As I think I may have said before, without China, folks, getting a handle on global warming ain’t going nowhere.
Seems to me like they’re very much in the game.
Check out the article for more good news.
Species Loss - The bad news is that the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has issued its “Red List” for 2008 and there are many species endangered and threatened.
That there are environmental threats to thousands of species is not news, certainly, but global warming is exacerbating the problem.
This in itself is also not news, unfortunately, but the IUCN is documenting the dangers.
In this article from ENN, we note: “Thirty-five percent of the world’s birds, 52 percent of amphibians and 71 percent of warm-water reef-building corals are likely to be particularly susceptible to climate change”
See also this article from “Time” - How Climate Change Will Impact Animals .
This article quotes the president of Conservation International , Russell Mittermeier: “Global warming is something that all conservationists are worried about.” You can also get audio of an interview with Mittermeier.
Bali Action Plan - For the wonks amongst us, you can find a new report from UNDP, “The Bali Action Plan: Key Issues In The Climate Negotiations - Summary For Policy Makers” here .
Spanish President Jose Zapatero gave an address in which he noted a number of critical issues in which Spain is actively engaged.
One of these is climate change.
He noted his country's leading position on renewable energy.
He said that countries which take the lead in developing and deploying new renewable technologies will enjoy huge advantages.
(This echoes what I heard recently from a leading writer, editor and consultant on energy who I was interviewing for an article on the "smart grid" movement.
) Spain has one of the top wind energy industries in the world.
This good little article from "Treehugger" characterizes Spain as an RE "powerhouse.
" One of the biggest manufacturers worldwide is Gamesa .
Not incidentally, I wrote here recently about Spain's push for electric cars.
President Zapatero's claims are entirely well founded.
The first to speak was Benita Ferrero-Waldner, EU Commissioner for External Relations and Neighborhood Policy.
She cited the IPCC and other research identifying climate change as an extraordinary threat.
She noted that a number of analyses have identified it as a "threat multiplier," so it is a significant security concern as well.
She quoted Robert Schuman, one of the visionaries who fostered the creation of the organizations which grew into the European Union: "World peace cannot be safeguarded without the making of creative efforts proportionate to the dangers which threaten it.
" (See the entirety of the landmark "Schuman Declaration" here .
) Ferrero-Waldner was clearly equating the overall threat of catastrophic climate change with world war.
Unfortunately, for my money, she dwelled a little overmuch on the question of pipelines carrying oil and natural gas coming into Europe and not enough on the potential for regional and international cooperation on renewables.
(See my references here and here about the extraordinary potential in the Desertec initiative and the "SuperSmart" grid.
)
Ashok Gupta is an old hand, having led NRDC's efforts on energy for years.
He defined energy security as encompassing not only the availability of the energy supply but also how energy use impacts global climate change and local and regional environmental concerns.
He also emphasized the critical importance of energy efficiency.
Phil Sharp is a former Congressman who runs Resources for the Future , an influential policy shop in Washington.
He said that oil prices are going to remain high for the foreseeable future, driven by demand, and by the fact that we are in the age of Peak Oil .
He thinks energy is going to remain very high on our to-do list because of these factors and because of the threat of climate change.
He sees the need to "decarbonize" our societies.
Last, but not least by a long shot, was Vijay V. Vaitheeswaran, correspondent for " The Economist .
" Vaitheeswaran is quite articulate and had a number of salient points to make, among them that there are three pillars of energy instability: poverty, the environment, and geopolitics.
On the first of these, he cited the fact that much of the developing world is off the grid and relies on wood, coal, dung and other cheap fuels for energy for heat and cooking.
This has a devastating health impact because of the enormous amounts of soot generated.
(See my post, Black Carbon and Solar Cookers .
) On environmental concerns, he noted the problems of climate change and local pollution.
On the matter of geopolitics, he said that because there is so much oil concentrated in so few countries, that this is considerable cause for concern.
On the positive side, Vaitheeswaran and I share the perspective that there are extraordinary developments that are shaping things such that we will see the movement toward clean, reliable distributed energy continue to burgeon.
He identified three "megatrends" that are fostering an energy revolution: First, he sees "smarter" government involvement.
Governments are market minded, but they are increasingly thoughtful about energy and environmental policy.
Secondly, he says there's a bottom-up revolution being driven by NGOs (like NRDC, Environmental Defense Fund, and many others) in which there is a growing confluence in areas like climate policy and business.
(See, for instance, my review of EDF's Earth: The Sequel and the work of the US Climate Action Partnership .
) Finally, Vaitheeswaran sees a golden age of innovation coming into being.
I've referenced his book, ZOOM: The Global Race to Fuel the Car of the Future , a number of times here.
Permafrost , I wrote about the problem of thawing permafrost here recently.
One group of researchers in Canada, at least, believes that permafrost is more "stubborn" than previously thought and will melt more slowly than predicted.
See this story from AFP.
The qualification in this is that the uppermost layers of permafrost may degrade as quickly as predicted, releasing dangerous amounts of GHG into the atmosphere, but that the deeper levels will stay frozen for much longer periods of time.
You can find the abstract for their work here at "Science.

Meanwhile, in Chicago, the City has issued a comprehensive, detailed Climate Action Plan .
See also Chicago Sets Goals for a Cooler City from the Environmental News Service.
One big component here is addressing Chicago's buildings.
They will move to retrofit at least half of their buildings by 2020 hoping to gain a 30% reduction in energy use.
Their energy conservation and their buildings codes will be upgraded to align with the latest international standards.
This is right in line with what Britain has undertaken, as I noted in the post just below.
I've been an admirer of Mayor Daley's environmental leadership for years.
He really does get it.
Phil Clapp , We lost a very strong voice for working to address the climate change crisis this past week when Philip Clapp died.
See this from the "LA Times.
" He founded the National Environmental Trust which merged this year with the Pew Charitable Trusts .
These organizations have been doing groundbreaking work on climate change policy, as well as working on other environmental issues.
Historical note: The American environmental movement, and particularly the advent of the National Environmental Policy Act, received a big boost in the battle over a pumped storage plant proposal for Storm King Mountain in the Hudson Highlands in the 1960s.
There are dozens of pumped storage plants all over the world, but the Storm King idea, to be cited in a particularly beautiful part of the Hudson, spawned determined opposition that brought the modern environmental review process into being.

Shipping - Like aviation, seaborne shipping accounts for a relatively small percentage of GHG, but it is growing.
Making Ships Green, in Port and at Sea , is an article from the “NY Times” I’ve been saving for you for a few months.
Just as I found in writing my article on airports, ships, like planes, are hooking up to a local electricity supply when they’re in port in order to save power and reduce emissions.
In Sweden, where acid rain continues to be a big concern, this approach eliminates the particularly noxious pollutants from marine bunker fuel.
They’re hooking up in Belgium, LA and Long Beach too.
But acid rain is not the only consideration.
The article reports: “James J. Corbett, an associate professor of marine policy at the University of Delaware, is the co-author of a study published in December that attributed 60,000 cardiopulmonary and lung cancer deaths each year globally to shipping emissions and forecast an increase to nearly 85,000 deaths by 2012 under current trends.” See also this report, “ Green Harbours ,” from the Hong Kong nonprofit Civic Exchange.
(And try More Cool Stuff from me from March with the picture of the freighter with the kite for supplementary power.
)
On the other hand, see also Do food miles matter?
from the terrific “Environmental Science & Technology” from April.
The study cited says ” that transportation creates only 11% of the 8.1 metric tons of greenhouse gases (in carbon dioxide equivalents) that an average U.S. household generates annually as a result of food consumption.
The agricultural and industrial practices that go into growing and harvesting food are responsible for most (83%) of its greenhouse gas emissions.”
More about what we eat and how it affects the global climate system here soon.
Jim Rogers , I quoted the Duke Energy CEO here a while back.
In the Sunday "NY Times Magazine," there's a profile of the head of the nation's third-largest emitter of carbon dioxide.
Why has he been promoting a cap-and-trade law when it will impact his company so enormously?
The short answer: ""If you're not at the table, you're going to be on the menu,'" he says in the article .
The article is a good survey of where we are on climate change legislation and where the power industry is.
(Hint: not yet quite in the same place.
)
Algae Moves Up , Algae has a lot of possibilities.
Aside from its ability to grow very quickly and in a relatively small footprint, thus providing a much-more easily accessible and cost-effective feedstock for ethanol than corn, or even cane sugar, it also consumes enormous amounts of carbon dioxide.
Algae production can, in fact, be configured to act as a carbon sink.
This is precisely what is being piloted by a utility in Arizona.
(I wrote about this, also in "Earth: The Sequel" .
)
In this article from Reuters, we learn that an American company, Algenol, is in a deal with a Mexican company, BioFields, to build a large plant in the in the Sonoran Desert.
Algenol is aiming to produce one billion gallons, 10% of current US capacity, by 2012.
The West Antarctic Ice Sheet(WAIS) is a unique marine ice sheet, anchored to bedrock, and in places it dips thousands of metres below sea level with margins that are floating.
Other marine ice sheets existed in the Northern Hemisphere during the last glacial maximum but all disintegrated and melted away during the current warm period.
The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is the only marine ice sheet remaining from the last glacial period.
Marine ice sheets are important because their existence and future behaviour depend not only on atmospheric conditions and ice movement, but also on sea level changes.
As the sea level rises, more of the ice at the edge of the sheet floats, and the forces that hold the ice sheet together are reduced, causing ice to flow more rapidly to the oceans.
This positive feed-back loop (sea-level rise, leading to reduced forces holding the ice together, leading to increased ice flow into the ocean, leading to sea level rise) could lead to rapid disintegration or collapse of a marine ice sheet.
The present ice sheet would not need to melt and thin by much in order for the ice to begin to float.
When the glaciers begin to float, warm ocean water is able to reach the undersides of the floating glacier tongues and melt rates increase significantly.
This means that the West Antarctic ice sheet may be uniquely capable of rapid deglaciation (melting), and many scientists are quite concerned about this possibility.
If the WAIS was to melt and disappear it would raise sea level by an average of 6 metres (19.6 feet).
After a decade of satellite measurements the ice sheet surface have shown that the portion of the ice sheet that drains into the Amundsen Sea is thinning at rates of several centimetres to several metres per year.
Several neighbouring glacier basins appear to be behaving in a similar fashion, and thinning is most concentrated on the fast-moving parts of those glaciers, suggesting that this is the result of a dynamic change in the ice sheet itself rather than a change in snowfall.
The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is drained by surprisingly large, fast, river-like currents of ice flowing through the ice sheet.
These ice streams, as they are called, are up to 100 kilometres wide and several hundred kilometres in length, moving at rates as fast as several hundred meters per year.
Studies have shown that the ice streams are underlain by a water-saturated, unconsolidated sediment layer a few meters thick.
This sediment acts to lubricate the ice streams so that they flow rapidly over their beds.
The size and speed of the streams lead to the possibility of rapid collapse of the ice sheet.
NASA scientists and leading climate advisers to the US government, are worried and have said, "Once a sheet starts to disintegrate, it can reach a tipping point beyond which break-up is explosively rapid.
"
Research is continuing and the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Program is an interdisciplinary program developed to study this ice sheet, understand the processes important to its behaviour, and develop models to predict its future behaviour.
Recent studies suggest a possible connection between the subglacial geology and the presence of the ice streams.
In fact, measurements of ice thickness, magnetics, and gravity, made using a specially equipped aircraft, have shown that there is evidence for high heat flow and active volcanism near the ice streams.
These elements could explain the high degree of subglacial melting and lubrication of the sediment under the ice streams.
This work demonstrates the importance of subglacial geology for a complete understanding of the stability of the west Antarctic ice sheet, its ice streams, and its potential for raising global sea level.
WAIS Divide is a United States deep ice coring project in West Antarctica funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and is the second component to the larger WAISCORES initiative.
The purpose of the WAIS Divide project is to collect a deep ice core from the flow divide in central West Antarctica in order to develop a unique series of interrelated climate, ice dynamics, and biologic records focused on understanding interactions among global earth systems.
- the role of Antarctica in abrupt climate change; - the relationship among northern, tropical, and southern climates;
- the stability of the West Antarctic ice sheet; and the biological signals contained in deep ice cores.
Ocean acidification: The scientific community are becoming increasingly worried about this development, which is a direct result of the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.
Absorption rates can vary, but approximately 40% of global anthropogenic (human) carbon dioxide emissions remain in the atmosphere, the rest is taken up by vegetation on land or absorbed by the world’s oceans, currently in about equal proportions.
Ocean acidification caused by increased carbon dioxide uptake by the oceans is expected to reduce surface ocean pH by 0.3 – 0.5 units over the next century, which would be the largest change in pH to occur in the last 20-200 million years.
We know that the carbon dioxide is a direct result of burning fossil fuels, as unlike the make up of living organisms, fossil fuels contain little or none of the radioactive form of carbon, that is, the carbon 14 isotope, which has eight neutrons in the nucleus rather than the usual six.
Fossil fuels also display a unique ratio of the two stable isotopes of carbon (carbon 12 and 13).
The combustion of these fuels thus leaves a distinctive isotopic signature in the atmosphere.
So no one can question where the growing surplus of carbon dioxide comes from.
The Royal Society of London published a report Ocean acidification in 2005, which summarised the salient points:
1.
Carbon dioxide from the atmosphere dissolves in the ocean making it more acidic.
2.
This is inevitable with high carbon dioxide, no fancy models are involved.
4.
Acidification will kill corals, and destroy other marine life.
Increases In Carbon Dioxide Leads To Ocean Acidification
There is equilibrium between atmospheric carbon dioxide and carbon dioxide (CO2) dissolved in seawater: as atmospheric levels increase, so do the levels of CO2 dissolved in the ocean waters, especially in the surface waters where most ocean life flourishes.
Each day millions of tons of CO2 are dissolved in seawater, reacting to form carbonic acid (H2CO3).
This reaction lowers the pH, which is indicative of rising acidity.
Evidence indicates that emissions of carbon dioxide from human activities over the past 200 years have already led to a reduction in the average pH of surface seawater of 0.1 units and could fall by 0.5 units by the year 2100.
This pH is probably lower than has been experienced for hundreds of millennia and, critically, at a rate of change probably 100 times greater than at any time over this period.
This is potentially disastrous as common marine organisms, such as the fish we use as food, may be unable to survive.
NOAA scientists (2006) have indicated that pH is decreasing and there are increases in dissolved inorganic carbon in surface waters over a large section of the north-eastern Pacific.
"The pH decrease is direct evidence of ocean acidification in the Pacific Ocean," said NOAA scientist Richard Feely.
"These dramatic changes can be attributed, in most part, to anthropogenic CO2 uptake by the ocean over the past 15 years.
This verifies earlier model projections that the oceans are becoming more acidic because of the uptake of carbon dioxide released as a result of fossil fuel burning.
"
Some of the most abundant lifeforms that could be affected by ocean acidification are a type of phytoplankton called coccolithophorids, which are covered with small plates of calcium carbonate and are commonly found floating near the surface of the ocean (where they use the abundant sunlight for photosynthesis).
Other important examples are planktonic organisms called foraminifera (which are related to amoeba) and pteropods (small marine snails).
Experiments carried out at sea have shown that the shells of live pteropods dissolve when seawater reaches corrosive levels.
Ocean acidification is detrimental to high-latitude ecosystems and highly acidic conditions could develop within decades, not centuries as suggested previously.
A fall in the numbers of pteropods could cause a chain reaction since they make up the basic food for organisms from zooplankton to whales, as well as for species that are important commercially, such as North Pacific salmon.
For example, the plankton on which cod larvae feed would disappear, and the cod would then go too, and something else not linked heavily to the food chain - like jellyfish - will move into their niche in the ecosystem.
Coral Reefs, which are viewed as the ocean's rain forests because of their amazing biological diversity are also threatened by acidification.
About a quarter of all ocean species spend at least part of their life cycle on reefs.
Calcium carbonate is essential for the development of coral, and it also provides a habitat for deep-sea fish, eels, crabs, sea urchins, etc, while the external skeleton of sea urchins is also directly threatened by acidification.
This outcome is due to both sea temperatures rises, which bleaches coral , and rising ocean acidity.
(Warmer seawaters make corals suffer thermal stress; eventually making them bleach and die.
)
It has been estimated that up to 80% of the coral coverage in the Caribbean has already been lost in the last 30 years (also affected by pollution and overfishing ).
Continuing along the path of burning fossil fuels and releasing millions of tons each day of carbon dioxide which is absorbed by the oceans, will have impacts on marine ecosystems that will be direct, profound and irreversible.
Ocean acidification is essentially irreversible during our lifetimes.
It will take tens of thousands of years for ocean chemistry to return to a condition similar to that occurring at pre-industrial times (about 200 years ago).
Our ability to reduce ocean acidification through artificial methods such as the addition of chemicals is unproven.
These techniques will at best be effective only at a very local scale, and could also cause damage to the marine environment.
Reducing CO2 emissions to the atmosphere is the only practical way to minimise the risk of large-scale and long term changes to the oceans.
In its most significant vote on global warming in two years, the United States Senate on Thursday upheld the Environmental Protection Agency’s right to regulate greenhouse gases ( Christian Science Monitor , AP ).
Which is to say that senators who have been unable to find their way forward on global warming elected not to interfere with President Barack Obama's right to act on their behalf.
Fifty-three senators voted against a resolution by Alaska Republican Lisa Murkowski to effectively overturn EPA's finding that greenhouse gases pose a threat to public health.
That finding, spurred by a Supreme Court decision declaring carbon dioxide a pollutant, serves as a necessary precursor to any greenhouse gas regulations (see our previous coverage here for more detail).
In truth, the resolution never stood a chance.
It wouldn't have made it through the House of Representatives let alone past Obama’s veto (overriding a veto requires a two-thirds vote in both chambers, which would be even more difficult than passing climate legislation).
Nonetheless, the vote was important symbolically, and those pushing for action on global warming fought hard to ensure its defeat.
The Pew Center on Global Climate Change illustrated why in its analysis of the vote: In addition to 53 who voted against the resolution, eight senators who voted for the measure – including five Republicans - expressed their desire for greenhouse gas regulations.
Add up those numbers and you get 61 senators who voiced support for regulating greenhouse gases in some fashion.
Democrats will need 60 votes to get climate legislation through the Senate.
That said, the path forward is not at all clear.
Virtually everybody agrees with the notion that Congress - not the EPA - should design greenhouse gas regulations, but that doesn't mean everybody agrees on how to go about doing so.
South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham, who had been working with Democrats on the leading climate legislation until he broke away last month, muddied the waters further yesterday when he backed a Republican alternative .
Democrats are still aiming for a climate vote this summer, and nobody is willing to say the game is over.
But many think it increasingly likely that Obama will have to exercise his Senate-sanctioned authority to unilaterally institute climate controls, which the EPA expects to begin rolling out next year.
You may have been hearing about the contretemps regarding emails to and from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) of the University of East Anglia.
I have no particular desire now, frankly, to get into all the allegations, counter-allegations, etc., etc.
that have been flying around in the news, the blogosphere and beyond.
There is a discussion - more like a ping pong match - on this under one of my posts here if you want to see my perspective and some others.
I will, however, quote for you what I have quoted before, from a recent editorial in the “FT” .
Here’s what I think is the heart of the matter: “The most important point to make about the leaked correspondence is that it does not undermine the scientific case for cutting emissions of carbon dioxide to fight climate change, which is growing more rather than less compelling.
None of the e-mails seized on by sceptics shows manipulation of the science itself.”
With that in mind, let’s step back and take a look at the science.
There is no more lucid and succinct explanation of the science and practice of collecting and analyzing global temperature records than this from Dr. Peter Stott at the UK’s Met Office.
He explains that there are three centers, working independently and using different methods, that gather and calculate the temperature data: the Met Office, in collaboration with the CRU, NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), and the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC), which is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
These centers receive tens of thousands of temperature observations that are taken across the globe, on land and at sea, every day.
Considerable care is taken in the quality assurance for these observations.
The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has used this data, among others, to produce its conclusions on global temperature.
(The IPCC shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Al Gore in 2007, as you may remember.
) Here is a graph from the Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC in 2007.
Figure SPM.4.
Comparison of observed continental- and global-scale changes in surface temperature with results simulated by climate models using either natural or both natural and anthropogenic forcings.
Decadal averages of observations are shown for the period 1906-2005 (black line) plotted against the centre of the decade and relative to the corresponding average for the period 1901-1950.
Lines are dashed where spatial coverage is less than 50%.
Blue shaded bands show the 5 to 95% range for 19 simulations from five climate models using only the natural forcings due to solar activity and volcanoes.
Red shaded bands show the 5 to 95% range for 58 simulations from 14 climate models using both natural and anthropogenic forcings.
Figure SPM.2.
Locations of significant changes in data series of physical systems (snow, ice and frozen ground; hydrology; and coastal processes) and biological systems (terrestrial, marine and freshwater biological systems), are shown together with surface air temperature changes over the period 1970-2004.
A subset of about 29,000 data series was selected from about 80,000 data series from 577 studies.
These met the following criteria: (1) ending in 1990 or later; (2) spanning a period of at least 20 years; and (3) showing a significant change in either direction, as assessed in individual studies.
These data series are from about 75 studies (of which about 70 are new since the TAR) and contain about 29,000 data series, of which about 28,000 are from European studies.
White areas do not contain sufficient observational climate data to estimate a temperature trend.
The 2 × 2 boxes show the total number of data series with significant changes (top row) and the percentage of those consistent with warming (bottom row) for (i) continental regions: North America (NAM), Latin America (LA), Europe (EUR), Africa (AFR), Asia (AS), Australia and New Zealand (ANZ), and Polar Regions (PR) and (ii) global-scale: Terrestrial (TER), Marine and Freshwater (MFW), and Global (GLO).
The numbers of studies from the seven regional boxes (NAM, EUR, AFR, AS, ANZ, PR) do not add up to the global (GLO) totals because numbers from regions except Polar do not include the numbers related to Marine and Freshwater (MFW) systems.
Locations of large area marine changes are not shown on the map.
“The most important point to make about the leaked correspondence is that it does not undermine the scientific case for cutting emissions of carbon dioxide to fight climate change, which is growing more rather than less compelling.
None of the e-mails seized on by sceptics shows manipulation of the science itself.”
There are many questions and facts “true believers” of “global warming” conveniently ignore or are unable to answer.
And when the do answer it is typically behind vague and unproved assertions like “most scientists agree”.
Regardless I think we can all safely agree that weather patterns and climate are changing.I don’t think the current science or data illustrates what is causing the weather change or whether or what “normal” weather patterns or climate are.
Perhaps lower temperatures from prior years were an anomaly and current weather is “normal” And how accurate are our derived temperatures from anything older than 150 years ago?
Can they be proven?
And more importantly, much (all?
) of the predictive weather change is based on a variety of “models” - “models” are also what weather forecasters, hedge fudge managers, portfolio analysts and gamblers use in attempts to predict future events based on past results, all to eventual failure because of the untested assumptions, factors and inputs inherent in any model - climate change models are no different.
And lastly, the most troubling aspects regarding climate change is the scientific hubris that we can “fix” the changes with more “science”, like cloud seeding or co2 sequestering or high-altitude reflectors or… trust me, we aren’t that smart to have figured out the intended or unintended consequences.
What all of you folks yelling about the CRU emails and data are overlooking is that this is one piece of the puzzle on climate change that thousands of scientists are putting together.
Should these folks who wrote these emails have tried to fudge the data?
Absolutely not!
But complain loud and long when you find a few thousand, or even a few hundred emails over a period of several years talking about fudging data.
These folks at the CRU are such a tiny drop in the bucket compared with all of the tens of thousands of people researching this, that your hysteria is ridiculous.
It’s like saying that because one car was broken into in your neighborhood you have a major crime spree going on.
Context, put these emails in context.

Njcons - Actually, I thought the video made a perfectly convincing argument regarding the use of the term “trick” with scientists.
In any event, I can sit here and type until the cows come home and there’s not one thing I can say to convince you that the climate scientists are right.
The problem lies in that we see the world differently.
I mentioned George Lakoff once in this context.
No, he’s not a climate scientist.
(But neither are Limbaugh, Beck or any of those other vicious bloviators, nor you, for that matter, I daresay.
) Lakoff is a cognitive scientist, meaning he looks at how people think.
You think, in a word, differently than I do, and, thankfully, the real world’s scientists, business leaders, government policymakers, and environmentalists also see things differently than you do.
Chris Mooney has written The Republican War on Science .
It talks about why folks like Inhofe and Morano, Limbaugh, Beck, the old Bush administration climate deniers and the like - you too?
- are terrified of the science.
Sceptic (You must be British, based on the spelling.
) - Okay, not only do we agree that geoengineering is crazy, but also that there is warming.
We’re getting somewhere.
Is the rapidly accelerating rate of warming normal?
No. Assessments based on the instrumental records and the work done with proxies indicate we’re seeing some seriously abnormal warming.
I would refer you to the excellent work done at Skeptical Science, this, for instance, on What does past climate change tell us?
There’s also this Historical Overview of Climate Change Science from the IPCC’s AR4.
We certainly can’t err, can we, in the vigorous, full-throated pursuit of energy efficiency, renewables, green building, “cool” farming, prevention of deforestation and forest degradation (not to mention promoting reforestation), and generally lessening our massive environmental and economic burdens?
There has also been a significant difference in satellite versus surface station temperatures.
I have no regard for the value of surface station data as it exists now only as adjusted data with very poor quality control, and I prefer open source technology that allows anyone with skill to track ocean heat content as a true indicator of a warming planet.
Access to climate scientific data and methods has to become all open sourced before it can be trusted.
In 1999, a U.S. National Research Council panel was commissioned to study the state of the U.S. climate observing systems and issued a report entitled “Adequacy of Climate Observing Systems”
The panel was chaired by Dr. Tom Karl, director of the National Climatic Center, and Dr. James Hansen, lead climate researcher at NASA GISS.
That panel concluded:
“The 1997 Conference on the World Climate Research Programme to the Third Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change concluded that the ability to monitor the global climate was inadequate and deteriorating.”
“Scientific analysis of the issues relative to detecting climate change, attributing causes to that change, and evaluating the consequences of projected climate change all require a robust, credible climate observing system.
Observing systems are in place that partially fulfill the requirements for meeting these objectives, but the continued viability of some of these systems is questionable.
Without immediate action to prevent the deterioration of some essential observing systems, the ability of the climate research community to provide over the next decade the objective scientific information required for informed decision making will be seriously compromised.”
As far as Dr. Stott, he may be ill-informed, but I think he is a flat out liar.
I say this because he is held out as a “climate expert”.
National Climatic Data Center (US) – Part of the National Oceanic And Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
The Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) is a database of temperature, precipitation and pressure records managed by the National Climatic Data Center, Arizona State University and the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center.
“Almost all the data we have in the CRU archive is exactly the same as in the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) archive used by the NOAA National Climatic Data Center.
The merged land air and sea surface temperature anomaly analysis is based on data from the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) of land temperatures and the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS) of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data.
Kid - I didn’t want you to think I’d forgotten you.
I often have to juggle several balls - as do most of us.
In any event, I believe that your concern regarding keeping the climate science updated and in line with the best technology available is shared by the highest echelons of American science.
NOAA’s National Climatic Data Center is engaged in maintaining an existing network of monitoring stations and rolling out a new network.
See this from them.
Certainly they look at how they’ve been monitoring and analyzing data.
See this paper for instance: Improvements to NOAA’s Historical Merged Land–Ocean Surface Temperature Analysis (1880–2006) .
Beyond this, the National Academy of Science and other federal agencies came out with a report this year: Restructuring Federal Climate Research to Meet the Challenges of Climate Change .
But the crux of the “true believers” argument ultimately rests with “well, the science may not be proven right, but it can’t be bad to act now”, or as you stated, “We certainly can’t err, can we, in the vigorous, full-throated pursuit of energy efficiency, renewables, green building, “cool” farming, prevention of deforestation and forest degradation (not to mention promoting reforestation), and generally lessening our massive environmental and economic burdens?”
I reviewed the material you referenced, and aside from being rather boring, it is far from conclusive.
While it does make a solid case for observed climate change, the linking of climate change to human activity is much more tenuous.
1) the data used to generate the charts and respective conclusions categorize the miriad of environmental impacts as statistically significant or not significant “according to the author of each paper”.
So how do I attribute validirty to tthe original author’s assessment (or not)?
2) the climate observations themselves are identified as changes consistent with warming, changes consistent with cooling or an observation of no change, with the majority of observations claassified as “changes consistent with warming”.
We are there any observations of changes consistent with cooling?
Or is it possible that weather and climate are complex and we don’t undersrtand it as well as we think we do.
Lastly, and this has been raised before, one of the problems with climate change studies is that many (most?
) studies are based on the same underlying data or are based on conclusions from the same underlying data - the conclusions reached in the original material are self-perpetuating because no new information is incorporated.
It’s like me offering a review of a book based on your review of the book - it would be hard for the two views to differ…
So the fact that there has been (perhaps) warming over recent decades of a couple of degrees means what?
Is there ANY reason to believe it isn’t 100% natural?
The “scientists” themselves tell us that some of the warmest years of the century occurred in the 1930’s.
It’s cooled over the last decade…what does that mean?
Should we extrapolate this cooling and prepare for a new ice-age?
Is this the way science works?
As I previously asked, how can one assess the validity of an author’s study that categorizes impacts as significant or not significant without a statistical basis to confirm the author’s assessment?
Would that not potentially jeopardize the conclusions based on unverified assessments?
And why are there still statistically significant observations (>25%) of changes consistent with cooling?
Shouldn’t we only observe changes consistent with warming if “climate change” is as big a threat as presented by you or your colleagues?
njcons - “The year 2009 is likely to rank in the top 10 warmest on record since the beginning of instrumental climate records in 1850, according to data sources compiled by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).” See the press release from them titled: 2000–2009, THE WARMEST DECADE .
Glaciers melting?
Perhaps in the northern hemisphere…but not in the southern hemisphere.
There is a long history of regional variances…suggesting that the current activity is occuring naturally.
And glaciers are effected as much by precipitation as they are by temps.
The alarmers are telling us that every time the wind blows it’s due to global warming….as if we never exerienced extreme weather in the past.
But the data suggest otherwise.
But more importantly, your illustration of the Bolivian glacier is a perfect example of how glaciers are impacted by many variables other than temps.
Precipitation, cloud cover, and solar activity can have huge impacts on the changing size of glaciers.
Okay, but the entirety of the Andean glacial mass is diminishing.
See this article from IPS and this report from the World Bank.
The World Bank reports “Since 1970, glaciers in the Andes have lost 20 percent of their volume, according to a report by Peru’s National Meteorology and Hydrology Service (SENAMHI).” “Skeptical Science,” not one of your key sources I daresay, notes here that “Globally, glaciers are shrinking in area and thickness and the melt rate has accelerated dramatically since the mid-1990s.
The National Snow and Ice Data Center have calculated global change in glacier volume - their results show glaciers are shrinking at an alarming rate.” Local conditions in all cases?
The thawing of the Arctic sea ice and permafrost, the melting in the Alps, the melting of Kilimanjaro’s snow - all caused by local conditions?
“Now, Chacaltaya is fast disappearing, along with other Andean glaciers, a result of global warming, says Vergara.
“The greenhouse gases are the main driver.
The scientific community has a consensus—this is manmade.”
I just got through showing that without a doubt the Chacaltaya glacier disappearance could not be attributed to warming…since it’s been cooling there.
Your source simply has it wrong.
And what should we make of a 20% decline in the Andes (which includes the massive Chacaltaya glacier)?
If the remainder of the Andean glacial mass has declined 10-15% (pick a number), why wouldn’t this be considered entirely natural?
Surely precipitation levels can vary that much over decades.
And your “skeptical science” link boldly states that glacier growth in the Shastas is due to increased precipitation.
Exactly my point!
If glaciers can grow due to precipitation they can decline due to the lack thereof.
This is another of the alarmists game.
They will tell us that warming increases precipitation levels which lead to increased ice-mass.
They will also tell us that warming diminishes ice mass.
So they’ve conveniently got it covered regardless of what’s happening to ice mass.
Finally, why is it that Arctic sea-ice loss is always raised but Antarctic ice growth is NEVER mentioned?
You’ve got to look at the whole picture.
As to Antarctica, land ice is decreasing and the rate of decrease is accelerating.
Sea ice accumulation is perhaps explained by several factors: the impact of ozone depletion on wind patterns, ocean circulation patterns.
The waters around Antarctica are warming faster than the rest of the world’s oceans, so “global cooling” is not in play.
(See the succinct explanation of this at Skeptical Science.
)
Does underwater volcanic activity explain all of the documented sea surface temperature rise worldwide?
But yes, there is at least one other factor involved in Arctic ice melt: black carbon deposition.
BC is a massive forcing agent , not only in the Arctic, but in the Himalayas and elsewhere.
“Antarctica has 90 per cent of the Earth’s ice and 80 per cent of its fresh water.
Extensive melting of Antarctic ice sheets would be required to raise sea levels substantially, and ice is melting in parts of west Antarctica.
The destabilisation of the Wilkins ice shelf generated international headlines this month.
“Australian Antarctic Division glaciology program head Ian Allison said sea ice losses in west Antarctica over the past 30 years had been more than offset by increases in the Ross Sea region, just one sector of east Antarctica.”
I’m going to talk about four today.
First, the stimulus.
Second, the prospects of climate legislation.
Third, China, and fourth some interesting things that may be happening with regard to global forests and illegal logging.
One word of caution though, since our focus is environment.
I’ve worked on environmental issues in Washington off and on for about thirty years, and it isn’t actually the left that passes environmental legislation.
It hasn’t necessarily always been the left that even most strongly supported environmental legislation.
Environmental legislation has come from the middle.
That’s going to be an important issue in 2009.
They’ll also very likely be early movement on an energy bill that goes far behind what’s possible in the short-term stimulus package for clean energy.
If you looked at the exit polls, everybody in the country was in favor of clean energy.
Over 80 percent said they wanted to see investments in clean energy.
If you looked at the campaign websites of the six or seven new Senators who are taking office, all mentioned a commitment to clean energy and improved energy security.
Very few mentioned climate change.
What will happen with climate change legislation?
All of that’s important, but if you were thinking of making a few billion dollars worth of investments in clean technology, you would be thinking about the markets into which you’d be selling energy in the next ten years.
And it would be important to you to know whether those markets are going to give a premium for clean energy and in some way penalize fossil fuels that emit the carbon dioxide that causes global warming.
There’s pretty broad agreement that we are going to enact global climate change legislation, but not much clarity about when or how fast we’re going to make cuts, and that’s what will shape tomorrow’s markets.
I’ve been astonished working with leaders of companies like GE and Dow and Dupont and Alcoa, the extent to which they just openly acknowledge that markets are going to be shaped by governmental action, and they need the certainty of knowing what the price is going to be of carbon.
I’ve been working on climate change issues in Washington for over ten years.
I have to say right now working on these issues here is like living in three parallel universes.
There’s the universe of the necessary, the universe of the possible and the universe of the probable.
The universe of the necessary is defined by the science.
And I’m not going to show you a whole bunch of science slides.
This is Issues to Watch, not me telling you what the science shows.
This is my favorite temperature chart.
This is an averaging of temperature increase over 150 years, the red line.
The blue line is 100 years.
The orange line is 50 years, and the yellow line is 30 years.
If you follow the science, if you had an RSS feed that gave you the BBC and Science News every day, you would have this strong sense that something is going really, really fast that people don’t get yet.
Everything that we thought we knew five years ago about climate change has been superseded.
All of the trends are going more quickly than we would have predicted.
The temperature increase and the occurrence of consequences are all taking place faster than the models predicted.
That means that our long-range predictions of what might happen are just off.
We just don’t really know, but it’s all going to the high end.
And this is the product of 0.8 degrees centigrade of warming.
We are virtually absolutely committed to two degrees centigrade of warming.
So the necessary is telling us we have to act really quickly, urgently and take significant action.
This is a group of companies who I talked to you about for the last couple of years, the United States Climate Action Partnership, now 27 companies.
Once they had about $3 trillion worth of market cap, who knows what it is now.
But they’re the core of the leadership of American industry.
In January of 2007, they released along with us and several other environmental groups a call for action that completely changed the political dynamic on Capitol Hill of climate change legislation.
Watch what they do in about four weeks.
This is a story about a coal plant that was going to be built in Utah to meet increasing power demands and was turned down by the courts because the federal courts said, well the Supreme Court found that carbon dioxide is a pollutant and the EPA has to decide how to regulate that pollutant under the Clean Air Act.
And they issued this permit for a new coal-fired power plant that will be responsible for millions of tons of CO2 and they never discussed the CO2.
Therefore, the permit was not legally issued.
There was also a state utility commission that did the same thing, saying “Wait a minute, how can you build this thing when we have complete uncertainty about whether you’re going to be able to emit CO2 in another 5 years?
This is nuts.”
But the only piece of climate legislation that has been voted on recently by the United States Senate was the so-called Lieberman-Warner bill, a bill that was in the lower track in those charts I showed you a moment ago.
And those who follow this know that it did not survive a cloture vote, it did not achieve the 60 votes necessary to go to final passage.
Much more importantly, a group of Democratic senators who voted for cloture, voted to move the bill ahead, sent a letter saying, “We would not have voted for this bill on final passage because it creates too many uncertainties for jobs and industry in our states.
We need to see provisions in the bill that assure us that our industry and our jobs are going to be effectively protected.”
The United States Senate was designed by the Constitution to reflect regional issues, that’s why each state regardless of population has two senators and that means that this geographic distribution of coal dependence is an essential political fact as we think about what legislation can pass, and a reflection of why I said at the beginning environmental legislation comes from the middle–in this case the physical middle of the country.
And by the way, for some of these other states where you see a sea of low cost electricity but they weren’t yellow, it’s because they have two Republican senators who have always said they were going to vote against the legislation.
Nothing passes the Senate without meeting the concerns of these members of the Senate.
And they’re not unreasonable or ideological concerns.
They are representative of the people who voted these senators into office.
So a couple of things that I would suggest that you watch as climate bills begin to be introduced in both the House and the Senate.
But that brings me to the third issue that I want to talk about, which is how we deal with China.
Some very interesting trends underway.
There’s a huge amount going on in China with regard to energy and climate change.
If you had gone to China five years ago and tried to have a conversation with top government officials about climate change, you would have gotten a very simply line: “We are not going to impose costs on our economy to solve a problem you created.
It’s your problem, you deal with it.”
That’s just gone.
That is not the case any longer.
There is a massive intellectual focus in China among top officials on what they can do, how they can do it, when they can do it, what the costs are, what are the opportunities are.
And there is an ongoing, real-time commitment to improving efficiency with which they use energy—20% improvement by next year.
And to developing their next five year plan to make much deeper cuts.
And because during the Olympics they took a series of measures to eliminate pollution, including limiting driving in Beijing to alternate days.
They are finding that there’s huge public support for reducing emissions and have allowed a very public debate on whether this alternate day driving scheme should be continued.
In the official press and on the websites of the official press, continuing discussion of, “Isn’t it cool when the traffic isn’t as bad and the sky isn’t as polluted?”
But here’s the key.
The US and China are the axis of emissions.
They’ve recently passed us.
Between us we are something more than 40%, about 44%, of emissions.
We are both dependent on coal, dependent on imported foreign oil.
Countries whose economies have shown high technological capacity and are driven by strong trends of entrepreneurship.
Countries who would like to be selling into tomorrow’s carbon constrained markets.
And if we were to find agreement on dealing with climate change, reflecting our mutual interests in defining and competing for tomorrow’s markets and our capacity to make reductions, the world will move.
If the US and China find agreement, the world will move.
If we do not find agreement, the world cannot go much further.
It is to me, about as clear as that.
So think what you might watch for.
When and who is, does the first trip from the new administration to China?
I would put aside thinking about what happened at Poznan or didn’t.
I told one of you beforehand, I think that people who are disappointed that there wasn’t some sort of agreement at Poznan were just looking for the wrong thing.
You don’t go to a mixer hoping to see a wedding.
This was a mixer, not a wedding ceremony.
Don’t look at that.
Don’t listen to the screams of frustration from negotiators at the various interim meetings that’ll take place over the next twelve months.
Watch who goes to China and what they talk about.
If an agreement between the US and China on climate, technology, clean energy, energy security begins to emerge, that’s a really, really big deal for the hopes of what we can do together.
Last point I want to talk about.
Forests may get more attention in the coming year, for a variety of reasons.
We all know because of work that has been done by people like Tom [Lovejoy] for decades that forests are incredibly important as natural systems, as storehouses of biodiversity, as the key to a variety of ecosystem services from water supply to nutrient cycling to above all right now, control of CO2.
Deforestation is now responsible for something between 15% to 20% of all greenhouse gas emissions globally, and the international negotiations are focusing on how to control emissions from deforestation.
If you look to the places where there’s likely to be an effort to find some way to control deforestation through a climate agreement, they all fit right within those big red splotches, which is why I find this Lacey Act possibility so interesting.
Q: I have a couple of questions on the China front.
Do you think because Steven Chu is Chinese-American that that gives him some special ability to be an emissary on climate change?
I know that his announcement made headlines in China.
People were kind of proud of that achievement.
Also, do you think it’s true that the rumors and rumblings here that a climate bill might include some trade restrictions on goods from China, if China did not take action to reduce their emissions, that that had some effect?
That that’s partly why China is showing a greater inclination to do some of these things,?
That they didn’t want to be in this situation where the rest of the world was limiting import of their goods?
And if so, is that become a tool that we should exploit further?
LASH: I hope the answer to the first is yes.
It’s speculation, you can speculate as well as I do, but the key question is, do we put it to the test?
How soon does he go and begin talking to the Chinese and will that be a delegate?
Maybe the Vice President and the Secretary of Energy and the Climate Czar go sometime in February or March.
That would be a terrific sign.
I don’t think that the policies I’m talking about are a reflection of the debate over imposing some sort of a penalty in climate legislation.
First, they’d started earlier and seemed to initially reflect China’s concern of about the environmental consequences, of its energy use, and more importantly, its energy dependence.
JONATHAN PERSHING : I was in China about three weeks ago, and at that point in time, the conversation had already been fairly far advanced in the US Senate with respect to some of the discussions on protectionist structures.
They’re not focused on that.
They hate them, they don’t want them, they’re going to push back on them in ways that they can.
But that’s not driving policy.
Policy’s being driven, which we talked to them, by number one, an energy security concern.
Number two, a local pollution concern.
And number three, and I think Jonathan mentioned this, the climate change concern because the damages there look pretty ferocious.
Q: There were three tracks, and you mentioned the China-US track, on climate change.
There’s of course the ongoing meetings, the UN meetings, over the course of the year.
And the domestic, what happens here domestically.
And everyone is pointing towards Copenhagen at the end of next year as reaching a final deal, although that may look problematic.
Do you think those tracks will come together in time for there to be a legitimate shot at a final deal?
LASH: I think it is possible.
I don’t think that what the Congress does is going to be driven by the Copenhagen schedule.
There hasn’t been much history of the Congress being willing to respond to international pressures.
I do think it is possible, though not likely, that climate legislation will pass both houses within the next twelve months.
And I do think it’s possible that US engagement in the process and US engagement with key nations will build the basis for an agreement in Copenhagen.
But it’s impossible to say yes it will happen, no it won’t happen.
It’s not time yet.
LASH: If there is a member of Congress who has expertise and history on these issues, it’s Henry Waxman.
Henry Waxman is a real legislator.
He has had his name on a lot of very important pieces of environmental legislation over thirty years or more.
And he has always shown the ability to figure out where the votes are that are necessary to get legislation through.
Everything that I hear suggests that he is looking for what the package is that can pass both his new committee and on the floor of the House.
I think a very interesting question will be the extent to which that legislation becomes a close reflection of the preferences of the new White House.
I suspect that when Henry introduces a bill, it will be somewhere in the center, and it will have taken into account the questions of how do you assure members that the costs imposed on the economy will not be extreme.
CHRISTINA DECONCINI : I would just also say that is going to be very important, what Mr. Waxman does in his committee.
And he has laid out a group of principles with 152 cosponsors in the House of what he thinks should be in the climate bill, and has given that to Speaker Pelosi and that’s been circulated widely.
Those are very, very progressive principles.
And he serves as a chairman now of a committee that isn’t very left-leaning and very progressive.
So the politics of it are going to be very, very tricky.
It’s pretty hard to imagine how you would get that committee to vote on a bill with those principles.
But he is also serving at the pleasure of Nancy Pelosi, as all the folks are, and she is the leader and there are a lot of different political maneuverings that you could see happening.
I don’t really want to predict that they will happen, of how you could get that kind of bill to the floor.
You could do it without going through the committee, I’m not suggesting that that will happen, but that is a possibility.
Or you could, as Jonathan was saying, start with a more moderate bill and maybe be able to figure out how to get that through committee.
So it’s tricky because while it’s a significant change that he’s the leader and where he is on this issue from where Mr. Dingell has been, the committee hasn’t completely changed just because he’s taken over leadership of it.
So I definitely think that’s going to be something to watch.
And I also think that it’s likely that his committee will move first before the Senate.
And I think that’s a positive thing and I mean, I hope that’s the way it happens.
I think folks are hoping that the House does move first on climate legislation.
LASH: I think the most significant thing was the creation of a very strong position in the White House to coordinate energy and climate policy.
That represents a structural statement about both the importance they’re giving to the issue and their understanding that you have to connect the dots in order to do this policy.
And they selected someone to manage that office who has tremendous experience and a very strong reputation as being able to get things done in Washington.
So that was a strong signal.
Carol Browner is a great pick for that job.
LASH: Absolutely, jobs and economic recovery are topic one, it’s going to be a discussion of compelling importance.
If there is climate and energy legislation, it will be climate and energy legislation that among other things is designed to invest in jobs, create the technology of tomorrow and build future markets.
I will also ask my colleague Jonathan Pershing to comment, but I thought that the ultimate deal in the EU was actually not a serious step back.
They had to deal with a set of coal-dependent countries who have lower standards of living.
They made a few adjustments to take care of them but they didn’t step off their fundamental commitment to reduce emissions and they made a huge commitment to spending on carbon capture and storage and new technologies to move ahead.
So I did not see that as a big loss.
MOUNT SHASTA, Calif. — Global warming is shrinking glaciers all over the world, but the seven tongues of ice creeping down Mount Shasta's flanks are a rare exception: They are the only known glaciers in the continental U.S. that are growing.
Climate change has cut the number of glaciers at Montana's Glacier National Park from 150 to 26 since 1850, and some scientists project there will be none left within a generation.
On the mountain, precipitation falls as snow, adding to the glaciers enough to overcome a 1.8 degree Fahrenheit rise in temperature in the last century, scientists say.
The Sierra's 498 ice formations — glaciers and ice fields — have shrunk by about half their size over the past 100 years, said Andrew Fountain, a geology professor at Portland State University.
He inventoried glaciers in the continental U.S. as part of a federal initiative.
Although Mount Shasta's glaciers are growing, researchers say the 4.7 billion cubic feet of ice on its flanks could be gone by 2100.
The Shasta glaciers have been advancing since the end of a drought in the early 20th century.
The mountain's smallest glaciers — named Konwakiton, Watkins and Mud Creek — have more than doubled in length since 1950.
The added ice on Mount Shasta might be good for the state's water supplies.
Hydrologists believe the glaciers feed springs and aquifers, though they say it's unclear precisely how the water travels underground.
Until recently, the same phenomenon that is benefiting Shasta's glaciers was feeding glacier growth in southern Norway and Sweden, the New Zealand Alps and northern Pakistan, according to the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
In each area, scientists say, more snowfall temporarily offset warming temperatures in the 1990s and early 2000s.
But rising temperatures since then have begun to shrink the ice.
Climate change is causing roughly 90 percent of the world's mountain glaciers to shrink, said Thompson, the Ohio State glacier expert.
"Best that we keep our eye on the big picture," Thompson said in an e-mail about Shasta's unique position.
"The picture points unfortunately (to) massive loss of ice on land, which has huge implications for future sea level rise.
"
At that rate, California's snowpack and its remaining glaciers are among the most vulnerable of its natural resources.
Even without global warming, another threat to Shasta's glaciers could come far more quickly: a volcanic eruption could melt them, creating mud flows that could bury the surrounding small communities.
The U.S. EPA has given state officials in Ohio until 2010 to bring ozone leves in the northeast part of the state into acceptable ranges.
The problem?
Most of the ozone causing pollutants are generated
The state’s top environmental official says it will be impossible for eight northeastern Ohio counties to meet new, stricter ground-level ozone standards that the federal government requires by 2010.
"You could do all kinds of Draconian things in northeast Ohio and it wouldn’t matter," Joe Koncelik, director of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, said Friday.
The eight counties produce about one-third of the pollutants that lead to the region’s unhealthy levels of groundlevel ozone, Koncelik said.
The rest comes from other parts of Ohio and neighboring states.
This is a classic case of a transboundary externality.
Because of the jetstream, pollutants generated in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois and Indiana generate ozone in Ohio--just like sulfur dioxide emissions in Ohio generate acid rain in New England.
State level regulation, or better put, state level accountability cannot efficiently solve regional externality problems.

blog). That is a very nice service to the profession.
Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner are the latest to do it, in their new book Superfreakonomics .
Their chapter on climate change sits awkwardly with the rest of their work; the original Freakonomics was based on Levitt’s academic work, real data and models the authors used to make ostentatiously counterintuitive points about perverse economic incentives.
But Levitt did no original work on climate.
The chapter’s not about economic incentives.
There’s no evidence of deep or sustained engagement with the literature or previous research on the subject.
The authors just high-stepped in, cast a cursory glance around, and started condescending to the people involved in it (and stepping on rakes ).
Why?
What leads people to think that entire areas of climate science and policy, the subject of close study by thousands of very smart people all over the globe every day, can be overturned with facile points of logic and Silver Bullets Nobody’s Thought Of?
I read the section of the climate change chapter on negative externalities.
It is good, except for one thing.
I don't get how a stray bullet, intended for a drug dealer, that hits an innocent bystander is a negative externality.
Negative externalities are the result of voluntary transactions that harm someone not participating in the transaction.
Next up is the geoengineering section!
May I suggest that if you should happen to need some friendly help next time you take on the topic of climate change, or would like to have a chat about why aerosol geoengineering might not be a cure-all, or just need a critical but informed opponent to bounce ideas off of, you don’t have to go very far.
For example…
I finished reading the prostitution chapter (it was great, but "patriotic prostitutes"?
that's a reach) and the global cooling section of the climate change chapter.
I must agree with the critics, it really does present global cooling as the scientific consensus, implying that the current scientific consensus might be just as nutty.
If you disagree with the thrust of the SuperFreakonomics climate change chapter, are you a global warming fanatic ?
Here is the Freakonomics blog post in my Google Reader:
[Steve Levitt] wondered if he was in for a Jim Cramer-type beatdown.
But it turns out that Jon Stewart doesn't appreciate the global-warming fanatics either, and gave SuperFreakonomics a thumping endorsement.
RESECON readers are invited to a Union of Concerned Scientists' event, "Taking Action on Climate Change: An Economists' Weekend," in Chicago, IL.
The event will start with dinner on Friday, November 13, and continue until 4PM on Sunday, November 15, 2009.
The weekend is open to PhD and PhD candidate economists.
Because all roads to climate action lead through the US Midwest, we particularly welcome participants from MN, MI, IA, OH, IL, WI, and MO.
...
Do you care about climate change?
Would you like to contribute to finding solutions to address it?
Join us and fellow economists for a two-day workshop featuring a skills-building session on communicating with the media and legislators, an overview of the current federal climate policy landscape, and discussion on how economists can effectively and strategically call for strong policy.
At the end of the weekend, you will be able to choose from a number of ways to add your voice to debate.
Dr. Michael Hanemann, Professor of Economics from the University of California, Berkeley will be joining us for an address on Friday evening and a session on Saturday on how economists can contribute to the policy discussion on climate change and clean energy.
Finding solutions for climate change is a top priority for UCS.
We already work with climate scientists all over the U.S. and are eager to engage similarly with economists.
We want to learn from your research and analysis, as well as to share our policy-relevant expertise.
Please note that we seek your knowledge and interest, rather than your endorsement of any particular policy or piece of legislation.
Climate change presents a global crisis, but "can also provide an economic opportunity of vast proportions," Dan Reicher, director of climate change initiatives at Google told the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.
I received SuperFreakonomics: Global Cooling, etc in the mail yesterday and plan to read the climate change chapter tonight while watching The Office reruns on TBS .
But, I'm wondering, should I wait for the second edition?
Levitt, a University of Chicago economist, said he does not believe there is a cooling trend.
He said the line was just an attempt to note the irony of a cool couple of years at a time of intense discussion of global warming.
Levitt said he did not do any statistical analysis of temperatures, but "eyeballed" the numbers and noticed 2005 was hotter than the last couple of years.
Levitt said the "cooling" reference in the book title refers more to ideas about trying to cool the Earth artificially.
Just weeks before an international conference on climate change, the United Nations signaled it was scaling back expectations of reaching agreement on a new treaty to slow global warming.
Have you taken the Freakonomics global warming quiz ?
It involves a series of True/False questions that are designed to get the reader to agree with the SuperFreakonomics climate chapter.
"Uncertain" is not a possible answer even when we get to the technological questions.
Such as:
There exists an engineering design that provides a means of delivering enough sulfur dioxide to the stratosphere on a continuous basis to effectively cool the Earth.
The estimated cost of building and implementing this technology is a few hundred million dollars.
Note: I still haven't received my copy of SuperFreak and so still haven't read the climate chapter.
These comments are based entirely (or, at least 95%) on my reading of the post link above.
From the Sunday NYTimes comes the details ( Senate Global Warming ...):
The Senate bill aimed at reducing global warming pollution will initially grant billions of dollars of free emissions permits to utilities and industry but will require the bulk of the money be returned to consumers and taxpayers, according to newly released details.
The bill will also provide a cushion to energy-intensive manufacturing companies to ease the transition to a lower-carbon economy and to help them compete internationally, although the subsidies will disappear over time.
The measure also sets a floor and ceiling on the price of permits to emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
With these and other changes considered, the Environmental Protection Agency estimates that overall cost of the bill at roughly $100 a year per household, similar to that of a House climate change and energy bill passed in June.
The Senate measure, sponsored by Senators John Kerry of Massachusetts and Barbara Boxer of California, both Democrats, aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions under a cap-and-trade system that sets a nationwide limit on emissions but allows polluters to buy and sell permits to meet it.
The latest version includes new financing for research on capturing and storing carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, more money for low-carbon transportation projects, additional assistance for rural communities and more favorable treatment for agriculture and forestry.
“We’ve reached another milestone as we move to a clean energy future,” Mrs. Boxer said in a statement, “creating millions of jobs and protecting our children from dangerous pollution.”

The Sahara Desert is the world's second largest desert (Antarctica is the largest) and is located in northern Africa.
It stretches from the Red Sea to the highlands of Ethiopia.
However, the Sahara encompasses regions significantly different from an ecological perspective.
The surface of the desert ranges from large areas of sand dunes (which are called erg), to stone plateaus (hamadas), gravel plains (reg), dry valleys (wadis), and salt flats.
The northern and southern margins also receive more rainfall and have greater vegetation than central Sahara.
The very scarce rain (less than 25 mm and even less than 5 mm per annum in the east) can fall in any season and in a very irregular way : some areas may receive no rain for years then suffer intense storms.
Some areas encompass vast underground aquifers resulting in oases, while other regions severely lack water reserves.
Some mountains (Ahaggar, Tassili N’Ajier, Tibesti, Aïr) also rise up in the desert and receive more rainfall and mostly present slightly cooler summer temperatures.
The Sahara occupies approximately 10 percent of the African Continent and is one of the hottest regions in the world, with mean annual temperatures exceeding 30°C.
In the hottest months, temperatures can rise over 50°C, and temperatures can fall below freezing in the winter.
A single daily variation of -0.5°C to 37.5°C has been recorded.
The Sahara is also extremely windy.
Hot, dust-filled winds create dust devils, which can make the temperatures seem even hotter.
The extreme aridity of this area is a relatively recent feature.
Much larger areas of the Sahara had adequate water only 5000 to 6000 years ago.
It is not clear how much of this ecoregion was covered with vegetation, but in other parts of the Sahara the vegetation was closer to the savannah woodlands of eastern and southern Africa.
It is reported that in the region south of the Sahara Desert, 1.5 million hectares of land turn is becoming barren every year, with the Sahara expanding in a southward direction.
Africa is increasingly vulnerable to the impact of climate change, easily seen in Ethiopia and Rwanda.
SACRAMENTO — California became the first state to declare secondhand smoke a toxic air pollutant Thursday, citing its link to breast cancer.
Experts said the decision may have more impact worldwide than it does in the largely smoke-free state.
The decision by the California Air Resources Board puts environmental tobacco smoke in the same category as diesel exhaust, arsenic and benzene.
Scientific studies in recent years have warned about the health impact from second-hand smoke and linked it to a wide array of ailments including heart disease, lung cancer and other respiratory ailments, as well as breast cancer.
“To actually have the major air pollution agency in the state of California to list ETS (environmental tobacco smoke) as a toxic air contaminant is going to have immense impact, we think, in terms of public education around other states,” he said.
“It will clearly lead to regulatory changes within the state.”
The unanimous decision relied on a September report that found a sharply increased risk of breast cancer in young women exposed to secondhand smoke.
It also links drifting smoke to premature births, asthma and heart disease, other cancers, and numerous health problems in children.
"If people are serious about breast cancer, they have to deal with secondhand smoke.
That's what this is all about," said Dr. Stanton Glantz, director of the Center for Tobacco Control, Research and Education at the University of California, San Francisco.
He reviewed the science behind Thursday's decision.
"This is a seminal, international document.
It's impossible to underestimate what a big deal this is.
"
The report by scientists at California's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment draws on more than 1,000 other studies of the effects of passive smoke.
It blamed secondhand smoke for 4,000 deaths each year in California from lung cancer or heart disease alone.
The most significant new finding is that young women exposed to secondhand smoke increase their risk of developing breast cancer between 68 percent and 120 percent.
The disease kills about 40,000 women in the United States each year.
That finding conflicts with a 2004 report by the U.S. Surgeon General.
Sanford Barsky, a UC, Los Angeles, researcher writing on behalf of the R.J. Reynolds tobacco company, told the board the report "either ignores mentioning or does not give the appropriate weight to studies which refute this association" between secondhand smoke and breast cancer.
R.J. Reynolds spokesman David Howard said regardless of the dangers from passive smoke indoors, no research supports regulators' decision to declare it an air pollutant.
"This is no longer some crazy, California, Left Coast way of thinking," said Cynthia Hallett, executive director of Berkeley-based Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights.
She cited smoking bans that have been enacted or are being considered across the nation and in other countries.
The decision in the California state capital kicks off a process that will likely take two or three years as officials study ways to reduce exposure to second-hand smoke.
In 1994, California became the first U.S. state to bar smoking in the workplace, and then followed up with bans on smoking in restaurants and bars.
Other American cities and states have since adopted similar prohibitions.
Several California cities have enacted wider bans, such as San Francisco, which now prohibits smoking in city parks, and Los Angeles, which bars smoking at piers and beaches.
The effect is likely to be greatest outside of California, which already bans smoking in or near most public buildings, including bars and restaurants.
Much of the initial effort in California will focus on public education emphasizing the scientific findings and Thursday's air board decision, said Paul Knepprath, vice president for government relations at the American Lung Association of California.
The association unsuccessfully pushed legislation in 2003 that would have banned smoking in motor vehicles containing young children, and could try for a similar law next year, Knepprath said.
The association may also push for nonsmoking floors or wings in apartment buildings, much as hotels offer smoke-free areas, Knepprath said.
"People live in apartments all across California who are exposed to secondhand smoke on a daily basis," Knepprath said.
"It drifts from a common area or another apartment.
"
Hallett said that could one day force regulations requiring separate ventilation systems for smoking and nonsmoking apartments.
Well, Rosenthal further reports that 50 federal legislators have written to Secretary Clinton “…expressing concerns about the pipeline.” Their letter , dated June 23, 2010, said, among other things: “We believe that a full lifecycle assessment of the greenhouse gas emissions for tar sands would provide the Department of State with necessary information to determine whether issuing a presidential permit for the pipeline is consistent with the Administration’s clean energy and climate change priorities.
Numerous scientific studies have found tar sands oil to produce much higher lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions than convention oil.”
I have never been one to diminish the chutzpah of folks trying to protect their special interests by embellishing the truth.
I’m actually reading a particularly compelling - often horrifying - book right now called Merchants of Doubt .
There are all sorts of obfuscation, misinformation, disinformation, lies, and other forms of wrong dealing documented in the book, including much of the sordid saga of climate change denialism .
(I will certainly review the book here before long.
)
For now, let me just applaud the efforts of the good folks of the government of Alberta Province and their partners in the tar sands industry for a particularly robust effort at sanitizing one of the most despicable practices ever perpetrated by the oil companies - and that’s saying a lot.
I have written here on a number of occasions about the Alberta tar sands and how they despoil the forests of Canada, wreak havoc on the health of the indigenous people of the region, suck massive amounts of energy and produce truly prodigious amounts of greenhouse gases.
(For more, see this from the Natural Resources Defense Council.
)
Here, for my money, is the best factoid from the ad below: Alberta has achieved 17 million tons in reductions.
Only problem?
“Oil sands plants and upgraders produce roughly 40 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions every year.” That figure is from the Pembina Institute’s Oil Sands Program .
(I would be remiss, of course, in not pointing out that the bigger problem in all of this is the actual combustion of the fuel.
A new study from the National Energy Technology Laboratory shows that the carbon dioxide from using conventional fuel is “…ten times greater than the emissions caused by producing the crude oil…” EVs anyone?
)
Here are some updates on the carbon-intensive Alberta tar sands projects.
First, the FT’s “Energy Source” blog reports on recent analysis from Citigroup that says, among other things, “It is not a fuel source that sits naturally within a low carbon economy and is unlikely to be a strategic winner as climate regulation tightens, albeit gradually, in North America.”
Finally, here’s something noteworthy from Reuters today: Greens Launch NAFTA Action On Canada Oil Sand .
Environmental Defence Canada, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), and three private citizens have filed a complaint.
Here’s the press release from Environmental Defence and more on the tar sands from NRDC.
I’ve been wondering for some time why NRDC doesn’t sue the US government to enforce Section 526 of the 2007 energy law.
Oh well, they do seem to be very much on the case.
I’ve written about the environmentally catastrophic, greenhouse gas intensive, and, of course, hugely profitable Alberta tar sands a number of times.
We don’t seem to shine as bright a spotlight on this boondoggle here as they do in Europe.
There is a new report out from a coalition of investor groups based in Europe, the US and “down under” calling for “greater transparency on climate change exposure from oil and gas companies,” but there is some serious, focused work on the tar sands coming out of groups in Europe.
(For the perspective from the Canadians involved in the extraction, see this .
)
As you might imagine, I subscribe to a number of feeds on climate, energy and sustainability.
Here are a few that I highly recommend to you.
Nature Reports Climate Change , from the Nature Publishing Group, is an excellent resource on climate science and related matters.
Its companion blog, Climate Feedback , has timely and compelling coverage of the issues.
In the current issue of NRCC, I thought the review of the new book, Global Warring: How Environmental, Economic, and Political Crises Will Redraw the World Map, was a particularly interesting bit of reading.
The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change has an e-newsletter, UNFCCC News , with a range of interesting insights on mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology and other news.
This month’s edition , has a guest column by Peter Dunscombe, Chairman of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change , on how strong public policy should be driving private sector investment.
(Hear that US Senators ?
)
A third resource is the excellent SolveClimate , providing “daily climate news and analysis” and appealing to a broad range of “ climate players ” including environmentalists, investors, people of faith, and young people, among others.
Well written and scrupulously researched, the articles have some real heft.
There’s a great one today, for instance, on the Alberta tar sands : Report Warns Oil Sands Investors of Toxic Wastewater’s Financial Risk .
What’s one got to do with the other?
Fair question.
I wrote about this relationship in May here.
Statoil, the Norwegian oil company, has a big stake in the tar sands, and a number of leading Norwegian politicians and their parties want them out.
Many, if not most Norwegians, infinitely to their credit, want to be leaders in environmental protection and responsible energy production.
Now the US government has given, in a very real sense, its official seal of approval.
The US Department of State yesterday issued a permit to build a pipeline.
See this from the “San Francisco Chronicle.” But that’s not the end of it.
According to the article, “Environmental groups had urged Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to reject the permit, saying extracting and refining crude from Canada’s oil sands emits high amounts of greenhouse gases and threatens the water and air.
A coalition of environmental and Native American organizations vowed Thursday to challenge the permit in court, expressing disappointment with President Barack Obama’s administration.”
The State Department release, Permit for Alberta Clipper Pipeline Issued , says the pipeline “…will advance a number of strategic interests of the United States.” It also says, regarding the environmental concerns, that many factors were taken into account “…including greenhouse gas emissions.
The administration believes the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions are best addressed through each country’s robust domestic policies and a strong international agreement.” Huh?
So our domestic policy is to take Canadian oil that will greatly exacerbate the climate crisis.
Is that right?
For all the ins and outs of the review process, go to the special State Dept.
website for the project .
This issue has been looming for quite some time.
Reuters reported here in June that Hillary Clinton had been asked to deny the permits.
ForestEthics have a vigorous campaign on the tar sands and tried to get the Secretary’s attention.
In a letter to Clinton, they said “For the U.S., continued dependence on tar sands oil would impair plans to reduce our carbon footprint in the short and long term.” Earlier this month, the FT noted that Decision on pipeline threatens to soil Obama’s green image .
They quoted the director of climate change at WWF-Canada: “Approving new mega-projects like the Alberta Clipper pipeline would lock North America into the old, high-carbon energy economy.
We need to invest in the green economy of the future, not pour billions into the Betamax of the energy world.” The administration decision is antithetical to those other progressive, smart decisions on renewables and environmental protection that they have been taking and I have been chronicling here .
StatoilHydro, the Norwegian state oil and gas company, one of the biggest in the world, has a big stake in the tar sands.
Considerable pressure is being brought to bear on StatoilHydro and Norway to divest themselves of their interest.
The “Globe and Mail” reported today on Greenpeace’s initiative to get the company to get out.
Greenpeace “…calls the oil sands an environmental time bomb that will dramatically speed global warming.” Here is Greenpeace itself on the subject: “…campaign investors are starting to question the wisdom of paying for a project which will destroy an area of forest the size of England, then poison the ground and condemn the world to runaway climate change.” Danske Bank has expressed its opposition to StatoilHydro’s stake and Norway’s largest bank, DnBNOR, is discussing the matter, and also Folksam, a Swedish insurance company and KPA, a Swedish pension fund, are voting for withdrawal at today’s annual meeting.
Given the government’s stated support and the fact that they own two-thirds of the company, the vote will go down.
So what’s the answer for the Canadians on the dilemma of addressing the massive GHG burden of the tar sands: Green Bitumen .
What’s that mean?
“By utilizing various technologies natural gas can slowly be removed from the fuel mix and replaced with nuclear energy, and gasification.
Those facilities that still use natural gas or a synthetic gas derived from coal/coke would begin to adopt Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) as a way to reduce the emissions that belch from the facility with each barrel of bitumen.” My gut reaction?
They’re tripping.
The folks at CERI have a mission: to promote Canadian energy exports no matter how destructive to the regional environment and to the climate system they may be.
I have noted some of the many drawbacks of pursuing both the nuclear power path and the CCS path here a fair number of times.
So the proposal to exacerbate the many problems posed by tar sands extraction by seeking to power the operations by nuclear plants and/or to wishfully think that CCS will bury the CO
But what about nuclear when capital from investors is at stake?
“Nuclear power is continuing its decades-long collapse in the global marketplace because it’s grossly uncompetitive, unneeded, and obsolete.” (See more at Rocky Mountain Institute’s “ Nuclear Power: Climate Fix or Folly?
“)
Meanwhile, across the pond, the new British coalition government , may have, by its appointment of Liberal Democrat Chris Huhne as minister for Energy and Climate Change, sounded the death knell for new nuclear power.
Nuclear will not get atom of help from this Government reads the headline from “The Times.” Citigroup reported last November, for Britain, The Economics Say No - without massive amounts of public money.
With as Homeric a public debt as Greece, the UK is not about to sink billions of pounds into the black hole of new nuclear.
Here are a few more nails for the coffin.
Environmental impact : Indian Point, on the Hudson River, accounts for the deaths of about a billion fish a year.
Inadequacy of water supply : During the devastating European heat wave in the summer of 2003, France, Spain and Germany were forced to shut down numerous nuclear plants and reduce the power output of others because of low water supplies.
Reliability: Nuclear power’s much-vaunted reliability comes up against some stark numbers.
Lovins - perhaps not surprisingly - again: “A broader assessment of reliability tends not to favor nuclear power.
Of all 132 U.S. nuclear plants built-just over half of the 253 originally ordered-21% were permanently and prematurely closed due to reliability or cost problems.
Another 27% have completely failed for a year or more at least once.”
I’ve found nuclear power wanting for nearly 40 years.
I read John Gofman and Arthur Tamplin’s superb Poisoned Power when it first came out.
If there has been any argument that might mitigate the manifest evils of nuclear power in all these decades it is that the climate crisis requires us to produce low-carbon energy.
But, as we’ve seen, that is a Big Lie.
It is very clear indeed that further pursuit of the “nuclear option” will in fact take us closer, and more quickly, to climate catastrophe.
Yesterday I mentioned a number of big-ticket reasons to think that nuclear power is a very bad bet indeed: It bleeds money from smarter, cheaper and much more climate-friendly options; it’s dangerous; it’s radically inefficient; it’s not, at the end of the day - that is to say, through the whole life cycle - a particularly low-carbon approach, certainly relative to wind and solar; and we don’t have an inexhaustible supply of fissionable material.
There are many more reasons why nukes are the wrong path: waste for instance.
Here is an FT article that talks about some of the problems in the US.
After spending nearly $9 billion on Yucca Mountain , the proposed long-term high-level disposal facility, President Obama pulled the plug last year.
(Politics? Don’t ask.
) Meanwhile, there are tens of thousands of tons of radioactive waste languishing at civilian nuclear reactor sites in the US alone, not to mention “22,000 canisters of solid defense-related radioactive waste for future disposal in a repository,” according to the DOE.
Is there a safe, environmentally acceptable way to dispose of nuclear waste ?
Not yet, according to Greenpeace here .
What about reprocessing the waste into fuel?
“Reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel would increase, not decrease, the total volume of nuclear waste.” That’s what the Union of Concerned Scientists says here .
Oh, by the way, any idea how long you need to keep the high-level waste fully isolated in order to protect public health?
Well, just one constituent of this waste among many, Plutonium-239, has a half-life of 24,000 years.
That means that you have to think in terms of segregating it safely for hundreds of thousands of years.
Can you watch over and protect this waste for all this time?
See this new movie, Into Eternity , about long-term radioactive waste storage.
The director was interviewed recently on NPR .
From the interview: “But in 1995, the Academy of Science was asked whether it is possible to, on a scientific ground, to say that it is possible to communicate to the future and it is possible to deter inadvertent human intrusion.
And the question - the answer on that was, in both cases, no.
It’s not possible to, on a scientific ground, to guarantee this.”
Logically, to what might you think all that highly radioactive material in all those places all over the world would lend itself?
The threat of nuclear weapon proliferation and terrorism , perhaps?
Others would agree.
Among these are the very good people at the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.
The group was founded “…in 1945 by scientists, engineers, and other experts who had created the atomic bomb as part of the Manhattan Project.
They knew about the horrible effects of these new weapons and devoted themselves to warning the public about the consequences of using them.” Since then, their sense of responsibility has expanded to nuclear energy, biosecurity and, perhaps not surprisingly, climate change.
In my classes on climate change and on clean tech, I identify nuclear power, along with carbon capture and storage (CCS) and geoengineering, as red herrings.
By this I mean that these are wasteful technologies that only distract us from the urgent task of restructuring our consumption and production patterns to allow the planet to cool down.
This definition , from a treatise on logic and debate, says “The term red herring is sometimes used loosely to refer to any kind of diversionary tactic, such as presenting relatively unimportant arguments that will use up the other debaters’ speaking time and distract them from more important issues.” That’s precisely what the debate on nuclear power does: uses up our time, not to mention our money and energy, and distracts us from infinitely more fruitful pursuits.
First and foremost, it siphons money from our efforts on real clean tech: energy efficiency, renewables, green building, etc.
Amory Lovins, in his paper “ Four Nuclear Myths ” says it succinctly and eloquently: “…expanding nuclear power…will reduce and retard climate protection.
That’s because…new nuclear power is so costly and slow that …it will save about 2-20 times less carbon per dollar, and about 20-40 times less carbon per year, than investing instead in the market winners-efficient use of electricity and…’micropower,’ comprising distributed renewables…and cogenerating electricity together with useful heat in factories and buildings.” (I made the same argument to the Chairman of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority a couple of years ago.
)
Low Carbon?
Not Really: One analyst, writing in Energy Policy recently, notes “…that nuclear power is not directly emitting greenhouse gas emissions, but rather that lifecycle emissions occur through plant construction, operation, uranium mining and milling, and plant decommissioning.” An article from Nature Reports Climate Change summarizes the findings thus: nuclear power is much less GHG-intensive than coal or gas, but much more than solar or wind - “…nuclear emits twice as much carbon as solar photovoltaic, at 32 gCO
To tell you that I haven’t been skeptical about the value of a weak Senate climate and energy bill would be lying to you.
For one thing, I’m pretty happy with how the EPA has been approaching the regulation of greenhouse gases .
I’d hate to see strong programs like this and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) and Western Climate Initiative (WCI) get swept aside by something less effective.
The House vehicle, the American Clean Energy and Security Act - aka Waxman-Markey, is a strong piece of legislation, covering all the bases.
I’d also hate to see a nuclear power revival in this country, or even just more billions upon billions go down the toilet while we are in easy reach of a 100% renewable energy economy.
In any event, the Senate, after months of negotiation with the White House, internally among Senators, with the House leadership, and certainly with industry and environmentalists, has rolled out its package .
John Kerry has been spearheading the bill and had this to say today: “We have a never-before-seen coalition from across America, including key stakeholders embracing energy and climate legislation for the first time ever.” Some key players from core constituencies had comment .
Frances Beinecke, President, Natural Resources Defense Council : “The core carbon pollution limits in the bill, covering all major pollution sources, are a solid foundation for Senate legislation.” Jim Rogers, CEO, Duke Energy : “The legislation can help the U.S. get its economic ‘mojo’ back.
Operation Free : “America’s military leadership … have all identified climate change and oil dependence as security threats.” Roger Johnson, President, National Farmers Union : “We strongly support economic incentives from the climate change bill to enable agriculture to play a positive role.”
A short summary of the bill reveals that there are “…separate, targeted mechanisms for the three major emitting sectors: power plants, heavy industry and transportation.” I will leave deeper analysis off for the time being and defer to keen minds like Joe Romm at Climate Progress who asks here if the bill meets critically important criteria , like dropping the US substantially below its business-as-usual path on greenhouse gases.
He says yes.
Remember too, that the rest of the world is looking to the US to come back to the table with strong further proposals for an international regime.
Lest we forget, the European Union’s climate chief, Connie Hedegaard, had a lot to say on this recently.
I was a fan of Gordon Brown on climate change.
Among other virtues, he was outspoken about the Denialists and he picked up the ball on climate finance and ran with it after Copenhagen.
He is leaving No.
10 today and David Cameron will soon be the new Prime Minister.
See this from the AP.
So what’s that mean for climate change and energy policy in the UK?
Thankfully, the British Conservative Party is a lot less conservative on these issues than other conservative parties in other countries, some of which I won’t name - like the Republican Party in the US.
(Oops, I did.
Sorry.)
Meanwhile, the Tories’ junior partner in government, the Liberal Democrats, are fully committed to a “smart decentralised grid” in a “zero-carbon Britain.” Their webpage on Energy and Climate Change is also unequivocal about nukes: “More nuclear power will soak up subsidy, centralise energy production and hinder development of Britain’s vast renewable resources.
Nuclear has a dirty legacy and increases global security risks.
We oppose construction of further nuclear power stations.” Hear, hear.
I wrote about The Melting Himalayas over a year ago.
Notwithstanding the relatively absurd brouhaha in January caused by the discovery of a one-paragraph error in the 4th Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, research on glacier loss in the Himalayas has been continuing apace.
The minor peccadillo in the report was trumpeted, far and wide, by climate change Denialists, and vastly inflated by the media - as they will do.
Orville Schell, Editor-in-Chief of “ China Green ,” a multimedia enterprise of the Asia Society, has an informative piece on the glaciers in the latest “NY Review of Books.” Schell surveys some key issues, like the impact of warming and black carbon on the glaciers.
He quotes Jim Hansen to the effect that “continued ‘business-as-usual’ emission of greenhouse gases and black soot will result in the loss of most Himalayan glaciers this century, with devastating effects on fresh water supplies.” That’s water that serves a billion people in East, Southeast, and South Asia, give or take a few million - and depending on how far into the future we’re looking at and the populations then.
For more on the Himalayas, see On Thinner Ice , also from the Asia Society, and The Third Pole , from ChinaDialogue.
Meanwhile, the countries whose people have the most to lose by the continuing melting of the Third Pole that supplies so much of their water, India and China, are continuing to rely on coal, the greatest single contributor to the greenhouse gas superheating the climate system.
Here’s an item from the FT that indicates that India is at least looking at the environmental impacts of coal extraction on its forests.
Over in China, the coal train keep coming.
In fact, it’s a runaway train.
According to this from the Post Carbon Institute, “China’s coal output grew an astonishing 28.1 percent from first quarter 2009 to first quarter 2010, to over 750 million metric tons consumed in just the past three months.” The article, though, reports that China is running out of coal and surveys some of its options, including renewables and nuclear power.
See also this characteristically informative article from Keith Bradsher at the “NYT.” He writes: “The increase in oil and coal-fired electricity consumption in the first quarter was twice as fast as economic growth of about 12 percent for that period, a sign that rising energy consumption is not just the result of a rebounding economy but also of changes in the mix of industrial activity.
The shift in activity is partly because of China’s economic stimulus program, which has resulted in a surge in public works construction that requires a lot of steel and cement.”
The FT covered their climate change meeting in Beijing this past weekend and reported here that the two Asian superpowers “…said it would be very difficult to achieve a strong international agreement on climate change at the summit in Mexico later this year…” My question is, given past performance , how hard will they try?
Well, aside from hybrids and EVs, there’s the fuel cell car.
It’s about time, it seems to me.
Honda is coming out with the FCX Clarity .
Seems like a blockbuster to me.
Emissions? No carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrocarbons, oxides of nitrogen, or particulates.
Only water vapor.
ZEV works for me.
You?
The Petersberg Climate Dialogue took place near Bonn this week.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Mexican President Felipe Calderón brought together environment and climate ministers from 45 countries to “discuss what concrete steps should be taken” prior to the next UNFCCC “Conference of the Parties” (COP) in Cancún in December.
Outgoing UNFCCC Executive Secretary Yvo de Boer spoke at the conference.
His speech outlined where he thinks the process of international climate negotiations is now.
“Trust” was his theme as well.
“Trust in the process needs to be rebuilt as a matter of urgency,” said de Boer.
He identified several key policy issues for resolution:
As reported here by Bloomberg, the conference was thought to have brought “movement to the climate talks.” Mexico, the host for the COP this year, is taking it all very, very seriously.
Their officials intend to do a lot of traveling this year “… to pave the way for specific agreements on adaptation, funding and technology…”
Ozone never ceases to surprise.
Scientists report in this issue of Nature that halogen compounds such as bromide and iodine oxide play an unexpectedly large role in chemically breaking down the gas in the troposphere.
Ozone is best known for its presence – or in fact for its seasonal absence - in the upper atmosphere.
The stratospheric ozone layer, which protects the earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation, is still being chemically attacked by reactions involving long-lived chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) banned 20 years ago.
But Nature reported last year about a puzzling inconsistency discovered in the established chemical model of stratospheric ozone destruction.
The troposphere is a very different story, though.
Near the ground, ozone can affect human health; in high concentrations it is even toxic.
Above the ground layer it acts as a greenhouse gas which, when it chemically breaks up, initiates the removal of methane (an even stronger greenhouse gas) and other hydrocarbons from the atmosphere.
So ozone loss in the troposphere is a good thing, really.
The gas is typically destroyed in marine regions by chemical reactions involving water vapour.
Tropical oceans regions, where levels of solar radiation are high, are thought to be the most important ozone sink.
So what about halogens?
Anthropogenically produced CFCs are stable in the troposphere, and are therefore not a reactive halogen source there.
But models studies have suggested that bromine and iodine chemistry does contribute to breaking down ozone in the troposphere, potentially changing the global ozone budget by up to 20 %.
The measurements which Katie Read of the University of York and her team have made in the tropical Atlantic Ocean now provide strong confirmation of substantial ‘halogen-mediated’ ozone destruction.
An editor's summary and the paper are here .
The team analysed the first eight months of measurements from the new Cape Verde Atmospheric Observatory on the remote island of São Vicente in the tropical Atlantic.
They found that average daily ozone loss was around 50 % more than predicted by a state-of-the-art chemistry model that excludes halogen chemistry.
Aircraft-borne observations in the area confirmed these findings.
But the team also measured ubiquitous daytime concentrations of iodine and bromine oxides in the layer of the troposphere where most ozone loss occurs.
These reactive molecules are emitted by marine algae and liberated from salty sea spray.
In a simple model calculation, the observed halogen concentrations induced just about the extra 50 % ozone loss in the region.
The omission of halogen sources in atmospheric models “may lead to significant errors in calculations of global ozone budgets,” the authors write.
But even so, the results are significant.
Ozone is a powerful oxidizing agent and a key constituent of the troposphere; changes in its concentration will feedback on the lifetime of methane and other hydrocarbons in the air.
It is good to know that tropical ocean regions are a larger-than-thought ozone sink.
But the composition of the atmosphere is in such fine balance that its cleansing ability cannot be taken for granted as being permanent.
In the face of the new measurements it seems essential to include halogen sources and chemistry in global climate models.
Twenty years ago yesterday, Dr. James Hansen gave a landmark testimony to US Congress in which he told senators that global warming was real, it was happening, and humanity was to blame.
“People are broadly concerned, but not entirely convinced”, concludes the l atest poll on public opinion of global warming by social marketing group Ipsos Mori.
Despite the deluge of media reports in the last year documenting the scientific consensus on climate change and the startling rapidity at which impacts are being seen around the world - most notably perhaps the ever-decreasing Arctic sea ice - 60% of the British Public is uncertain that climate change is caused by humans, and many others believe that scientists are overstating the problem.
There is growing concern that an economic depression and rising fuel and food prices are denting public interest in environmental issues.
Some environmentalists blame the public's doubts on last year's Channel 4 documentary The Great Global Warming Swindle, and on recent books, including one by Lord Lawson, the former Chancellor, that question the consensus on climate change.
The Great Global Warming Swindle resulted in a record 250 complaints to regulatory watchdog Ofcom (including the first ever peer reviewed complaint), but that’s still a fraction of the 2.5 million viewers.
Like many of those who saw the Channel 4 documentary, readers of Lawson’s offering on climate change ‘An Appeal to Reason’ are probably unaware it has been scientifically discredited in almost every review, including one on Nature Reports Climate Change by Sir John Houghton , Honorary Scientist at the UK’s Hadley Centre.
Promised as a "rare breath of intellectual rigour" and a "hard headed examination of the realities" of climate change, this offering is neither cool nor rational….and is largely one of misleading messages.
Lawson’s fundamental misunderstanding of basic scientific concepts is first displayed in his interpretation of the temperature records for the first part of this century, with which he attempts to discredit the science of climate change, and the work of many thousands of researchers who’ve dedicated entire careers to the problem.
More recently, he repeats this in an amusing attack on the recent Nature paper by NASA’s Cynthia Rosenzweig.
As Houghton rightly points out, Lawson is in need of climate science 101.
But then, it seems, he's not alone - at least on that count.
Don't grieve the Boxer-Lieberman-Warner climate bill , urges Joseph Romm in a Nature Reports Climate Change Commentary this week.
Romm, voice of the Climate Progress blog, writes:
Although hailed as landmark legislation, the proposal, which died after it failed to muster close to the required 60 votes [in the US Senate], would not have put the nation on the path required to help avert catastrophic climate change.
The bill, like most climate plans now up for serious debate around the world, relied heavily on imposing a financial penalty for carbon emissions.
But Europe's up-and-running emissions market has done little to curb the continent's appetite for carbon, and that should make legislators and negotiators queasy, argues Romm.
"The United States simply cannot wait another decade to find out whether domestic cap-and-trade legislation will drive carbon dioxide to a high enough price to curb emissions growth sharply," he says.
Nor is new technology the answer:
Romm said more about this Thursday in a cross-posted entry at Climate Progress and Grist , in the process resurrecting a set-to with Roger Pielke, Jr, on their respective blogs in April and May.
Development economist Jeffrey Sachs , famous for the economic turnarounds he's helped engineer as an advisor to Latin American and Eastern European governments, is also known for his optimism that the living standards of the world's poorest can be raised much higher without sacrificing either the wealth of the industrialized world or crucial natural resources.
But among analysts of global change, optimism is relative.
"I believe that there is most likely a path of sustainable development, but we can't quite be sure," Sachs told a sold-out lecture hall at the London Zoo last night.
"It's a question mark.
"
Sachs spoke on big themes from his new book Common Wealth: Economics for a Crowded Planet , notably the need for expansion beyond market-based thinking to face problems not dreamt of in Adam Smith's philosophy.
Before and after this rousing overview (if you'd bet ahead of time that Sachs would quote John F. Kennedy at length, you'd have won), I had the chance to get some nittier, grittier details on how Sachs wants to deal with climate change.
More and better government investment in foreign aid and green tech is the number-one key for Sachs - only the US presidential turnover seemed to run a close second, and cap-and-trading was off in the distance .
So he didn't hesitate to offer a laundry list of projects that he thinks need much more political commitment - among them carbon capture and storage , passively heated and cooled green buildings , and super duper climate computers .
Technological solutions often raise ownership problems, though.
If, for example, the agrobiotech industry produces new 'climate-proof' crop varieties that survive floods and droughts - an innovation Sachs welcomed at a recent climate modelling summit - can the developing world afford to buy the seeds?
In the case of African food shortages, he added, simple, readily available remedies like chemical fertilizers and high-yield non-GMO crops had been "sitting on the shelf" until the global food price crisis grabbed headlines.
We shouldn't have to wait for disasters before we take the equivalent action on climate change, he said.
Honoring commitments to monetary aid and technology transfer is the first step, he told me.
To get a global climate agreement out of the UN process, he also thinks we need to start by welcoming the economic growth of rapidly developing nations like China and India.
"That's the icebreaker on this first date," he said.
From that viewpoint, country-specific emissions targets can be set that correspond to growth along the greenest possible paths.
By 2050, he explained, that might mean that the North cuts its greenhouse emissions by 80% while India's emissions are allowed to double - a contraction-and-convergence plan.
Because China and India have even more to fear from climate change than does the wealthier world, he said, it's an ultimatum they'll have to accept: "You're going to develop.
But you're going to do it with the best technology.
"
What happens to the planet if air traffic keeps multiplying too fast for new climate-friendly plane upgrades to keep pace with the rising greenhouse emissions?
The IPCC mulled it over almost a decade ago, even before sounding its 2001 global warming alarm call .
Lately the problem has been pressing ever harder on European consciences, so that EU parliament members recently vowed to fast-track plans for trading aviation emissions on a carbon market - while airlines yelped defensively that they'd gotten an unfair tarring in mediagenic protests .
London's Science Museum examines this race of energy efficiency against passenger numbers in a new exhibit, Does Flying Cost the Earth?, which I took a look at in Nature Reports Climate Change this week.
Much of the show is reproduced online , including the museum's smart matrix of pros and cons for various technologies proposed to clean up jet fumes.
(There are more details in a recent roundup of aviation innovation from Nature News ; subscription required.
) For a quick gut-level hit of the central dilemma, the museum has included a very simple video game where you're in charge of containing the damage from a booming aviation industry.
For all tree huggers out there, this week’s Science is dedicated to ‘forests in flux’, paying tribute to the trees and their contribution to the greater good.
A special collection of articles in print, with complementary and online material, examines the fate of the world’s forests, in the face of climate change and an escalating human population.
Of particular relevance to discussions on how forests can mitigate global warming, Lera Miles and Valerie Kapos have a Perspective highlighting the risks involved in proposed schemes such as REDD (reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) and how to minimize them.
Also on this topic, Josep Canadell and Michael Raupach write on what science currently tells us is the best way to manage forests for sequestering carbon.
Drew Purves and Stephen Pacala discuss how forest dynamics remain one of the largest uncertainties in predicting future climate change and detail some of the efforts underway to improve their representation in models.
Or for a really solid review of how forests affect climate change, check out Gordan Bonan’s piece here .
Forests hold more than double the amount of carbon in the atmosphere.
GPP is Gross Primary Production, a measure of the daily output of the global biosphere --the amount of new plant matter on land.
NPP is Net Primary Production, an annual tally of the globe's production.
Biomass is booming.
The planet is the greenest it's been in decades, perhaps in centuries.
Judging by his record Mr Solomon likes to find new, surprising stories that over turn the evil IPCC-led consensus on climate science.
Not clear, though, that he's very successful: this is neither new nor surprising.
The work cited seems to be a 2004 paper by Steve Running and colleagues on monitoring NPP using the MODIS satellite data set ( BioScience 54, 547-560 (2004) -- pdf ), so it's hardly news.
What's more, everyone studying carbon dioxide levels agrees that there are "biological sinks" -- places where more carbon-dioxide means more biomass, either because of the direct carbon-dioxide-fertilisation effect (it is, after all, plant food) or because the climatic effects are to the benefit of plants.
Growth in sinks = growth in biomass.
And a billion tonnes of carbon or so flowing into sinks every year will add up, over time.
No denying that.
Whether and how to put a price on carbon has been something of a hot topic this week, primarily due to the proposal of a landmark climate change bill to the US Senate that would "cap and trade" emissions of the greenhouse gas.
Perhaps somewhat unsurprisingly, the climate change bill offered by Senators Boxer, Lieberman, and Warner died today in the Senate after Democrat leaders fell a dozen votes short of the 60 needed to defeat Republican obstruction .
Republicans opposed the global warming bill over fears of the economic costs of pricing the greenhouse gas, though Democrats argued there would be no cost to consumers, who would be aided with tax relief.
The debate over "cap and trade" legislation is now expected to be postponed until next year, when there is a new president in the White House.
The issue is taken up this week on Nature Reports Climate Change by Roger Pielke Jr who reviews Earth: The Sequel by Fred Krupp and Miriam Horn of the Environmental Defense Fund.
The basic tenet of the book is that a US carbon market with tradable credits would provide the profit incentive needed to energize potential innovators of low or no-carbon technology – thus meeting the world's escalating demand for green energy.
But Pielke Jr argues:
By placing their attention on the need for innovative energy technologies, Krupp and Horn have focused on the one area where advocates for action on greenhouse gas reduction are in strong agreement.
They have avoided engaging in the real debate over the policies necessary to decarbonize the growing global economy and, crucially, over whether and how to put a price on carbon dioxide.
Meanwhile, over on Dot Earth , Andy Revkin has written about an alternative, though less popular, pricing approach known as “cap and dividend”.
The scheme, being strongly endorsed by NASA climatologist James Hansen, is based on the principle of making the polluter pay without placing the burdening of rising costs on the consumer, the most commonly cited down-side of "cap and trade" (discussed by Pielke Jr in the above review).
Revkin explores two proposals for “cap and dividend”: one by Hansen that involves taxing fuels by their carbon content, and another by investment pioneer Peter Barnes that entails selling a steadily declining number of permits for emitting carbon dioxide.
The latter would force polluters to eventually pay the full whack of their carbon consumption, and the revenue would be returned to citizens.

From tomorrow, Nature reporter and Climate Feedback blogger Quirin Schiermeier will be spending a week aboard the Canadian research icebreaker CCGS Amundsen , as part of a project to study climate change in the high Canadian Arctic.
During the field season, from October 2007 to August 2008, more than 200 scientists from 15 countries will be studying the impact of climate change on sea ice, Arctic peoples, and marine ecosystems in some of the biologically most productive areas of the Arctic.
Ethanol fuel made from corn - big business in the US - has taken particularly heavy blame for food prices, as it uses up grain that could feed people and livestock, and fields that could be planted with other edible crops.
Last year's US energy bill included a full-steam-ahead target to quintuple ethanol production in 15 years - a commitment that John McCain and 23 other Senate Republicans last month urged the EPA to ignore because of the food crisis.
Across the pond, the EU is still trying to figure out how to insert sustainability caveats into its controversial plan to make 10% of all transport fuel renewable (i.e.
plant-based) by 2020.
For more on what's driving food prices - including the possibility that we've lost some arable land to global warming and are set to lose more - Grist's breakdown and this International Food Policy Research Institute report are good places to start.

I’m due to travel to Japan this Friday for a conference on Climate Change Effects on Fish and Fisheries.
If I get there, I’ll be providing regular updates from the conference here on Climate Feedback.
But that’s beginning to look like a big ‘if’.
The volcanic ash cloud from Eyjafjallajökull is still keeping planes grounded across the UK and could do for several days to come .
That’s bad news for a lot of people, but could it be good news for the climate?
There’s also the question of how the absence of contrails – or condensation clouds – from commercial airplanes will affect the climate in the short term.
Remember that post 9/11 contrail study , which supposedly showed that the average daily temperature over the continental US suddenly widened in the 3 days after the September 11 terrorist attacks, when all commercial air traffic was banned from American skies?
Its main conclusion – that daily highs and lows in temperature were more extreme in the absence of contrails - has since been refuted , but the flight ban over Europe should provide another opportunity to test the hypothesis.
And then, of course, there’s the ash from Eyjafjallajökull itself.
The eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991 cooled global temperatures by about half a degree over the following months, which has led some to propose pumping sulphate aerosols into the atmosphere as a means of artificially cooling the climate.
Katharine Sanderson writes on The Great Beyond :
So will the ash from have a lasting effect on our climate?
Probably not according to Alan Robock, a meteorologist from Rutgers University, New Brunswick, US.
“So far, the emissions have been so small, that I expect no climate impacts,” he says.
On April 14, there was 0.004 megatons of sulphur dioxide, as compared to 20 megatons for Mount Pinatubo in 1991, and it was emitted into the troposphere, where its lifetime is only a week or so, as opposed to 1-2 years for the stratosphere for Pinatubo.
The ash will also fall out quickly, so I expect no climate impact, unless the eruption gets much stronger.
As nations struggle to agree to international regulation of climate change, some nations – and even states – are thinking of taking the matter into their own hands, by introducing a carbon tariff on imported goods.
Conceptually, the carbon tariff is a tax placed on goods that are imported usually from other nations without regulations in place to limit their greenhouse gas emissions.
Proponents of tariffs say they could protect domestic industry from competitive disadvantage and that they could also serve as a stick to motivate other countries to legislate climate policy.
But others say they are merely eco-protectionism and warn that they could trigger trade wars.
French President Nicholas Sarkozy and US energy Secretary Steven Chu have both argued in favour of carbon tariffs .
Now, Minnesota has legislated to place a tariff of $4-$34 per ton of carbon dioxide emissions to the cost of coal-fired electricity supplied by its neighbouring state, North Dakota.
The tariff will begin in 2012 and is aimed at encouraging the switch to renewable sources of energy.
North Dakota is threatening legal action against the measure, suggesting that implementing carbon tariffs will be fraught will difficulties, as predicted.
But what’s arguably more important – and most often overlooked – is the question of how effective carbon tariffs will be in achieving the ultimate goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
A team of researchers from Carnegie Mellon University address this topic in the latest issue of Nature Reports Climate Change [free access].
Catherine Izard, Christopher Weber and H. Scott Matthews argue that because of the impossibility of designing and implementing an effective tariff, the entire approach is flawed and that carbon tariffs should ultimately be scrapped.
One outcome of the failure of the Copenhagen summit is that geoengineering will likely gain more ground as a legitimate solution to climate change.
Naturally enough, as efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions are postponed quick fixes to cool the climate – such as spraying sulphate aerosols into the atmosphere or artificially brightening clouds – become more attractive.
While controlling the climate was once the stuff of science fiction, in the past year scientists have started to turn focus more on geoengineering, realizing that it might be a much-needed last ditch attempt to curb the most serious impacts of rising temperatures.
Even commercial companies are starting to develop technologies for climate control.
One such company, Intellectual Ventures in Bellevue, Washington, has filed for several patents for climate-altering technologies, among them a proposal known as StratoShield that would involve using a long hose suspended from balloons to waft sulphates into the atmosphere.
But while tests and trials are already underway, there are currently no laws in place to regulate geoengineering.
Given the known, and possibly unknown, dangerous side effects of tinkering with the climate, there is an urgent need for global governance.
Mason Inman explores this issue in detail in a feature ‘Planning for plan B’ in the latest issue of Nature Reports Climate Change [free access].
Some argue that perhaps there should be a global ban on geoengineering, but thers are keen to see research proceed.
After all, says Granger Morgan, director of Carnegie Mellon’s Climate Decision Making Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the world at some point may face tough decisions on whether to condone geoengineering, such as if a major state found that it couldn’t feed it’s people because of climate change.
“If we haven’t done the research, the international community has to fall back on a moral argument, as opposed to a science-based argument,” says Morgan.
The Institute of Marine Engineering, Science and Technology – an international body that traditionally has represented marine industry and more recently, scientists too – today released its position statement on climate change .
A gargantuan plan of supplying European consumers with electricity generated in the Saharan desert could see the light of day earlier than even the most optimistic solar energy aficionados had expected.
Commercial ships steaming through international waters are pumping out increasing amounts of greenhouse gases that are out of the reach of the Kyoto Protocol and national regulatory schemes.
A new report from the UK parliament’s Environmental Audit Committee warns it could take years to bring these emissions under control.
The UN’s International Maritime Organisation - tasked under Kyoto with figuring out how to regulate emissions from shipping - has failed to move fast enough, says the report.
An IMO meeting on the issue held in October 2008 did not get as far as formulating a proposal that could be part of the negotiating text for a new global climate deal, now under discussion in Bonn.
There can be no excuse for the lack of progress within the International Maritime Organisation since the Kyoto protocol was signed.
That the IMO has yet to reach agreement even over the type of emissions control regime to take forward, let alone decide any details, suggests it is not fit for purpose in this vital area.
In April I reported that economic and political pressures were beginning to impact the UN carbon-credit programme that supports clean technology projects in the developing world, otherwise known as the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM).
The full story is also in the latest issue of Nature Reports Climate Change.
Stimulating algal growth by adding iron to nutrient-poor ocean regions is one of several geo-engineering methods that could possibly mitigate greenhouse warming.
But given widespread worries about possibly harmful side-effects on marine life, large-scale ocean ‘fertilization’ is currently not considered advisable.
The team on board the German ‘ Polarstern ’, who plan to spread 20 tonnes of iron sulphate over less than 20 by 20 kilometres-large patch of ocean surface in the Scotia Sea, hope that the study will provide new insight into how ocean ecosystems respond to fertilization – the very data, hence, that are needed to assess whether or not larger-scale future activities might be justified.
But opponents counter that such doing already qualifies as an activity banned by UN law.
Pressure groups have launched a signature campaign aimed at stopping the Polarstern crew, which will reach its destination by the end of the week, from dumping its load.
Over on the New York Times’ Green Inc. blog , James Kanter reports that hopes have soared in Europe toward global cooperation on climate change following Obama’s appointment as President-elect.
Earlier today, Hans-Gert Pöttering, the president of the European Parliament, welcomed a new start for transatlantic relations on issues including climate change and invited Mr. Obama to address the European Parliament next spring.
That would be the first time a U.S. president has spoken at the European Parliament since Ronald Reagan’s address in Strasbourg in 1985, writes Kanter.
Is the global financial crisis good or bad for green issues?
The ongoing controversy over the European Union’s ambitious climate and energy package suggests the latter might be the case.
But political and economical analysts seem to be increasingly confident that the current crisis might give rise to environmentally healthier policies and investment decisions.
An editorial in this week’s Nature lays out the options and prospects for EU climate policies in light of the financial crisis:
“Striking the required bargains may require more time than the remaining two months under French presidency.
But a well-weighed set of rules is far and away preferable to a rushed political compromise that would substantially water down the EU’s ambitious climate plan.
(…) Meanwhile, the current economic turbulence cannot be allowed to serve as a pretext for lessening climate protection efforts.”
Any agreement will come too late for the international climate talks next month in Poznan, Poland (of all places).
But a strong European commitment to cutting greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20 % would be a much-needed signal to the UN climate meeting in Copenhagen 2009, where nations hope to conclude on a successor treaty to the Kyoto Protocol .
The European Parliament’s environment committee yesterday voted largely in favour of the ambitious European climate action plan (subscription) proposed in January.
The decision, although preliminary, allows the European Union (EU) to go into the upcoming next round of international climate negotiations with a common goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions across Europe by at least 20 % by 2020.
The European commission, Council and Parliament must yet formally agree on details of the plan, but substantial changes are now considered unlikely.
Introduced in 2005, the ETS is as yet the only mandatory emissions trading system in the world.
Until now, power stations and other large European industries have benefitted from generous supply of free permits to release carbon dioxide.
Much of the commission’s proposed reform was aimed to end the over-allocation of emission allowances.
The environment committee did make some concessions to industry, though.
The threshold for facilities – currently around 10,000 - which participate in the ETS is to be raised from 10,000 to 25,000 tonnes of annual carbon dioxide emissions.
The report (which I've not yet scanned: here's a note from Roger at Prometheus ) says that to make this happen will take about €10bn in subsidies.
Hey, I thought -- that's about 2% of the proposed banking bail-out (and over a fair bit of time, too).
If we can afford to bail out the banks -- probably a good idea, if it's done properly -- surely we can afford to make a few investments like this to get us the tools for dealing with the carbon/climate crisis.
With much of the corporate world competing to be ahead of the decarbonization curve, it's not uncommon to see investors actually begging governments for more regulations, as a prominent group in the US did this week .
More remarkable is witnessing oil goliath Exxon Mobil torn by a climate-driven shareholder revolt and its backlash.
On fossil fuels and climate change, Exxon in the past has not so much failed to read the writing on the wall as actively attempted to efface it .
That's changed , but not enough, say the heirs of John D. 'Standard Oil' Rockefeller, whose ancestral ex-monopoly forms Exxon's core.
The Rockefellers are sponsoring four shareholder resolutions that will come to a vote at the company's annual shareholder meeting May 28.
According to The Independent , they say Exxon needs to research how climate change will affect the developing world, fund alternative fuels, reduce its carbon footprint, and spur more managerial debate by splitting up the roles of chariman and CEO - both posts are currently held by Rex Tillerson.
At last year's meeting, says The Guardian , a call to split up Tillerson's jobs got 40% yays, and addressing climate change got 30%.
With a vast green tide and 19 institutional investors backing up the Rockefellers (who own only 0.006% of Exxon's stock, the company says ), this year could see even greater support.
would impose "rigid, ideologically-based conditions on the company's future," would nullify "the judgment of a highly successful management team," and would "undercut every project and business operation.
" This would "hamstring ExxonMobil's profitability and growth, thus directly harming the police officers, firefighters, teachers and public employees whose retirement savings are invested in the company.

Reuters reported Friday that the long-awaited Montreal Climate Exchange will open on May 30, buying and selling voluntary emissions reductions in the same fashion as the Chicago Climate Exchange , its US partner.
But absolute emissions isn't what they'll limit - they're talking about regulating emissions intensity, or the amount of emissions per unit of production, from 2010.
That could make it tough to integrate into a global climate deal, since the EU caps absolute emissions and all three US presidential candidates want to do the same.
Interestingly, the plan also mandates carbon capture and storage for oil sands, a carbon-intensive economic lynchpin of the country.
Besides the voluntary market, local measures could already be in play when and if these limits come down.
British Columbia is leading the way with what is to be the first carbon tax implemented outside of Europe.
Although the tax hasn't been looking very popular and faces the same too-much-is-never-enough criticism that the EU climate bill came in for , liberal leader Stephane Dion now says he'd like the national strategy to be a carbon tax - or something.
Anything. "We can talk about what the best model for putting a price on carbon across Canada might be –– but the fact is we need to JUST DO IT.
That is what this provincial government has done, and that is what a Liberal government will do," Dion said in a speech in Vancouver.
In the race to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, the Royal Society now plans to back promising new technology with venture capital as well as intellectual clout.
The Society announced Thursday it will sink its first-ever investment fund into businesses developing carbon capture and renewable energy, along with water purification and other world-saving innovations ( Financial Times ).

Global plans to tackle climate change, from the Kyoto Protocol to the recently-passed Waxman-Markey bill, have a fatal flaw: They essentially encourage large-scale deforestation, which pretty much undermines the whole idea of curbing greenhouse-gas emissions in the first place.
y of the prevailing climate-change programs.
Kyoto, the European cap-and-trade plan, and the House climate bill all treat bioenergy as carbon-neutral; nobody counts the effect of disappearing forests.
The negative reviews of the SuperFreakonomics climate chapter keep coming in.
From Boing Boing :
The opening paragraph of Carbone, Helm and Rutherford ( JEEM 58:266-280, 2009 ) who argue with theory and simulations that it might be possible to address the global public good of mitigating climate change with incentive-based policy:
The Kyoto Protocol has achieved little in terms of global emission reductions.
Current negotiations of a Post-Kyoto agreement suggest that for most countries national self-interest constitutes a dominant guiding principle.
This perception is confirmed by a poll among climate policy experts, who anticipate only modest reductions in global emissions for the year 2020.
In a nutshell, there is little hope at the moment that countries will adopt cooperative strategies and make substantial voluntary contributions to the global public good of climate protection.
In this paper we argue that even in a world where countries only pursue their national self-interest, an international system of tradable emission permits can achieve substantial emission reductions.
I haven't read any more of this paper than I have of the climate change chapter in SuperFreakonomics that might diss incentives (but for different reasons ).
Has anyone seen the TV appearances this week?
Is the climate controversy mentioned?
It seems inevitable that discussions of climate science would degenerate to being deeply politicized and polarized.
Depending on which views are adopted, individuals, industries, and countries will gain or lose, which provides ample ...

Critics (e.g.
this NY Times article via Standupeconomist blog ) of the Superfreakonomics chapter on global cooling ( here ) say that the science is settled and that skeptics are preaching nonsense.
Two reasons for skepticism are the claims, in the next breath, that the widespread mid-70s belief in global cooling was the result of "a couple of media stories" and that Katrina was caused by global warming.
Dubner's reply to his critics is here: Global Warming in SuperFreakonomics: The Anatomy of a Smear .
In the interest of promoting critical thinking, Plimer's Heaven and Earth goes much deeper than Levitt and Dubner.
You can also Google "Nature, not Human Activity, Rules the Climate" for a shorter critique of IPCC 2007.
All three critiques raise questions about the methodology of estimating climate models.
My favorite is the quote in Nature attributed to John von Neumann: “Give me four adjustable parameters and I can simulate an elephant.
Give me one more and I can make his trunk wiggle.” A climate model should also be capable of passing "the fingerprint test.
" The same model that explains variation in surface temperature data should be able to explain temperature patterns in the troposphere and the different patterns in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.
It is also instructive to read the critique of the now defunct hockey-stick analysis (from IPCC 2001) and the failure to use correct time-series methods in estimation of confidence bounds around mean surface-temperature records from tree rings and ice cores (Aufhammer, Yoo, and Wright, "Specification and Estimation of the Transfer Function in Paleoclimatic Reconstructions").
Should Levitt try to become a Krugman, Cowen, Mankiw or Harford?
Tough question.
Here is my favorite line as it reveals a fundamental problem with the climate chapter (that I still haven't read yet since I suffer the indignity of having to actually pay for the book and I can't bring myself to read a scanned PDF copy):
For Levitt to go [the Mankiw "unabashed partisan"] route, I think he'd want to set up a base in one of his research areas and go from there.
For example, he could become an advocate for community policing, or charter schools, or whatever.
(I don't think it's enough to pick a lightweight issue such as legalization of drugs; it's gotta be something that closer to the center of political debate.
And, no, becoming a climate-change activist won't work; to become a Mankiw, Levitt has to write about something that he (Levitt) is an expert on.

The ice-pack runoff from Oregon's Cascade Mountains powers the state's hydroelectric plants and irrigates its pear orchards.
Those ice packs have shrunk by 30 percent or more in the past 50 years, and state officials believe auto exhaust deserves much of the blame.
Regulators in Connecticut think carbon dioxide in auto exhaust threatens maple syrup production and the skiing industry, and they fear what rising sea levels would do to real estate values along the state's coastline if the planet's temperatures continue to rise.
On Friday, Massachusetts joined Oregon, Connecticut and five other states in adopting California's tough greenhouse gas rules, which limit the amount of carbon dioxide and other gases that can be emitted from vehicle tailpipes.
These new rules would supplement federal exhaust pollutant standards already in place.
Two other states are in the process of adopting the rules.
The carbon dioxide regulations are so strict, the auto industry argues, that they would cause extensive design changes to new vehicles, driving up prices and crippling new-car sales.
Every major automaker that sells vehicles in the United States is suing to have the new rules overturned, even as states on the West Coast and in the Northeast are moving quickly to adopt them.
Automakers are countering with a proposed 10 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emitted in vehicle production by 2012.
They have not supported restrictions on carbon dioxide emissions from vehicle tailpipes.
State regulators say they are taking the initiative because the federal government, including the Environmental Protection Agency, has been slow to act.
They worry that their efforts may ultimately be blocked at the federal level.
Also, several state regulators said they are fearful that Congress may use a forthcoming study by the National Research Council to limit states' ability to join the California program.
The study is due later this month.
In a statement, the EPA said it favors other methods of lowering carbon dioxide besides regulating tailpipe emissions, siding with automakers that the changes will limit consumer choice and raise vehicle prices.
"The only way to cut [carbon dioxide] emissions is through a drastic increase in fuel economy -- which in the past has led to smaller, lighter and less-safe vehicles," the EPA said in the statement.
The EPA's position is crucial because it would have to issue a waiver before any of California's greenhouse gas regulations could go into effect.
If California is permitted to impose the new regulations, the federal Clean Air Act allows other states with poor air quality to adopt California's rules after agency approval.
Scientists say a great deal of carbon dioxide can be absorbed in the atmosphere, but many worry that people are adding more than nature can handle.
They say the gases are building up like a heavy blanket surrounding the Earth, trapping heat and raising the planet's temperature.
(Washington, D.C.-October 27, 2005) Administrator Stephen L. Johnson today announced the results of the most detailed, comprehensive analysis of air ever conducted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
The legislative and regulatory analyses compared several cap-and-trade approaches aimed at reducing sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants.
When?
10/27 at 1 pm.
The analysis should contain some interesting material.
The Clear Skies initiative contains a big new tradeable pollution permit program that is touted by some guys that know a bit about it ( When economists dream, they dream of clear skies ).
(Washington, D.C.-October 26, 2005) In its 10 years the Acid Rain Program has significantly reduced acid deposition in the United States by cutting sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from power plants, according to the program's annual report.
The newly released Acid Rain Program 2004 Progress Report describes the environmental advances and public health, technology, and market-based improvements accomplished by the program.
Widely acknowledged as one of the most successful environmental programs in U.S. history, the program serves as a model for a new generation of air pollution control programs, such as the Clean Air Interstate Rule, which will further reduce air pollution over the next decade.
A new analysis in the Journal of Environmental Management estimates the value of the program's human health and environmental benefits in the year 2010 to be $122 billion annually.
Most of these benefits result from the prevention of health-related impacts, such as premature deaths and illnesses and workdays missed due to illness, but they also include improved visibility in parks and other recreational and ecosystem improvements.
Tim has pointed out the relationship between gas prices and bike demand .
Riding bikes improves air quality if you would have been driving otherwise.
The problem, in many places, is where do the bikers get to ride?
Luckily the federal government is happy to subsidize bike riding and improved air quality.
The [British] government says it wants a 60 percent cut in carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, compared to 1990 levels, as the nation's contribution toward preventing an increase in temperatures that would threaten a dangerous level of climate change.

Agriculture is increasingly recognized as central to the issue of stopping and reversing anthropogenic global warming.
Report after report confirms that food production and bio-fuel production , deforestation, land-use change and the conversion of savannah to pasture land contribute significantly to the world’s CO2 emissions.
But with all due respect to the Bjorn Lomborgs of the world, the “ world’s ” CO2 emissions aren’t the major impasse at global climate summits.
Individual countries’ emissions are, meaning, which country gets to emit how much carbon.
In agriculture, “indirect land-use changes” (ILUC) come into play.
Counting ILUC means, for example, that when land that used to be forest in Indonesia is planted with a crop that results in carbon fluxes into the atmosphere, and when that crop is harvested and exported to a Western country, those emissions should be part of that country’s emissions tally.
Most estimates of food production’s contribution to the UK’s total climate emissions have put it at around 20 percent.
Some claim it would be possible to reduce that 20 percent number by up to 70 percent with the right combination of remedial measures: shortening supply chains, using less energy-intensive production practices, using less herbicides and less pesticides, and cutting down on the country’s beef production, a notorious source of CO2 emissions, since beef consume so much petroleum-production-based corn and various other grains with enormous carbon footprints.
So that means there’s all the more reason to assess what the effect of UK consumption patterns are on other countries’ ecologies — if they convert virgin forest to sugarcane plantations, if massive corn or rice fields, grown as monocultures on input-intensive plantations, leach carbon from soils that had previously had negative carbon fluxes, pulling CO2 from the atmosphere, and are now major carbon emitters.
A recent World Wildlife Foundation and Network for Food and Climate Research study argues that when one includes such tallies in the total, one moves from a 20 percent figure for the food chain’s contribution to the UK’s total CO2 emissions to something more like 30 percent.
As the study’s authors note,
The report suggests that targeted top-down “central government policy” can have an effect on deforestation rates and indirect-land-use-changes, citing Brazilian governmental policies as a major example.
But such measures have only slowed deforestation, not stopped it , and until interference in markets forces policy changes — or command measures simply bar deforestation with the force of the state behind them — it’s hard to expect positive change.
It's become commonplace for Americans to blame China for air pollution and for being the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, but if we were manufacturing all the products we buy from China, the U.S. would be the largest emitter of greenhouse gases.
There are so many different equations to consider related to this whole climate change mess.
Agriculture has always been a big culprite, but has there been any major change in that?
*Sigh* I think at this point in time, all we can do is hope for the best, and that our precious planet survives what we are putting her through.
Biochar is charcoal created by pyrolysis of biomass.
The resulting charcoal-like material is a form of biosequestration or atmospheric carbon capture and storage.

In a new book on climate change preparedness, forthcoming from MIT Press this fall, Steve Schneider and his Stanford colleague Michael Mastrandrea argue that we need to start adapting to climate change, now.
They write that these efforts should focus primarily on identifying the places and people most at risk and taking anticipatory action.
They reject the approach of reactive, unplanned adaptation.
They call for dealing equitably with the needs of the most vulnerable people worldwide, who are least able to pay and least responsible for the looming crisis.
On August 30, Climate Science Watch director Rick Piltz was interviewed on Al Jazeera English TV as part of their coverage of the important new report by the InterAcademy Council on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
The report calls for a number of needed changes in management, structure, procedure, and communications, to strengthen the IPCC in producing complex climate change assessments and to forestall further damage to the organization’s perceived credibility.
An Albemarle County Circuit Court judge has set aside a subpoena issued by Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli to the University of Virginia seeking documents related to the work of climate scientist and former university professor Michael Mann, the Washington Post has reported.
This May, CSW attended the National Academy of Science’s (NAS) release of the first three reports from the America’s Climate Choices suite of studies: Advancing the Science of Climate Change, Limiting the Magnitude of Future Climate Change, and Adapting to the Impacts of Climate Change.
Since then, the NAS has released a fourth report, Informing Effective Decisions and Actions Related to Climate Change, and the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) has hosted webinars on three of the four reports.
On August 23 we tuned into the the final UCS webinar, a discussion of the Adapting to the Impacts of Climate Change report - a report focused largely on drawing our attention to the importance of adapting to irreversible climate change.
The spate of extreme weather events worldwide this summer has raised the profile of a major issue in climate change science: how does global warming impact weather and climate extremes?
Increases in the frequency and severity of climate and weather extremes have been observed over the last fifty years, including droughts, heavy precipitation events, extreme temperatures, and intense tropical cyclone activity in the North Atlantic, and are projected to continue.
However, most atmospheric scientists will not claim a given extreme weather event as “proof” of human influence on the climate based on the current evidence, and research continues on the complexities of attributing climate change to human activities versus natural climate variability.
A new international research initiative will seek to elevate the priority and visibility of attribution activities, and create a “research activity and a framework for an ‘operational’ activity, that sets forth a goal of providing a lot more concrete information in near real time about what has happened and why in weather and climate.”
On August 13, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a petition for judicial review to challenge the legality of the EPA’s decision not to reconsider its determination that greenhouse gases pose a threat to human health and welfare and are to be regulated under the Clean Air Act.
While claiming that the lawsuit “does not address the science of climate change,” the Chamber has a history of questioning climate science to fight off regulation, including the assertion that warming of even 3 degrees Celsius over the next century would be “beneficial to humans” and a call to put “the science of climate change on trial.”
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in an interview on Pakistan TV, said “there is a linkage” between the recent spate of deadly natural disasters and climate change… “We are changing the climate of the world.” Notwithstanding the scientific complexities of attribution of patterns of meterological events to ongoing global climatic disruption, and how this relationship can be most appropriately framed in public communication, this is an interesting high-level Obama Administration statement.
To what extent does Secretary Clinton’s statement suggest a commitment by the President to substantial follow-on policy responses, both to immediate events and to developing adaptive preparedness for anticipated consequences of climatic change over time?
After hearing oral argument August 20 on the University of Virginia’s petition to block Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli’s document demands relating to research of former UVa climate scientist Michael Mann, Judge Peatross ruled that he would need more time to make a decision.
One has to wonder how many Virginia voters are following this story and finding Cuccinelli’s anti-science inquisition offensive, or realizing how retrograde it makes their state look to have a right-wing prosecutorial zealot as Attorney General.
University of Virginia faculty, students and alumni will gather Friday afternoon August 20 to protest against Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli’s witch hunt against former UVA Professor and leading climate scientist Michael Mann.
The protest is timed to coincide with the ruling of a Virginia Circuit Court judge who is set to rule on whether to allow Cuccinelli’s frivolous investigation to continue.
Informing an Effective Response to Climate Change, the latest report in the National Research Council’s America’s Climate Choices suite of studies, is a commendable effort to draw more attention to an issue that is often overlooked in mainstream climate policy discussions: the tools, networks, and coordination needed to build a national response to climate change and inform climate decisions at all levels.
On August 8 we talked with Al Jazeera in connection with their prominent coverage of 2010’s wave of extreme weather—flooding in Asia, heat wave and wildfires in Russia, and record temperatures in many parts of the globe.
Are these events a sign of human-caused climate change?

The sheer number, depth, and breadth of the climate science assessments and U.S. government program reports released each year can be daunting, so we prepared an annotated guide to clarify the distinctions among some of the key reports: State of the Climate 2009; America’s Climate Choices; Fifth U.S. Climate Action Report; Our Changing Planet; Global Climate Change Impacts on the United States; U.S. National Assessment of the Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change; and Climate Change 2007: Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
In terms of what the research might suggest about the world of several decades hence, the paper in question doesn't materially change the picture painted in reports from such bodies as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) .
This is not just a climate issue.
Human population growth, growing demand for water, and declining biodiversity are other issues wrapped up in the warnings of a coming food crisis.
Last month, on the occasion of Stephen Schneider 's death, I blogged on the extraordinary vitriol to which he and some of his fellow climate scientists have been subjected.
When Tim visited the site, three years had passed since the spill, and there were few signs of oil to be found.
With the Deepwater Horizon leak fresh in mind, and questions abounding over whether its environmental effect has been exaggerated , his article made instructive reading.
It's the last of the major inquiries and reviews surrounding climate science that were commissioned in the wake of "ClimateGate" , "HimalayaGate" and so on - and probably the most important, as it could significantly affect how the organisation pursues its work towards its fifth major assessment of climate change, due out in 2013.
With ever more hungry mouths on the planet, with soils degrading in many places and with climate change threatening to reduce yields in coming decades, there's renewed interest in the ancient technology, which has been championed by James Lovelock of Gaia fame among others.
What's proposed would be nothing less than a revolution in the way we handle waste - turning it from waste into fuel, fertiliser and climate saviour with a single blast of the charcoal oven.
A group of researchers that includes Johannes Lehmann of Cornell University , the closest thing biochar has to a spiritual father, has attempted to calculate just how much impact the technology could have on climate change if societies all over the world transformed their waste streams into biochar production facilities - "the maximum sustainable technical potential of biochar to mitigate climate change".
The researchers identify six ways in which biochar curbs emissions, including reducing methane production from decaying plant waste, reducing nitrous oxide release from soils , and avoiding carbon dioxide emissions by storing carbon in the soil.
Put in these terms, you might ask why we aren't doing it already.
On the surface, biochar is a win-win-win technology: a win for the climate, a win for food production, and a win for reduction of the human waste stream.
After all, pretty much everyone involved in Redd (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) thinks that is a good idea, but we still don't have a global system for making it happen.
The key factoid presented by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) is that about three-quarters of the 4.9 million barrels that entered the Gulf waters has been dealt with.

Uh oh.
I trust Joe Romm on climate — and his verdict on Superfreakonomics is pretty damning.
I’ll get to work on the book myself, but it doesn’t look good.
A follow-up to the bestselling book "Freakonomics" features a chapter that grossly mischaracterizes climate science, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists.
The new book, "SuperFreakonomics" by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner, is slated to be officially released on October 20, 2009.
Experts at UCS found that the fifth chapter of the book, "Global Cooling," repeats a large number of easily discredited arguments regarding climate science, energy production, and geoengineering.
The authors appear to have taken a purposefully contrarian position on climate change science and economics.
While such a position may help draw attention to their book, their reliance on faulty arguments and distorted statistics does a disservice to their readers.
We have a chapter in SuperFreakonomics about global warming and it too will likely produce a lot of shouting, name-calling, and accusations ranging from idiocy to venality.
It is curious that the global-warming arena is so rife with shrillness and ridicule.
Ms. Ostrom, who teaches at Indiana University in Bloomington, Ill., is the first woman to win the prize, which, before Monday, had been awarded to 62 men since it was launched in 1969 to celebrate the 300th anniversary of the Swedish bank.
The judges cited "her analysis of economic governance, especially the commons," the way in which natural resources are managed as shared resources.
It is an area of research that she said was relevant to questions surrounding global warming, and suggests that decisions by individuals can help solve the problem even as governments work to reach an international agreement.
Ms. Ostrom "challenged the conventional wisdom that common property is poorly managed and should be either regulated by central authorities or privatized," the Nobel judges said.
"Based on numerous studies of user-managed fish stocks, pastures, woods, lakes, and groundwater basins, [Ms.] Ostrom concludes that the outcomes are, more often than not, better than predicted by standard theories.
She observes that resource users frequently develop sophisticated mechanisms for decision-making and rule enforcement to handle conflicts of interest, and she characterizes the rules that promote successful outcomes.

Climatologist Martin Mozny of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute and colleagues say that the quality of Saaz hops - the delicate variety used to make pilsner lager - has been decreasing in recent years.
They say the culprit is climate change in the form of increased air temperature.
Mozny's team used a high-resolution dataset of weather patterns, crop yield and hop quality to estimate the impact of climate change on Saaz hops in the Czech Republic between 1954 and 2006.
Best-quality Saaz hops contain about 5 per cent alpha acid, the compound that produces the delicate, bitter taste of pilsners.
The study found that the concentration of alpha acids in Saaz hops has fallen by 0.06 per cent a year since 1954, and models of hop yields and quality under future global warming scenarios predict bigger decreases (Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, DOI: 10.1016/j.agrformet.2009.02.006 ).
Duke Energy has spent more than $10 million to lobby Congress since 2008 as electric utilities ratchet up spending to help shape new laws on climate change and other issues.
Its chief target: legislation to cap emissions of carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas linked to global warming.
Duke's fleet of coal-fired power plants makes it the nation's third-highest CO2 emitter among U.S. utilities. ...
Duke was hardly alone in a lobbying frenzy stoked by the climate legislation.
About 1,150 companies and advocacy groups - from biofuel advocates to religious associations - lobbied Congress in the weeks before the June vote in the House, says the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit investigative journalism group.
With enough technological advances, the world could get to a dramatically lower level of greenhouse gas emissions at a cost of between one and three percent of global GDP per year, according to a report issued Tuesday by a group of economists.
That price tag is in line with previous economic estimates aimed at meeting more modest climate goals.
Frank Ackerman, an economist at the Stockholm Environment Institute and Tufts University and the report's lead author, said the study looked at what it would take to meet the recommendations of climate scientists who call for reducing carbon atmospheric concentrations from their current level to 350 parts per million.
However Robert J. Shapiro, chairman of the U.S. Climate Task Force and Sonecon, an economic advisory group, said the goal of reducing carbon concentrations below their current levels is unrealistic.
"The only prospect of reaching 350 is if we came to develop a technology that would pull greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere -- that is, pull the concentrations out of the atmosphere," Shapiro said.
"That is probably impossible without a technology that we can only conceive of today.
"

Climate change: the state of the debate
While awareness seems to have risen steadily, levels of public concern have ebbed and flowed, with a range of flashpoints driving surges of interest.
As the shocks of the 1970s receded, media coverage of climate change tended to fall.
Extreme weather impacts on the scale of the 1972 spike had not been repeated, and fears of a potentially imminent catastrophe eased.
Other environmental issues did, though, make an impression – notably rainforests, acid rain and (later) the ‘ozone hole’ over Antarctica, which led quickly to the agreement of the 1987 Montreal Protocol on ozone-depleting substances.
And then, in the summer of 1988, public concern over climate change reignited dramatically.
Heat waves and droughts were already flaring up when NASA scientist James Hansen made his famous appearance before a Congressional committee chaired by Senator Tim Wirth as, outside the building, temperatures reached an all-time high.
Hansen said to journalists afterwards that it was time to “stop waffling, and say that the evidence is pretty strong that the greenhouse effect is here”.
As the summer wore on – with Hurricane Gilbert, the worst forest fires in a century and the Mississippi River falling so low that barge traffic was halted – the media leapt on climate change as never before.
The number of American newspaper articles about global warming rose tenfold between 1987 and 1988; and by September 1988, polling found that 58 per cent of Americans had heard or read about the greenhouse effect.
But, as in the aftermath of the 1972 spike, the scientific community had emerged more energised than before.
This time, there was a tangible outcome, which would in retrospect prove a decisive moment in establishing climate change as a global challenge of the first rank.
For in 1988, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was set up – not least in order to come up with a clearer and more definitive statement of what scientists did (and did not) think about climate change.
At the Villach workshop, a group of scientists, acting in a personal capacity, announced a consensus that “in the first half of the next century a rise of global mean temperature would occur which is greater than any in man’s history.” The need to deepen, extend and institutionalise this consensus was pushed in particular by the United States government – in part because it wanted to ‘buy time’ and delay a potentially costly policy response.
The US wanted an inter-governmental mechanism and that’s what it got.
According to Agrawala, this formal insertion of scientific expertise was of great importance.
The result was to pump sufficient shared awareness of the climate problem into the international arena, providing a platform for governments to enter into a serious negotiation.

By 1989, another poll found that 79% of the public had heard of the greenhouse effect: survey of public by Research Strategy/Management Inc., 'Global Warming and Energy Priorities,' Union of Concerned Scientists, 11/89, as reported in W. Kempton, "Global Environmental Change," 6/91
Unfortunately, hydroelectricity has its drawbacks.
By blocking rivers with massive dams, we have created a number of serious environmental and social problems, including habitat destruction, prevention of fish passage, and displacement of local communities.
Still, if it's done right, hydropower can be a sustainable and nonpolluting power source that can help decrease our dependence on fossil fuels and reduce the threat of global warming.
An important issue now in the United States is the re-licensing of hydropower plants.
Hydro plants have very long lives; the Grand Coulee dam, for example, has been in operation since 1942.
The federal government issues licenses for all dams for a 30- to 50-year period.
In 1993, for instance, over 200 licenses were due for renewal, amounting to 2,000 MW of capacity.
Re-licensing some of these dams should require dam owners to find ways to reduce environmental impacts.
Unfortunately, in the 2005 Energy Policy Act, the hydropower licensing law was amended as part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, making it more difficult for the public to participate in the re-licensing process.
[11]
Although an inexpensive and nonpolluting energy resource, the environmental damage caused hydropower can be serious.
The most obvious effect is that fish are blocked from moving up and down the river, but there are many more problems.
Dams can create large reservoirs submerging what used to be dry land, producing many problems.
The Balbina dam in Brazil, for example, flooded 2,750 square kilometers (965 square miles), an area the size of Rhode Island.
This land is often composed of wetlands, which are important wildlife habitats, and low-lying flood plains, usually the most fertile crop land in the area.
Population density is typically higher along rivers, leading to mass dislocation of urban centers.
The Three Gorges Dam in China is expected to dislocate up to 1.9 million people.
[16]
Wildlife habitats destroyed by reservoirs can be especially valuable.
In South America, 80 percent of the hydroelectric potential is located in rain forests, one of the most rich and diverse ecosystems on Earth.
The Rosana dam in Brazil destroyed one of the few remaining habitats of the black-lion tamarin, a rare and beautiful species of long-haired monkey.
Another problem can occur when the land area behind the dam is flooded without proper preparation.
In Brazil, the Tucurui dam was built creating a reservoir in a rain forest region, without the forest first being cleared.
Later, as the plants and trees that were submerged began to rot, they reduced the oxygen content of the water, killing off the plants and fish in the water.
Moreover, the rotting plants gave off large quantities of methane, a powerful global warming gas.
A similar problem has occurred in Canada, in hydro projects built by Hydro Quebec.
The stones and soil in the flooded area contain naturally occurring mercury and other metals.
When the land was flooded, the mercury dissolved into the water, and then into the local fish populations.
The creatures that eat the fish—from bears and eagles, to the native Cree people—are suffering from mercury poisoning.
Mercury poisoning can cause brain damage, birth defects, liver disorders, and other ailments.
Impoundments used for hydropower can cause many other effects on water quality and aquatic life.
Rivers and lakes can be filled with sediment from erosion.
Water falling over spillways can force air bubbles into the water, which can be absorbed into fish tissue, ultimately killing the fish.
By slowing down rivers, the water can become stratified, with warm water on top and cold water on the bottom.
Since the cold water is not exposed to the surface, it loses its oxygen and becomes uninhabitable for fish.
And as illustrated by the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon, fast-moving rivers can be filled up with sediment when they are slowed down.
In an effort to mitigate this problem, the Department of Interior has flushed huge amounts of water out of dams in an attempt to clear away the sediment.
The risk of a dam breaking should also not be ignored.
The great Johnstown flood in Pennsylvania was the result of a dam break (although not a hydroelectric dam); 2,000 people were killed.
In northern India and Nepal, in the Himalayas, huge hydroelectric projects are planned that would create large reservoirs in a geographically unstable region.
Frequent earthquakes make the dam a risky venture for heavily populated areas downstream.
This is compounded by the fear that large, heavy reservoirs would put additional pressure on the plates in the region, causing even more earthquakes.
Finally, breakage could also result from war or terrorism, as dams have been considered potential military targets in the past.
The environmental and social effects of hydropower can be immense.
But while hydropower has its problems, it can still be a safe and sustainable source of electricity if proper measures are taken.
By upgrading and improving the equipment at plants, by increasing fish-friendly efforts at dams, and by improving run-of-the-river turbine technology, it may be possible to reduce the environmental effects of hydropower.
Nonetheless, remediation may be impossible at some sites, and wild rivers should be unshackled.
It is also important to compare the environmental effects of hydropower with alternatives.
The damage to aquatic habitat from dams may be significant, but acid rain, nitrogen deposition, and thermal pollution from coal plants also lead to aquatic damage, as well as to air pollution and global warming.
Provided we dismantle the worst hydropower facilities, and improve the sustainability of the others, we will be better off.
To be certified, a facility must adequately protect or mitigate its impacts in the following areas: river flows, water quality, fish passage and protection, watershed protection, threatened and endangered species protection, cultural resource protection, and recreation.
The incentive for certification is the ability to market a more sustainable energy source to consumers, especially those participating in voluntary green power programs.
In addition, Pennsylvania requires hydroelectric projects to be LIHI certified in order to be eligible to count towards the state's renewable electricity standard.
Currently, more than twenty hydropower facilities have been LIHI certified.

The Climate Change Adaptation Partnerships Program is part of Australia’s Farming Future.
The Australian Government will work with research and development organisations, state governments and industry bodies to provide a framework for primary industries to adapt to climate change and manage their emissions.
Funding will be provided for:
Research and development funding will help to prepare the agriculture sector to manage emissions and encourage on-farm adaptation and adjustment to climate change.
This element of the program will be delivered jointly with the Climate Change and Productivity Research Program.
Divided by the East African Rift Valley into highlands and lowlands, Ethiopia has an extraordinarily diverse climate, from the cool and rainy Dega highlands to the Danakil depression – one of the hottest, driest places on Earth.
The economy is based on agriculture, which accounts for half GDP, 60 per cent of exports and 80 per cent of total employment.
But only 1 per cent of farmed land is irrigated and drought can throw the whole country into crisis and food shortage.
According to Abebe Tadege, head of research at the national meteorological office in Addis Ababa: “There have been signs of climate change in Ethiopia since 2000, and even before.
Tropical Africa is a hotspot for precipitation changes.
I am very worried.
What is the impact on crops, on tef [the traditional staple], tea, coffee, livestock?”
With five major droughts in two decades, many families have not had time to recover and hundreds of thousands of people live on the brink of survival every year.
In 2000–3, 46% of the population were malnourished, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization.
Meanwhile 2006 saw some of the worst floods in Ethiopia’s history, displacing people all over the country.
Flash floods in Dire Dawa, the second largest city after Addis Ababa, killed nearly 250 people and displaced thousands.
More than 400 people died during outbreaks of acute watery diarrhoea in 2006.
Fadis, in the east, has been badly hit by drought.
Many farmers have suffered from poor harvests year after year due to erratic rainfall.
In recent years the rains have failed completely.
The nearby River Boco, which used to be one of the main sources for irrigation in the area dried up several years ago, partly because of the lack of rainfall.
Yusuf remembers orange and lemon groves beside the river.
He reports that many people in his community migrate every year because of drought, and scarcity of food and water.
Fatiya Abatish Jacob is a local trader who lived near the lake for 14 years: “I used to get my drinking water from the lake, now I have to walk eight kilometres to get it.
Also there were many vegetables farmers round here using the water for irrigation and we used to get fish.
Now there are no fish around here and vegetables are more expensive.”
And while there was drought in Harar area to the south there were bad floods in 2006 in west Shoa, where 3,000 people were displaced.
“Such heavy flooding hasn’t happened for 40 years,” says Tiringo Engdawork, Ethiopian Red Cross Society (ERCS) branch secretary.
“It destroyed houses, crops and cattle.” Local malaria rates have shot up.
ERCS disaster preparedness emphasizes clean water and tree planting for wood, fruit and terracing.
Gabriel Aebachew, head of organizational development, believes that they have to now “create awareness of climate change, collect data and train volunteers” at branch level.
The ERCS also has a programme of community based health care for awareness-raising and education, but this will have to be scaled up in the light of climate change.
Malaria, typhoid, cholera and diarrhoea are all diseases that spread more rapidly during times of hardship.

What risk is acceptable in establishing “safe” global warming goals, policies and actions?
In the absence of a well-informed scientific consensus that harm would not ensue, the precautionary principle suggests that if an action (or inaction) might cause severe or irreversible harm to the public or the environment, the burden of proof falls on those advocating the action (or inaction).
For nuclear power stations in the USA, the regulatory standard is that there should be no more that one-in-amillion risk of serious accident.
In 2004, the chance of being killed in a commercial air crash was about one in four million.
If instead the risk was one in a thousand — a 0.1% chance — we would not fly.
Yet we seem to accept much higher risks as reasonable in setting global warming targets.
The talk is about a 20–30% species loss for a rise of 2°C, very likely coral reef destruction , possible ice-sheet disintegration and the prospects of economic damage “on a scale similar to those associated with the great wars and the economic depression of the first half of the 20th century” (according to Nicholas Stern) as if it were a game of chance, a poker hand where with an ounce of luck the right cards will be dealt and the Earth will “get out of jail” free.
It seems that we abide by one rule when our own personal safety is at risk, but apply a much lower standard when it comes to the planet on whose good grace our own survival rests.
The precautionary principle tells us to not risk actions that could trigger an irreversible chain of climate change events or produce dangerous impacts.
We cannot gamble on how far we can push the system till it breaks, and then try and unscramble the eggs.
As is the case for civil aviation, climate change safety policy must allow for less than a one-in-a-million chance of catastrophic failure.
Because biodiversity, our lives, and those of succeeding generations are at stake, we must not choose to accept a level of warming that creates an unacceptable risk of unacceptable impacts.
We need a model of the precautionary principle that not only guides us to avoid unsustainability, but that also guides us to get back to the safe zone if we have strayed outside that zone already.
Yet risk and uncertainty have been turned on their head: “The risk-averse nature of Article 2 of the UNFCCC (UN Framework Convention on Climate Change) requires immediate and stringent reductions in emissions of all greenhouse gases because of scientific uncertainty, not in spite of uncertainty.
Uncertainty, however, has been used as a reason for delay of emission reductions, presumably on the grounds that future knowledge may show that near-term emission reductions are unnecessary” (Harvey, 2007).
The 1992 UNFCCC urges stabilisation of greenhouse gases at a level: to “prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system”; to be achieved within a time frame “sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change; to ensure that food production is not threatened; and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner”.
Climate ‘code red’: The case for a sustainability emergency 25 While the concept of “dangerous” is generally cast into the future — for example, at a 2°C rise — other judges, such as the inhabitants of low-lying Pacific islands, know it is already dangerous.
And they note their “strong belief that such broad-based, multi-metric approaches to impacts categorization and assessment are vastly preferable to focusing solely on market categories of damages, as is often done by traditional cost–benefit analyses.
‘One metric’ aggregations probably underestimate the seriousness of climate impacts.” Pragmatically, there will be no easy agreement between nations as to what the definition of dangerous will be, nor will quantities or caps be established.
But the effort must be made to get a genuinely ‘good enough’ consensus because the stakes are so high.
Of particular significance as a metric is the triggering of irreversible chains of events, or “tipping points”.
The climate system “is highly non-linear and is prone to abrupt changes, threshold effects and irreversible changes (in a human time frame) very small changes in a forcing factor can trigger surprisingly large and sometimes catastrophic changes in a system [and] propel the Earth into a different climatic and environmental state.
Examples include the rapid disintegration of the large ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica or large-scale and uncontrollable feedbacks in the carbon cycle: activation of methane clathrates buried under the coastal seas, the rapid loss of methane from warmer and drier tundra ecosystems, increasing wildfires in the boreal and tropical zones, the conversion of the Amazon rainforest to a savannah and the release of CO2 from warming soils.
Once a critical threshold was crossed and such a series of processes was triggered, no policy or management approaches could slow or reverse the process” (Steffen, 2007).
An example is the “imminent peril” we now face of “initiation of dynamical and thermodynamical processes on the West Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets that produce a situation out of humanity’s control, such that devastating sea level rise will inevitably occur” (Hansen, Sato et al., 2007b).
“A tipping point occurs when the climate state is such that, because of large ‘ready’ feedbacks, small additional forcing can cause large climate change.
The ready feedbacks today are provided by Arctic , the West Antarctic ice sheet, and much of the Greenland ice.
Little additional forcing is needed to trigger these feedbacks because of global warming that is already in the pipeline Casualties of passing this tipping point would include more than wildlife and indigenous ways of life in the Arctic, and the coastal environments and cities submerged by rising seas.
The increased global warming Climate ‘code red’: The case for a sustainability emergency 26 would have world-wide effects via an intensified hydrologic cycle” (Hansen, 2008).
Thus “tipping points is not only a valid concept, but it is what distinguishes the global warming problem from other problems such as the (particulate) air pollution problem the upshot is a real danger that the system will run out of our control [and] these changes will become unavoidable.
As we realized years ago, we cannot ‘wait and see’ in the climate problem.
We have to be smart enough to understand what is happening early on” (Hansen, 2007d).
So what does it mean to “prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system”?
We suggest the goal is a climate safe for all people and all species over “all” generations, and we should not discount knowable impacts beyond our own lifetime.
The world has already overshot this goal.
We have already moved beyond a safe-climate planet and global warming is now causing species extinction and taking a toll in human lives.
So how much damage from climate change are we prepared to tolerate?
We can only answer “the least amount possible” and certainly not levels that will overwhelm human and other species’ capacity to cope.
One has only to read or watch day-by-day reports in the media to understand that dangerous climate change is already here.
Looking at Darfur, the farmers along Australia’s failing Murray–Darling river system, collapsing ecosystems, the victims of the 2007 Greek and Californian mega-fires, the coral stress, the species lost, the changing patterns of the Asian monsoons, the fate of low-lying Pacific island communities and food production decline in sub-Saharan Africa, our world is already at the point of failing to cope.
The United Nation’s emergency relief coordinator, Sir John Holmes, warned that 12 of the 13 major relief operations in 2007 were climate related and said this amounted to a climate change “mega disaster” (Borger, 2007).
Climate change is already dangerous.

In upcoming but closely related action, EPA will impose the first ever federally-mandated requirements that coal-fired electric utilities reduce their emissions of mercury.
Together the Clean Air Mercury Rule and the Clean Air Interstate Rule create a multi-pollutant strategy to reduce emissions throughout the United States.
The Bush Administration continues to believe that the President’s Clear Skies legislation is a more efficient, effective, long-term mechanism to achieve large-scale national reductions.
Clear Skies legislation applies nationwide and is modeled on the highly successful Acid Rain Program.
The Agency remains committed to working with Congress to pass legislation
I think the problem with the CAIR benefit-cost analysis is the definition of the baseline.
As I understand it, the baseline assumes that in 2020, absent CAIR, the level of air pollution would be the same as in 2000 (adjusted for income growth and population change).
The baseline does not account for additional decreases in pollution that are (or were) predicted to happen between 2000 and 2020.
This was a more obvious issue with the Clear Skies (the basis for CAIR) benefit-cost analysis, as it occured before the administration rescinded New Source Review.
The baseline for Clear Skies assumed no pollution reductions from 2000 levels.
This wasn't realistic, given the existence of NSR.
Therefore the benefit-cost analysis for Clear Skies overstated the benefits.
I think the same issue pertains to CAIR, although it's less obvious now that NSR is gone.
The issue isn't net benefits (even if CAIR overstates benefits, they'd still be greater than costs).
As I see it, the problem is that the administration is claiming a greater benefit from the program than really exists.
While it may be more cost-efficient (via tradable permits) than NSR and other command and control programs, the improvement in air quality is not that great compared to what would have happened anyway.
Cost-efficiency is good, but they're being misleading in claiming such high benefits.
Cost-efficiency is great, but the way the RIA is structured, it's impossible to tell if we're getting cost-efficiency with the same/better air quality as the old rule OR cost-efficiency plus worse air quality.
I don't think the numbers are as extreme as I made them in this example, but the baseline in the RIA is so misleading that it seems impossible to get an accurate sense of CAIR's effect on air quality.
These are similar to the complaints by environmentalists -- the Bush environmental agenda weakens environmental regs.
This seems to be true in the short run but not in the long run.
Economists seem to be very forgiving in this regard.
We seem to be willing to achieve certain air quality targets later in exchange for market based policies and the resulting efficiencies.
"Economists ... seem to be willing to achieve certain air quality targets later in exchange for market based policies and the resulting efficiencies.
"
I'm a big proponent of tradable permits, and I think NSR/command&control is inefficient.
But the way in which the RIA is constructed, it's impossible to get an accurate sense of what air quality would be without CAIR, ceteris paribus.
The calculation of benefits seems rigged in favor of the regulation, which defeats the purpose of benefit-cost analysis.
The same baseline issue came up with the 812 retrospective benefit-cost analysis of the Clean Air Act.
Benefits were huge compared to costs, and criticism of the analysis came from the right, which said that the air quality baseline was too high.
They acknowledged that if air quality was modelled using 1970-levels (adjusted for economic and population growth), air quality would have stunk by the 1990s and the baseline was correct in that sense.
Now I'm faced with a soul-searching question: Have environmental economists sold their soul to gain some cool marketable emissions permits programs?
In other words, do we care about efficiency (achieving the correct goal at the lowest cost) or cost-effectiveness (achieving any goal at the lowest cost)?
I'm inclined to think we're still interested in efficiency.
Again, I must trust the folks at RFF.
In the paper " Efficient emission fees in the U.S. electricity sector ," the RFF authors find that the Clear Skies proposal and competing D and R proposals are heading towards air quality targets that are about right for efficiency.
This paper provides new estimates of efficient emission fees for sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions in the US electricity sector.
The estimates are obtained by coupling a detailed simulation model of the US electricity markets with an integrated assessment model that links changes in emissions with atmospheric transport, environmental endpoints, and valuation of impacts.
Efficient fees are found by comparing incremental benefits with emission fee levels.
National quantity caps that are equivalent to these fees also are computed, and found to approximate caps under consideration in the current multi-pollutant debate in the US Congress and the recent proposals from the Bush administration for the electricity industry.
We also explore whether regional differentiation of caps on different pollutants is likely to enhance efficiency.
As much as I'd like to have the "correct goal" be set at the economically-optimal level of pollution, I think these sorts of social goals will always be determined by the political process rather than benefit-cost analysis.
I'll take a look at both RFF papers more carefully.
The one on their website, does have a discussion of how they defined the baseline on p. 31. There's a sentence that makes me doubt they did much different that the CAIR RIA ("The baseline scenario includes environmental policies that were already in effect at the time the modeling was done.
"), but I'll give them a closer look as soon as I can.

What’s the price of a pelican?
The total for a turtle?
The dollars for a dolphin?
Its not a philosophical question anymore.
The BP oil spill killed hundreds of these animals, and the Feds want to make darn sure that BP pays the total bill.
But coming up with a precise economic value for wildlife has stymied economists and scientists for decades.
There’s no market for most of these animals.
No catalog for endangered species.
No eBay or Craigslist for migratory birds.
...
Don’t tell an economist that you can’t put a value on the invaluable.
They’ll come up with an entire discipline to do it.
It’s called contingent valuation , and the theory is that if you ask the right way, people can asses how much a public resource is worth.
We talked to the man who put a price tag on a wild duck , Gardner Brown, of the University of Washington.
He used a survey of hunters to find out how much they would pay to take home an extra bird.
Could we use the same techniques to value a pelican?
In theory, Brown says.
But he notes that it would be difficult to get people to set aside their emotions about the oil spill and isolate how much they would actually pay to save the pelicans.
...
The Exxon Valdez contingent valuation study did it by developing a scenario to avoid a future Prince William Sound oil spill.
Gardner Brown is correct in saying that it is difficult to tell people how to respond to contingent valuation questions, but the method has been developed to the point where those emotional responses can be analyzed to purge the emotions.
All these failed valuation techniques are familiar turf for scientists at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service.
They’ve tried them all too.
Roger Helm with the agency says that they used to go to biological supply firms to put a price on dead fish.
They did surveys after the Exxon Valdez oil spill to value the wildlife lost.
But these days, the Feds do something different.
Instead of telling a company what they have to pay for dead animals, they just tell them they are required to restore the population of the animal.
47 dead pelicans?
The company has to pay for enough habitat or conservation programs to bring back 47 pelicans.
And that could be cheap or very, very expensive.
Helm has an elegant answer to the question of what a pelican is worth: the price of a pelican is exactly one pelican.
Since you're getting meta on your readers, maybe a little meta in return is warranted.
I feel as though I've learned a lot about the way your mind works through this blog -- along with a thing or two about your temperament.
Mostly I'm impressed with the range of your thinking, the strength of your convictions, and the accuracy of your predictions.
Your courageous voice is a very welcome one in the current climate.
Michigan's governor yesterday sharply criticized attempts to contain a large oil spill making its way down the Kalamazoo River after the company responsible for the spill said it had redoubled its efforts to clean up the mess.
Gov.
Jennifer Granholm asked the federal government for more help, saying that resources being marshaled by the federal Environmental Protection Agency and Enbridge Inc. are "wholly inadequate.
"
Now to see if the folks at Environmental Economics let me have it over this .
. .
they are, after all, real economists.
We need less talk about “climate” and more about how conservation saves money, renewable energy creates jobs, restoring the gulf’s marshes sustains fishermen and preserving the rainforest helps poor people.
The bulk of today's article is about the good news that the BP oil spill seems to be much less worse than feared and the bad news that the U.S. Senate won't pass climate change legislation.
The quote above is from the last paragraph.

With an uninterrupted 17-million year sediment record of Antarctic’s climatic past now available, scientists are hoping for unique new insights into the continent’s climatic past.
Antarctica’s ice sheets, so it seems, respond more sensitively to climate fluctuations than has been assumed.
During warmer periods, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and its floating extension, the western Ross Ice Shelf, have shrunk substantially.
Some 3.5 million years ago the ice seems to have disappeared completely for around 200,000 years.
There were snow-capped mountains, alpine trees, gushing rivers, quiet lakes – the frozen continent was a place where you would love to go fishing or hiking, were it not for the midges.
A paper in Nature Geoscience this week (subscription required) serves up an important figure for climate modellers: the size of the greenhouse effect caused by ozone near the Earth's surface, estimated from direct observations.
Whereas 20 years ago the discovery that the stratospheric ozone layer was thinning led to international prohibitions on ozone-eating chemicals, this new study reflects concerns about excess ozone produced nearer to the ground, in the troposphere, by reacting pollutants .
Tropospheric ozone is a greenhouse gas - and although carbon dioxide still gets the most column inches, other greenhouse gases such as ozone (see also methane ) are drawing more and more scientific attention.
Previously, the best estimates of the radiative forcing from ozone - its planet-warming power - came from simulations.
The latest IPCC report used several such models to assess forcing from anthropogenic ozone alone, excluding ozone from natural sources, and came up with a range of values from 0.25 to 0.65 watts per square metre (in comparison, forcing by all anthropogenic greenhouse gases together was estimated at 1.6 watts per square metre).
Now, NASA's Aura satellite has collected enough measurements of infrared radiation and ozone thickness in cloudless patches of sky to pin down the combined effects of natural and human-produced ozone.
According to these data, the global average forcing in the year 2006 was 0.48 (+/- 0.14) watts per square metre.
No surprises, but a palpable step forward in the hardworking and sometimes underappreciated field of Earth observation.
The current issue of Nature has a feature about the state of the Greenland ice sheet (See also the related editorial dealing with the state of polar research funding).
I got started on this story at the American Geophysical Union meeting last December , in which session after session presented new data about the extent of summer melt in Greenland.
Information from the GRACE satellites shows that the overall mass balance of the ice sheet is dropping steadily, and although surface melt varies quite a bit from summer to summer, two of the last three years have seen record levels of melt.
The basic point of the two new papers -- that vast quantities of meltwater can form and then drain away atop the ice sheet each summer – made it into my feature anyway.
But if you want more details, check out the original papers at the Science Express website .
One paper , with lead author Sarah Das of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, reports on a 4-kilometre-long melt lake that vanished into the ice sheet within the space of two hours.
The other , with lead author Ian Joughin of the University of Washington’s Applied Physics Laboratory, describes seasonal speed-up in ice flow along Greenland’s western flank – though not so much in the outlet glaciers.
Together, the papers confirm how meltwater likely helps lubricate the slippage of the ice sheet towards the ocean.
And if you just need a fix of gorgeous Greenland pictures, click on over to the Extreme Ice Survey project of photographer James Balog and others.
We used only one of Balog’s iceberg images in my Nature feature, but his time-lapse work of melting glaciers is stunning.
All-in-all, the missions represent an unprecedented effort to collect global climate data from space.
While this is fascinating from a scientific perspective, it should also have some interesting political implications by enabling the easy identification of climate culprits.
“If one were to imagine a way to monitor or verify [emissions], then this would be the way to go”, says Miller.
For instance, it should quash (or raise, depending on who you’re talking to) fears that nations claiming credits for avoiding deforestation under the Kyoto Protocol will be able to divert the problem elsewhere.
The North Atlantic Ocean may still be an active storehouse for atmospheric carbon dioxide, said scientists at the European Geosciences Union here in Vienna yesterday.
Scientists have feared that the weakening trend could be a long-term impact of global warming and that it could be typical of the ocean as a whole, which absorbs an estimated 25 per cent of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions yearly.
If the ocean switches from a storehouse to a source of the greenhouse gas, this would jeopardise efforts to stabilise atmospheric greenhouse gas levels.
Speaking at a press conference at the EGU assembly yesterday, Ute Schuster from the University of East Anglia in Norwich, UK and Christoph Heinze at the University of Bergen, Norway, presented the results of a yearly analysis of carbon dioxide fluxes across the North Atlantic Ocean.
Previously, Schuster and colleagues showed that carbon uptake by the North Atlantic had halved between the mid-1990s and the early 21st century.
But further analysis of the data on a year-by-year basis has shown that the uptake of carbon dioxide in the region has been increasing since 2002 and showed an even greater increase, relative to the early 2000s, in 2005.
The reasons for this variation are unclear.
“I personally think we can’t say with confidence that the trend [in weakening sinks] is attributable to [anthropogenic] climate change”, says Schuster.
Surface circulation in the North Atlantic has changed in recent years, she says, but these changes could be due to natural climate variability.
Specifically, the North Atlantic Oscillation, a large-scale atmospheric pattern that has important impacts on European climate, could be influencing the rate of carbon dioxide uptake.
Sick of fractious climate blogging?
MIT researcher Mark Klein and his colleagues are envisioning a souped-up new forum on global warming - described as "simultaneously a kind of Wikipedia for controversial topics, a Sims game for the future of the planet, and an electronic democracy on steroids" - that they say could reshape public discourse.
It's called the Climate Collaboratorium .
Here's what it might look like, in part:
Klein is now starting more tests with Swiss and Italian students that will evaluate whether the Collaboratorium produces superior content and better-informed participants compared with ordinary wikis and forums.
How to arrange for quality control in the project's next phase, however, is still something of an open question.
Climate modeller and RealClimate blogger Gavin Schmidt (who's recently defended climate blogging in Nature Geoscience (subscription) and on RealClimate ) told Inman* that generating respect for an open forum on climate "is by far the most challenging aspect of this proposal".
Doubtless, many top climate scientists - who may at times volunteer half their workload toward the IPCC reports already - wouldn't get around to participating in the fledgling project.
Fortunately, they do have grad students .
The fully realized Collaboratorium, as outlined in this paper by Klein and collaborator Thomas Malone, would be even more ambitious.
Their vision relies heavily, for example, on users building their own climate models that are integrally linked to the speculation and debate going on in the argument tree.
Above all, though, Malone and Klein stress the need for a more powerful tool to help us get our collective heads around climate change:
What do you think, climate debaters?
Could a more sophisticated approach force out a high-quality product?
Yesterday evening , we held a 'Meet the Editors' event at the Nature stand here at the European Geosciences Union conference, and invited scientists to join editors from Nature Geoscience and Nature Reports Climate Change for beer and pretzels.
Why did you cover such and such a story in Nature or on Nature Reports Climate Change?
(geoengineering was a big one here; I guess readers were curious about why we might cover something that's still quite conceptual, such as the Lovelock and Rapley proposal ).
Personally, I think such topics are worthy of discussion within the scientific community especially at the conceptual stage.
I for one, am interested in whether our readers think that research efforts and funding should be directed towards such big potential solutions with high risk of failure).
Scientists at the European Geosciences Union annual conference in Vienna today proposed the idea of using customised engineering for highly specific purposes – such as reversing sea level rise and preventing hurricanes.
The discussions took place in the first ever geoengineering session at an EGU annual assembly, held in recognition of the fact that it just may be time to start considering the need for a climate emergency response system, should our mitigation efforts fail to work...or indeed, fail to kick off.
Although the concept of manually interfering with the Earth’s climate on a large scale has been the subject of much controversy, not least in the pages of Nature , less attention has been given to such bespoke geoengineering to tackle specific potential impacts.
In a proof-of-concept trial in the Southern Ocean, Wingenter and colleagues showed that fertilizing just 2% of the Southern Ocean could prevent net ice loss and reduce thermal expansion in the region enough to slow sea level rise.
Climate change and energy occupy sizeable slots on this year's programme; hence my schlep across to Austria to meet with some of the authors behind the 12,000 abstracts.
Following from a spate of recent coverage in Nature and on NRCC , the threat of a warming world on global water resources emerged here today as one of the issues du jour.
This time, the question was whether the world's water supplies from mountains and highlands, known as the world's natural "water towers", will still be able to quench our thirst in fifty years.
Given that 70% of the world's population is based in lowland regions with natural "water towers" providing both drinking water and faciliatating food production, many millions could be affected.
Carmen de Jong, a research scientist who works on the Europena Alps, said that in some areas where glaciers are small, the water supply from high elevations could be gone in 30 years time unless there is enough precipitation in summer time to compensate for the loss.
I'll be blogging throughout the week until the conference ends on Friday, so tune in here daily for the highlights on climate change and energy from EGU 2008.
My colleague Quirin Schiermeier will also be blogging over on the Nature's In the Field blog with coverage from the climate and energy streams and more.
James Hansen and Michael McCracken - two extremely prominent and vocal climate scientists - have rallied behind a US high-school senior who questioned statements in his civics textbook that play up scientific uncertainty on global warming.
Now the book's publisher, Houghton Mifflin, is promising to reassess its accuracy ( AP , Dot Earth , Grist , Treehugger ).
From the AP :
Legal scholars and top scientists say the teen's criticism is well-founded.
They say "American Government" by conservatives James Wilson and John Dilulio presents a skewed view of topics from global warming to separation of church and state.
The publisher now says it will review the book, as will the College Board, which oversees college-level Advanced Placement courses used in high schools.
"Science doesn't know whether we are experiencing a dangerous level of global warming or how bad the greenhouse effect is, if it exists at all.
"
"The earth has become warmer, but is this mostly the result of natural climate changes, or is it heavily influenced by humans putting greenhouse gases into the air?
"
Some wording that LaClair highlighted from the 2005 textbook used in his class was toned down in a more recent edition.
For example, "Science doesn't know whether we are experiencing a dangerous level of global warming or how bad the greenhouse effect is, if it exists at all," was changed to simply "Science doesn't know how bad the greenhouse effect is.
" Andrew Revkin at Dot Earth parses this:
As we’ve written many times, the climate system’s response to rapidly rising greenhouse gas concentrations remains laden with uncertainty.
A doubling of concentrations from the long-term ceiling of 280 parts per million for carbon dioxide before the industrial revolution would most likely raise global temperatures 3.6 to 8.1 degrees Fahrenheit, by the latest I.P.C.C.
analysis. So in that legalistic sense, it’s true that science hasn’t defined “how bad” climate change will be.
And that's about the best you can say of these passages, as Revkin , Hansen , McCracken and the Center for Inquiry all make clear in their point-by-point critiques.
A response from Houghton Mifflin posted by Revkin falls well short of addressing the problem: the book's authors are describing a climate debate that sounds almost nothing like the IPCC 's painstakingly agreed reports.
Instead, as Hansen wrote , "these statements are aimed at giving students the mistaken impression that the scientific evidence of global warming is doubtful and uncertain" - a strategy that's familiar to Hansen.
The BBC is facing allegations that it altered a news story about climate at the behest of an activist.
A series of emails from BBC reporter Roger Harrabin and activist Jo Abbess were posted on the Campaign Against Climate Change website on April 4th.
After a series of back and forths Harrabin writes “Have a look in 10 minutes and tell me you are happier.
... We have changed headline and more”.
The original headline - Global Warming ‘dips this year’ – changed to the current Global Temperatures ‘to decrease’.
Needless to say as soon as these emails were noticed they were picked up by unhappy sceptic bloggers ( here , here and here for example).
The BBC told us:
This would mean global temperatures have not risen since 1998, prompting some to question climate change theory.
But this year's temperatures would still be way above the average - and we would soon exceed the record year of 1998 because of global warming induced by greenhouse gases.
Declan Butler has a feature (subscription required) in this week's Nature on the potential of green architecture for mitigating climate change.
On his blog , he writes:
In Bangkok last week, the first UN climate meeting since Bali wrapped up after struggling til after midnight Friday - not to hammer out emissions targets or controversial new approaches to climate change mitigation, but just to agree on how long to wait before restarting discussions of such matters.
“The talks managed to keep the momentum going … but it’s hard to leave Bangkok confident that the deadline can be met,” said Elliot Diringer, director of international strategies at the Pew Center on Climate Change.
Marcelo Furtado of Greenpeace Brazil agreed , "If we took all these hours to agree on a workplan, one can only imagine what will happen when the real negotiations take place.
"
Why so slow?
For one thing, the G77 group of developing nations finally dug in their heels against Japan's week-long steady pressure to plan greenhouse gas limits for particular global industrial sectors, in addition to Kyoto-style national targets.
Sectoral approaches - heralded recently in Nature Reports Climate Change via this commentary by Glen Peters and Edgar Hertwich and this book review by Gwyn Prins - have the advantage of directly pushing the dirtiest industries to clean up, without leaving less carbon-stringent havens overseas for them to be pushed into.
They also distribute mitigation responsibilities to the developing as well as the developed world, something which the US has previously insisted on but which developing countries have warned they cannot afford without more help from the rich North.
By Friday, Japan met surprisingly fierce opposition to holding a workshop on sectoral approaches at the next climate conference, to be held in Bonn, Germany, in June.
G77 countries, including China , had been pointing to promises from Bali that rich countries would set new national targets and provide mitigation and adaptation funds enabling the South to share the burden of industrial emissions cuts.
After wrangling at length , they compromised on a sectoral workshop in August.
That’s one of the topics under discussion in this month’s issue of Nature Geoscience (subscription) which features a pair of Commentaries, one by Gavin Schmidt of NASA GISS and one by Myles Allen of the University of Oxford , giving their respective opinions on whether blogging is a worthwhile means of communicating science, and specifically climate change.
Today Australia sees the opening of the world's largest trial carbon storage plant ( Sydney Morning Herald , BBC , Reuters ), the construction of which was covered by Hannah Hoag in Nature Reports Climate Change last year.
Since then, soaring costs have prompted the US to junk plans for its FutureGen clean coal power plant, and the down-under demo project is the most massive noncommercial carbon burial site to make it off the drawing board (this Nature News feature rounds up the other contenders as of 2006; subscription required).
For background on how natural rock formations are being used to trap carbon dioxide - and why environmentalists have called the plant a waste of time and money - check out Hannah's report .

The Great Plains of the United States, late twenty-first century: breadbasket or dust bowl?
It may depend on groundwater storage, finds a study published in Nature Geoscience this week (subscription required).
The results are based on an unusually sophisticated watershed model that connects the below-ground water sources, surface water and the land surface itself.
If carbon dioxide is trump, then methane is the joker in the greenhouse game.
The flammable gas (CH4) is produced in wetlands, landfills and in the guts of cattle and sheep, and it is stored in vast amounts in so-called clathrates, or gas hydrates, in the ocean floor.
But not only in matters climate change there’s a danger of confusing people by media coverage that alternates between alarmism and appeasement.
Andrew Revkin of the New York Times has appositely termed the effect a journalistic whiplash for the public.
Mark Lynas , whose Six Degrees (Amazon UK | US ) has been a great success, had a piece in the New Statesman last week about nuclear power.
It was a pretty standard, pretty well executed I'm-a-green-who's-much-more-freaked-out-about-climate-than-about-nukes piece, much in the long travelled Lovelock vein, not that unlike some things George Monbiot has recently been writing .
As such it obviously got up the noses of some greens .
I thought it was pretty sensible, myself; but there's a depressing kicker.
I wrote here yesterday that ‘I don’t think that anyone knows for sure how close we are to reaching tipping points in the climate system’.
As it so happens, a pair of articles published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences this week illustrates this point nicely.
The first is a Perspective by atmospheric scientist V Ramanathan and postdoctoral researcher Yan Feng from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, who argue that the Earth is now committed to a 2.4°C rise in temperature above pre-industrial levels.
Anything above a 2°C increase is generally considered to be ‘dangerous’ climate change and would likely trigger several of the Earth’s tipping points, such as the complete loss of Arctic summer sea ice and melting of the Greenland ice sheet.
And according to the IPCC, a rise in global temperature by 1-3°C will commit the planet to widespread loss of biodiversity, widespread deglaciation of the Greenland Ice Sheet, and a major reduction of area and volume of Hindu-Kush-Himalaya-Tibetan glaciers, which provide the head-waters for most major river systems of Asia.
The authors argue that for atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations to remain constant at 2005 levels for the rest of the century, aggressive emissions reductions would be required – yet emissions are rising .
Currently, the warming effect of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is being masked by the cooling effect of other air pollutants – such as smoke from cooking and agricultural waste burning – that create a dimming effect at the Earth’s surface.
Assuming policies to reduce these air pollutants are successful, the full warming potential of greenhouse gases will soon be realized.
So as air pollution measures become effective (and much headway is being made here), the need for reducing carbon dioxide emissions becomes even more urgent, say Ramanathan and Feng.
Most striking is that, despite years of effort, carbon dioxide emissions are increasing at an alarming rate of 3.5% a year– faster than the 2.7% predicted by the IPCC in their worst case scenario, and miles ahead of the 0.9% annual rise in the 1990s.
Worst still, current measures have been based on a middle-ground IPCC scenario.
Pep Candell from the Global Carbon Budget told me that this was “astonishing”.
The other thing to note is that China and India are galumphing their way up the table of biggest carbon dioxide emitters.
Ten years ago the top four were: USA, China, Russia, Japan.
Today that list reads: China, USA, Russia, India – and I am assured by Candell that next year India will have jumped into third place.
This is a worry – when the Kyoto Protocol was first talked about, the countries of the
China has, since 2002, jumped from being responsible for 14% of the global carbon dioxide emissions, to 21%.
At the same time the US has been hovering at around 20%.
Slightly good news is that our natural saviours - the oceans, forests and soil, are still doing a sterling job.
In 1959, natural sinks removed just over 50% of the carbon dioxide man emitted.
And today, they do the same - gobble up just over half.
The efficiency of these natural sinks has dropped by about 5% in the intervening years, which isn't ideal, but means that the overall news is not disastrous.
Response to the news – which will be officially announced tomorrow – from the media is widespread.
It’s a ‘reality check’ according to the Daily Green ; Zee News runs with the rise of India in the emission charts; while other reports tell it like it is: carbon dioxide emissions still rising .
A little something for those who find the escalating financial crisis overshadowing the somewhat less imminent threat of climate change.
Check out this new 10-minute animation on climate tipping points by Plane Stupid activist Leo Murray, entitled ‘ Wake up, freak out – then get a grip’ .
It may be animation, but light entertainment it isn’t.
Imaginatively illustrated and extensively referenced, this short piece by Murray, who narrates the story as an animated stick figure, takes us through a worst-case scenario of future climate change – from mass species extinctions all the way to famine and war.
I particularly like his representation of positive feedback loops as cogs in a machine.
The science is solid for the most part, but selective - six degrees of warming is an upper estimate after all, and in truth I don’t think that anyone knows for sure how close we are to reaching tipping points in the climate system .
I’m also unconvinced that beyond 6 degrees of warming the Earth will become the domain of flies, cockroaches and rats – isn’t that more of a nuclear winter scenario?
But Murray’s animation does a great job of bringing to life the concept of catastrophic climate change, with a defiant take home message to boot:
It is now very clear that in order to actually win the fight against climate change, making big changes to the way we each live our own lives is not going to be enough; we’re also going to have to actively confront powerful vested interests who will stop at nothing to prevent the changes we need from taking place.
We have to be more than just consumers.
This week on Nature Reports Climate Change, we have a series of news features on the US elections, looking at where the presidential candidates stand on energy and climate.
We submitted questions to both campaigns on the key issues - such as whether the US should accept international binding targets before China and India to how they would balance tapping domestic oil reserves with reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
Reporter Amanda Leigh Haag also takes also looks at how the presidential candidates – and their running mates – have fared on climate and energy policy to date, and on the challenges that the newly inaugurated president will likely face in pushing legislation through Congress .
What is clear is that whoever wins the White House will face a daunting list of challenges in making climate change a priority on both the home front, and internationally.
Not least of these will be the short lead in time to negotiating a successor to the Kyoto Protocol, while facing pressure to push federal legislation through Congress.
The report (which I've not yet scanned: here's a note from Roger at Prometheus ) says that to make this happen will take about €10bn in subsidies.
Hey, I thought -- that's about 2% of the proposed banking bail-out (and over a fair bit of time, too).
If we can afford to bail out the banks -- probably a good idea, if it's done properly -- surely we can afford to make a few investments like this to get us the tools for dealing with the carbon/climate crisis.
I had the good fortune this week to take part in some very interesting – and inspiring – initiatives aimed at communicating climate change by merging science with the arts.
As someone who spends most waking hours thinking about climate change in a rational way, I found it refreshing – and fun - to come at it from a completely different angle.
We had ‘show and tell’ workshops where we discussed objects relating to climate change that hold special personal significance, and ‘coaching’ sessions to think about how our own actions might make a difference.
Participants became innovative in the use of improv objects – from eggs to suitcases – in putting together 2-minute productions on climate change.
The Oxford workshop is just one event hosted by TippingPoint , which aims to ‘harness the power of the imagination to help stabilise the climate’ and was originally founded by Diana Liverman, director of Oxford University's Environmental Change Institute with artist David Buckland and its current executive director Peter Gringold.
Criminal damage in the name of climate change is not a criminal offence, according to a shock ruling from a British court.
A jury yesterday acquitted six Greenpeace activists who claimed that the threat of global warming was a ‘lawful excuse’ for the damage they caused while protesting at a coal power plant (see this blog post for background).
Climate change scientist James Hansen had previously backed the six: he released a statement declaring “We will need our Mercedes-driving lawyer friends to tell us if the verdict has greater significance -- but the jurors were common people, not politicians.
“The main point, that the government, the utility, and the fossil fuel industry, were aware of the facts [of climate change] but continued to ignore them are more generally valid worldwide.
It raises the question of whether the right people are on trial.”
Although timidly questioned every so often, this apparently wrong postulate has prevailed for more than 30 years, leaving its mark in the Kyoto Protocol which excludes old-growth forests from national carbon budgets.
“Hence, 15 % of the global forest surface, which is currently not being considered for offsetting increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations, is responsible for at least 10% of the global net ecosystem production,” the authors write.
Obviously, the carbon sequestered in old forest was previously accounted for elsewhere.
Disturbingly, given that some offset profiteers praise tree planting as a panacea of sorts for climate change, young forests may actually be sources, rather than sinks, of CO2, if decomposition of soils and older vegetation preceded their creation.
Leaving intact and protecting old forests seems a far better option.
This insight comes rather late, but better late than never.
Oh, and it will really give climate negotiators something to think about.
Check out my story today on NRCC for details on the IPCC elections held last week.
News in brief: Rajendra Pachauri is chairman again - he had no contenstants for the chief job on the next assessment report, having overseen the UN climate panel's transformation to Nobel-winning semi-household name last year.
But new co-chairs will lead the three working groups, and their elections had a novel feature: voting.
Last week NASA climatologist Jim Hansen came to London to testify on behalf of activists who defaced the Kingnorth coal-fired power station in Kent, which we recently blogged about here on Climate Feedback.
Nature reporter Geoff Brumfiel caught up with Hansen in a London hotel to find out what has got him all hot and bothered.
You can read the full story over on Nature News.
There are plenty of ideas these days for purposefully messing with large-scale Earth systems in the hope of offsetting global warming.
The Phil Trans A articles don't catalogue them, though Stephen Schneider of Stanford touches on many in a great review article .
A pair of papers by the University of Edinburgh's Stephen Salter, NCAR's John Latham, and their colleagues discuss spraying micron-wide particles of sea water into the air to make clouds whiter so that they reflect more light.
Ocean fertilization is defended against 20 years of outcry by Victor Smetacek of the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research and Wajih Naqvi of the Indian National Institute of Oceanography.

As residents of New Orleans prepare to return home and breathe a sigh of relief that Hurricane Gustav was less damaging than feared, new research published today in Nature [subscription] suggests that the strongest tropical cyclones will pick up speed in the coming decades.
Weighing in on the long-running and at times very stormy debate over whether and how warmer seas will affect the intensity and frequency of hurricanes is a team led by climatologist James Elsner of Florida State University.
Using a 25-year archive of satellite data, Elsner and colleagues derive wind speeds for tropical cyclones over the globe.
They find that the maximum wind speeds reached by the strongest tropical cyclones increased from 1981-2006 in most ocean basins, with the greatest changes in the North Atlantic and Northern Indian Oceans.
There was no trend in the intensity of cyclones occuring over the South Pacific, however, and the upward trend observed over a couple of ocean regions was not statistically significant.
The researchers also found no increase in either the frequency or average intensity of tropical cyclones over the globe.
The approach taken by Elsner and colleagues – looking at whether the most severe cyclones will hit a higher speed limit during their lifetime – is both novel and socially relevant, simply because the most severe storms do the most damage if they make landfall.
Once tropical cyclones reach speeds of over 74mph, they are officially classified as hurricanes.
The real bone of contention within the scientific community has been whether hurricanes will become more intense and more frequent as a result of human-induced climate change.
Elsner and colleagues steer well clear of linking the trend to global warming though - they can’t attribute cause as their study doesn’t investigate other factors such as cyclone origin and duration, proximity to land, El Niño conditions and solar activity.
At the IPCC’s twentieth birthday party Sunday, UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon urged the diplomats present to get moving - now - on the post-Kyoto climate treaty.
"We must fight the urge to postpone everything until Copenhagen,” where the treaty is to be finalized in 2009, he said .
“Surely we can make concrete progress on some issues.
"
How much progress?
The glass-half-full view is that the latest talks, wrapping up in Accra, Ghana, last week, already took some modest but visible steps forward - particularly on reducing emissions from deforestation and heavy industry.
On the other hand, the major climate conference in Poznan, Poland, this December happens while President Bush is still in office, meaning that any change in the US stance is on hold until 2009.
To mark the IPCC’s anniversary, NRCC debuted a timeline of the international policy debates that first gave birth to the IPCC, and then were shaped by its findings.
In sifting through accounts of past climate negotiations while working on the timeline, I was struck by the invariable tales of gruesome battles into the wee hours.
The classic was Kyoto in 1997, as reported by the Washington Post :
The contentious ‘hockey stick’ climate change graph has again been upheld as broadly accurate, doubtless to the rage of climate denialists/sceptics/whatevers.
Whether it’s the US agreeing to greenhouse gas emissions targets, passing federal cap-and-trade legislation or allowing climate scientists to speak out about their work, the accepted wisdom has been that such things will come about once George W is replaced as president.
How either candidate would, once in office, balance the need for energy security and independence with sharp reductions in greenhouse gases remains to be seen.
But at the very least both Obama and McCain recognise the role of human activity in climate change, and the need to do something about it.
Palin, on the other hand, apparently doesn’t, as has been widely reported on the blogosphere.
Check out the coverage over on Salon , Climate Progress , and on the Christian Science Monitor’s blog , which reports the following:
“With the choice of Gov.
Palin, it’s the third term of Dick Cheney,” he said.
“He’s chosen somebody who doesn’t believe climate change is man-made.”
Her position contrasts with official GOP line on climate change, so it’s hard to know what comprises would be made on this issue if the pair get elected.
But the fact that McCain has chosen Palin as a running mate has left some questioning his commitment to tackling climate change .
In the meantime, Obama has responded to a 14-part questionnaire from Science Debate 2008 on how he would address some big issues in science, while McCain has yet to respond.

This week on Nature Reports Climate Change, we have a news feature on a topic that has been considered something of a conservation taboo: assisted migration – in other words manually relocating species that are under threat of extinction from climate change.
But with climate change impacting biological systems throughout the globe, the reality is that many species may have to adapt to climate change in situ or say sayonara as part of the Earth’s sixth mass extinction.
And for those that could up and leave to a better place if they were not hemmed in by human barriers, giving them a helping hand could make all the difference.
Arctic permafrost has been the subject of much global warming worry, but not so much detailed research.
A new survey of North American Arctic permafrost published in Nature Geoscience this week (subscription required) breaks new ground, literally.
News accounts have focused on the paper’s bottom-line estimate: there is 60% more carbon frozen up there than previously thought.
That’s a total of 98.2 billion tonnes of carbon, one-sixth of the amount currently circulating through the atmosphere.
Existing estimates already show more permafrost carbon around the globe than atmospheric carbon.
If warming - which is happening faster in the Arctic than anywhere else - releases even a small portion of that store into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide and methane, the results won’t be pretty, especially if the amount frozen in the Asian north is also more than expected.
Permafrost has been called a “ slow-motion time bomb ”, and the effects of its melting are not included in most global climate models.
The US Climate Change Science Program will revise and reissue its latest report following widespread criticism and a mountain of comments during the official review period.
The news has spurred talk of sinister motives from groups like the conservative Competitive Enterprise Institute , as well as some media attention ( Greenwire , subscription required) suggesting undue influence from global warming skeptics.
Agencies within the climate science program have been putting out climate reports on various topics for the past year or so (10 down, 11 to go).
The document in question, which is being ushered through the process by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, was released last month for public comment and is a synthesis report that is supposed to tie everything together.
That has some wondering: How can the summary document be completed before the documents it is supposed to be summarizing?
Fair question, although in defence the document is a high-level review of the entire body of global warming science, and most of the reports are fairly far along anyway.
But still.
And a while back University of Colorado climate policy expert Roger Pielke Jr. took a few shots at the document on his blog , questioning general content and accusing the authors of sloppiness.
Folks at WWF as well as Michael MacCracken at the Climate Institute in Washington, say problems with the actual document are typical of first drafts and easily resolvable.
An official within the Climate Change Science Program confirmed that the document will be revised to deal with the sheer volume of comments and re-released.
No time frame was given.
Former Time magazine reporter Eric Roston chronicles the story of carbon and its significance in the wider universe in his first book ‘The Age of Carbon’, which Mark Lynas reviews over on Nature Reports Climate Change.
I’m all for a website that distills climate science papers into something easily understood by the general public, especially if it avoids the hype and hysteria all too often employed by headline news.
Such is the claim of CO2 Science , a weekly newsletter published by the not for profit Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change, with issues that include editorials, book and media reviews, and mini-reviews of the recent peer-reviewed literature.
But rather than its promise of “separating reality from rhetoric in the emotionally-charged debate that swirls around the subject of carbon dioxide and global change”, on the contrary CO2 Science twists the most recent science, ever so subtly, to suggest that there is no link between carbon dioxide levels and climate change.
For a case in point, check out the feature entitled “ Medieval Warm Period Record of the Week ”.
This showcases records of temperature or environmental changes during the Medieval Warm Period (aka the Medieval Climate Anomaly).
The conclusion is that if the MWP was warmer than present – still debated – obviously CO2 isn’t driving current warming.
There is even a list of 576 scientists who have found evidence for the MWP – the thinly veiled conclusion being that they agree that an increase in CO2 isn’t behind the recent climate change.
FYI scientists – if you’ve ever compiled a climate record for the past 2,000 years, your name is probably there.
These folks are thorough.
I was lucky enough to spend last weekend at t his year's SciFoo , and took in a number of sessions on climate and energy.
There was a lot of sometimes quite heated debate, but what was struck me most forcefully was the common ground that the optimists and pessimists share -- specifically, a belief that the challenge in front of us is utterly huge.
I almost said mind-numbingly huge, but people like Dan Schrag and Saul Griffith and Chris Uhlik have minds too active and well-exercised to numb easily...
In this week’s issue of Nature, we look into an ongoing debate about research priorities within the National Center for Atmospheric Research, one of the United States’ main climate research facilities in Boulder, Colorado.
Meanwhile, other NCAR scientists who have worked in the social science program say they are comfortable with their positions.
And some are worried that NCAR is falling behind on its basic sciences and climate modelling.
Is this not the foundation for such a scientific institution?

Not your average silly season read, the August issue takes as its theme the Stern review on the economics of climate change and features a series of invited editorial essays on the topic.
Published in 2006, the Stern Review is a whopping 700-page dossier written by former World Bank economist Sir Nicholas Stern for the UK government.
In economic terms, its chief message is that taking strong, early action on climate change outweighs the costs of doing nothing, or delaying action.
Stern’s analysis showed that by reducing greenhouse gas emissions now, we could limit the cost to as little as around 1% of global GDP (through carbon taxes or emissions trading), whereas unabated climate change could cost the world at least 5% of GDP each year or, in worst-case scenarios, more than 20% of GDP.
Hailed as a landmark report for successfully framing climate change in monetary terms, the review has also received much criticism – chiefly from economists who question the validity of Stern's approach even if they believe ‘Stern is right for the wrong reasons’, as Gary Yohe and Richard Tol highlight in their essay .
Protests at the climate camp in Kingsnorth, Kent, the site of a proposed new coal fired power plant, reached a climax this weekend, as reported by various news sources .
Demonstrators, who promised to reach the site by air, land and sea, reached about 3,000 in number during the course of the week, but – met by some 1,500 police officers - failed to halt business at the site’s existing plant.
The main question is whether the UK government, which has argued for tough international regulations on climate change, will allow the power plant to go ahead without carbon capture and storage (CCS).
UK energy minister Malcolm Wicks argues that new coal fired power plants such as the one being proposed in Kent are needed to demonstrate the feasibility of CCS technology, which remains unproven.
This may be true, but if demonstrating CCS really is the priority, then why is it that there is no obligation for the owners of Kingsnorth to use CCS, should it be proven?
In the latest issue of Nature Reports Climate Change , I've written an editorial on how coal-fired power capacity is expanding rapidly, yet the rate of development of carbon sequestration to bury the emissions is laging far behind.
I got a kick out of this story, having read Gavin Schmidt and Elisabeth Moyer’s NRCC op-ed last week on the chilly gap between paleoclimatologists and climate modellers (and the perhaps-even-chillier one between climate scientists and economists).
Schmidt and Moyer point out that while the paleo crowd may “assume that modellers have a myopic view of climate history”, modellers “may assume that palaeo-science is too anecdotal, qualitative and localized to be of use for quantitative modelling.”
Per that headline, however, paleo researchers occasionally make delightfully precise statements - when they get their hands on a sample that yields data at the right timescale.
But even then, connecting snapshots of the past with future climate scenarios is not straightforward.

Their proposed scheme involves placing vertical pipes some 200 meters long in the sea to pump nutrient-rich water from depth to the surface, thus enhancing the growth of algae in the upper ocean.
The algae, which are key in transporting carbon dioxide to the deep sea and producing dimethyl sulphide involved in the formation of sunlight-reflecting clouds, should help to prevent further warming.
Lovelock and Rapley admit that the scheme may fail or impact the ocean in negative ways, such as through further acidification (which is recognized a significant threat to marine life and water quality ) but they argue that the stakes are so high now that we can’t afford not to try such a solution.
This week on Nature Reports Climate Change , Amanda Leigh Haag looks at how climate change is increasingly becoming an issue of national security, raising the alarm on issues of border control and immigration policy globally.
The feature details how regions likely to bear the brunt of climate impacts are already beginning to look to neighbouring states for potential resettlement deals, while less vulnerable nations are considering the likely spillover of large-scale migration from areas impacted by severe drought or flooding.
Last week Kevin Trenberth offered a perspective on Nature Climate Feedback where he suggested that "clarity is actually emerging" in the scientific community on the relationship of greenhouse gas emissions and hurricane activity.
My perspective on this debate differs from Kevin's: Those in the tropical cyclone research community with different views on this subject remain as far apart as ever, and a community consensus beyond that presented in last year's WMO report has yet to emerge.
1) The recent Holland (2007) paper in EOS dipped back into the same North Atlantic dataset that is the subject of intense debate to find that the area where storms have formed appears to have changed over time, observing that the dataset shows "the eastward spread of cyclone developments into the equatorial Atlantic.
" Of course, those who argue that changes in observational systems are responsible for the increase in storm frequency found in the dataset can equally apply this logic to the location where storms are first observed.
That is, they would argue that as observations have improved, more storms have been observed to have formed in the eastern Atlantic.
Holland's paper therefore provides ample support for both sides of the debate, which is not surprising since its analysis depends upon the exact same dataset that has been contested.
Whether or not landfall rates are a constant proportion of basin activity remains a scientific frontier in hurricane climatology.
2) What has been neglected in the debate - by both sides - and is implicit in Holland (2007) is that whatever the cause of increased activity in the North Atlantic, the increase has taken place in the eastern Atlantic far from where landfalls occur (and this holds for storm counts and measures of intensity).
On this point everyone seems to agree (see this exchange between ClimateAudit's Steve McIntyre, who pointed out this trend on his blog and Georgia Tech's Judy Curry, who is a collaborator with Holland).
What this means is that if global warming has indeed led to an increase in North Atlantic hurricane activity, then it has necessarily (and ironically) had the effect of making the United States relatively safer from hurricanes as the proportion of total storms that makes landfall has decreased dramatically .
(That is, landfalls show no trend while basin activity has increased due to global warming according to Mann et al.
2007 cited by Kevin).
Imagine that headline - "Global Warming Protects U.S.from Increasing Landfalls"!
Strange but true, but that is exactly the right message to take if Holland (2007) is taken at face value.
The recent Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit has brought further attention to climate change and what, if anything, to do about it.
In spite of the IPCC findings that global warming is “unequivocal”, doubt remains in some quarters about the reality of climate change and the human cause.
Issues are continually raised that have no basis, as highlighted by the recent Commentary from Syun-Ichi Akasofu in the Wall Street Journal .
Akasofu immediately starts out on the wrong foot by claiming there are two sides, those of believers and non-believers, but it is not a matter of belief, it is a matter of scientific facts!
He further fails to understand the nature of the IPCC process and the extensive reviews in which all comments are addressed rigorously as the report is developed over three years.
Contrary to the claim, there is no assumption by IPCC that recent warming was due to the increased greenhouse effect from increasing human produced carbon dioxide.
Rather, climate models that run with and without the human-induced changes in atmospheric composition demonstrate that human warming has emerged from natural climate variability since about 1970.
Over the past 500,000 years or so, temperatures, carbon dioxide and methane have gone up and down more or less in tandem through the major ice ages and interglacial periods, as shown in ice cores.
As detailed in a Real Climate blog post on this topic , in the absence of human intervention, these changes happen over time, but not at the rate at which CO2 is currently increasing in the atmosphere.
Scientists know that carbon dioxide and methane changes follow rather than cause these changes in temperature between glacial periods, but they also know that these changes in greenhouse gases amplify a relatively weak forcing to help drive temperature change.
To suggest otherwise, as Akasofu does, is misleading at best.
He further claims that natural climate variations have been forgotten and attributes recent warming to the “rebounding effect from the little ice age”, but fails to realize that natural climate variability also has a cause.
While it is true that we do not have the measurements to show what was happening in the ocean during this time, for instance, we have good reason to believe that natural internal variability played a role.
To the extent that the "Little Ice Age" and "Medieval Warm Period" can be meaningfully defined, there has been much work showing that the main variations can be explained in terms of the response of the climate system to natural variability in solar and volcanic events that would have influenced surface temperature.
And warm periods in the past, such as the warming in the Greenland region in the mid-twentieth century, were not global in contrast to recent warming, which is.
Climate models are not perfect, but they are useful tools for quantifying the effects of various climate processes and drivers of climate change.
Akasofu decries the confused state of climatology, but it is he who is really confused, and his article only serves to confuse the general public.
It is sad that a once distinguished newspaper published such misleading half-truths without verifying them.
The situation on how hurricanes have changed and will likely change in the future are outlined in my recent Scientific American article, but may seem as murky as ever to the public although clarity is actually emerging.
A recent news report in the Press Register outlines some sources of confusion related to just how well the past record is known.
It cites work by Landsea that relied on numbers of land-falling storms as a way to calibrate the Atlantic hurricane record, and which concluded that there may be an undercount of 3.2 storms per year prior to 1966.
The most recent Eos Transactions has two articles that follow up and point out why use of land-falling storms is misleading [ Holland 2007; Eos 88 (36) 348-349 ] and that the conclusions of increased activity do not change anyway [ Mann et al., 2007; Eos 88 (36) 349-350 ].
The Holland article points out that there are good reasons why the fraction of storms making landfall should change, both because of natural variations and especially if the climate changes.
The Mann et al.
article adopts the Landsea-suggested changes for the past as a “what if” test and goes on to show that even a substantial underestimate of early 20th century storms does not change the significance of the increase in activity since 1994.
Nor does it change the strong relationship with observed sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the region; the SSTs have a much more reliable observational record and have clearly increased.
Surprisingly, none of these studies refers to what seems to me to be the most definitive analysis of the likely missed storms in the historical counts by Chang and Guo (2007) in which they analyze in detail the actual ship tracks in the past compared with modern tropical storm tracks.
To quote their main conclusions: “It is estimated that the number of tropical cyclones not making landfall over any continent or the Caribbean may have been underestimated by up to 2.1 per year during 1904–1913, with this number decreasing to 1.0 per year or less during the 1920s and later decades.
Our results suggest that the characteristics of North Atlantic tropical cyclone track statistics might have changed during the 20th century.”
In 2007 the tropical storm season has been fairly normal in many respects up to now.
Only 3 hurricanes have been recorded (versus average 3 to 4) but two were category 5 storms, and that is highly unusual.
Forecasts of hurricane activity by NOAA and Bill Gray continue to forecast substantially above normal activity in the Atlantic.
To me, observing the events thus far, the incredibly intense convective activity in the Indian Ocean from May to July was an important and totally overlooked factor.
The subsequent heavy rains and flooding in India and China were no doubt related.
The fact that Atlantic hurricane activity is influenced by events in the Indian Ocean seems to be overlooked by the hurricane forecasters.
On Friday, the US Geological Survey put out a press release about its new findings on polar bears and their future, and the press responded en masse: Google offers hundreds of stories filed over the weekend.
The reports’ conclusion ( AP | New York Times ) is that diminishing sea ice is a serious problem for the bears, with two thirds of them at risk over the next fifty years – maybe more if, as the report recognises, current estimates of ice loss are too conservative.
Most quoted quote: "As the sea ice goes, so goes the polar bear" -- Steven Amstrup, the lead author of the new studies .
Some bear populations, such as those of Alaska, are expected to die out completely, which is naturally enough the lead in the Anchorage Daily News .
If you’re a polar bear, the place you want to be is what the USGS calls the “convergent ice ecoregion” (a term that doesn’t seem to turn up in the news); this is where the currents pile up ice that can persist for years on the northern shores of the Canadian islands and down the eastern side of Greenland.
You don’t want to be west of Greenland or in Baffin Bay, where the ice is seasonal ice and likely to vanish, or on the north shores of Russia and Alaska, where the currents move what ice there is away from the shore (the “divergent ice ecoregion”).
The reports are part of the process by which the US government will decide whether to put polar bears on the endangered species list ( earlier Nature story ).
Geoffrey Lean , at the Independent, pulls the USGS report together with his paper’s investigation into polar bear hunting , which is apparently on the increase.
Lean and others also bring up a meeting of religious, scientific and political leaders that’s been going on in Ilulissat , where “leaders of Christian, Shia, Sunni, Hindu, Shinto, Buddhist and Jewish religions took a boat to the tongue of the glacier for a silent prayer for the planet” while Robert Correll, chairman of the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, warned of “a massive acceleration of the speed with which these glaciers are moving into the sea,” according to Paul Brown in the Guardian .
Meanwhile, almost all of the stories also mention the current reduced area of Arctic sea ice, which this year has already reached a record low and is expected to keep shrinking for a week or so more.
The US National Snow and Ice Data Center is keeping a close eye on the situation with regular updates and a lot of interesting data, not to mention a really nice animation that shows how the ice cover evolves over many years (found via and easily seen at Steinn Sigurdsson's Dynamics of Cats ) which explains more about the convergent and divergent ecoregions than a static map ever could.
The BBC, it seems, is damned if it does and damned if it don’t.
Having abandoned plans for a day long global warming special “which would have involved viewers in a mass ‘switch-off’ to save energy” it has taken fire from all sides ( BBC News ).
As its own reporting notes it has been accused of “cowardice” by environmentalists.
However, critics including some senior voices within the corporation had previously slammed the planned ‘Planet Relief’ programme as a violation of the commitment to impartiality enshrined in the BBC’s charter.
The BBC claims the show was scrapped not due to impartiality concerns but because audiences “are most receptive to documentary or factual-style programming as a means of learning about the issues surrounding this subject”.
So maybe they’ll just be showing ‘An Inconvenient Truth’ on loop?
For those not based in the UK it is probably worth noting that the BBC is funded by a ‘licence fee’ levied on every television owner.
It is “forbidden from expressing an opinion on current affairs or matters of public policy other than broadcasting” ( BBC guidelines ).
The scrapping of the show follows heated debate within the BBC over its stance on climate change.
One of the BBC’s own editors earlier this month said it was "not the corporation's job to save the planet" ( Daily Mail ).
The blogosphere has gone into pretty predictable overdrive .
Another employee, the BBC’s Head of News Peter Horrocks, wrote a blog entry on the topic in which he said “It is not the BBC's job to lead opinion or proselytise on this or any other subject.” However Horrocks also says “there is an increasingly strong (although not overwhelming) weight of scientific opinion in favour of the proposition that climate change is happening and is being largely caused by man”.
I’m not sure many climate scientists would agree that the weight of opinion was “not overwhelming”.
Opposition politician Chris Huhne, environment spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, certainly wouldn’t.
“The consensus about global warming in the science community is now overwhelming,” he says ( Independent ), “so accusing the BBC of campaigning on such an undisputed threat is like suggesting it should be even-handed between criminals and their victims.”
Having been off the airwaves for a while, I’m back with some further musings on climate change surveys, which (unwittingly) seems to be becoming a bit of a pet topic of mine.
Then comes the survey on consumers’ attitudes to sustainable living .
Conducted by think tank The Future Laboratory , the results are based on a multiple choice questionnaire issued to 1,000 people in 12 UK counties this autumn.
The main finding is that ‘green is the new norm’ and that environmental issues are galvanizing 'a new breed of citizen’ in the UK committed to living a sustainable lifestyle.
It’s great to have individuals feeling friendly about the environment and about its future, but as is the case with so many of these surveys, the questions tend to polarize opinion and naturally frame opinion within the context of predefined questions.
In relation to climate change, for example, 41% of respondents said individual action was the only way forward in solving the problem.
I’d like to know what the alternatives were, but strangely there wasn’t a question relating to climate in the questionnaire, so that one remains a mystery.
Hurricane Felix, currently menacing Central America, has become the second storm of 2007 to be rated category five – the highest wind speed category ( updates ).
The Daily Telegraph says it was upgraded on Sunday from category two to category five in 15 hours – one of the fasted jumps on record.
There is some debate over what this might mean.
Jean-Noel Degrace, expert at Meteo-France told the AFP , “The fact that there have already been two intense storms marks out 2007 as an active year.” Mark Saunders, lead scientist with the Tropical Storm Risk, only went so far as to say it was “unusual but not unprecedented” to have a category five at this point in the hurricane season.
Despite the US National Hurricane Center having already predicted this to be an “above-normal” hurricane season, some people are still getting excited, perhaps over excited.
“I can't get over these numbers: The 1980s saw three official Category 5 hurricanes.
The 1990s saw two.
The 2000s, so far, have seen eight, all clustered from 2003 to 2007.
In this context, the past five years certainly look like a scary anomaly compared to what has come before,” said blogger Chris Mooney , whose book “Storm World” deals with “Hurricanes, politics and the battle over global warming ( Nature review , subscribers only).
Could these hurricane numbers be linked to global warming?
Climate modeller William M. Connolley is having less than none of it .
“If you want to know if its got warmer, then hurricanes are clearly a poor indicator - the record is too noisy,” he says.
“And we have a far better record: that of the temperature.
If you want to know, conversely, if GW is going to lead to more or deeper or scarier hurricanes, then counting numbers by decade isn't a good idea either.” Their disagreement continues in the comments of Connolley’s blog.
Whatever the truth of the situation, it is proving grist to the mill of those looking for a liberal (for which read global warming expounding, environmentalist) bias in the media – NewsBusters for example.
Mooney has also pulled together a nice set of links on Felix .

On the BBC Today program this morning the head of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Yvo de Boer
The UN's binding global climate agreement, the Kyoto Protocol, currently requires industrialised nations to reduce the majority of emissions themselves.
3.
Given the long residence time of atmospheric carbon dioxide, concentrations cannot be stabilized if developed countries do not reduce emissions by a great deal.
Everybody’s been reviewing the new book on hurricanes and global warming, and Nature is no exception.
We’ve got not one, but two reviews of Storm World: Hurricanes, Politics and the Battle Over Global Warming.
In Nature proper, James Elsner of Florida State provides the academic’s reading .
He pulled off a nice metaphor for the lead of the review (calling the book ‘a reconnaissance flight into the turbulent debate over a link between hurricane activity and global warming’), which made me a tad envious.
I thought I was being clever with my own lead for a review of the book, which appears online on Nature Reports Climate Change .
Unlike Elsner, I chose to riff off the reputation of the book’s author, Chris Mooney, and his recent work on how scientists can best ‘frame’ their results for the public .
Both reviews, though, will tell you the main point of the book: the battle over hurricanes and climate change, with MIT’s Kerry Emanuel and Colorado State’s Bill Gray taking starring roles as antagonists.
Storm World is a colorful glimpse into this highly publicized corner of tropical meteorology, with scientists trading barbs at conferences and via media appearances.
It’s also a good book to read as hurricane season in several ocean basins nears its peak: at the time of this writing, Hurricane Flossie was bearing down on the Big Island of Hawaii with its category-3 strength winds.
Just when everyone was getting sick of explaining that climate models are producing projections not predictions per se, it seems that some of them are indeed producing predictions.
There's a paper ( pdf ) in Science from a team at the Hadley Center that shows how using real initial conditions improves the accuracy of ten year climate forecasts.
They do a bit for hindcasting first, looking at historical data and comparing model runs with real initial conditions with run-of-the-mill runs.
Then they do some prediction.
This prediction is being treated as saying that we're at the end of a little plateau, and that at the end of this decade things will warm up further, giving a run of years in the early 2010s where the chances for new global records are good.
Quirin Schiermeier wrote a story on this for news@nature , reporting that the modelling community seems pretty impressed.
Here's a bunch more coverage (88 pieces at the time of googling), and for those with a subscription to Science here's the estimable Dick Kerr , who had longer to write the story than the rest of us...
The team, led by Harvard's Ken Feeley, suggests that if this sort of effect were repeated in bigger rainforests (most of which have only experienced marginal warming to date, as I understand it) then what are now stable stores of carbon would become net sources as theworld heats up.
This is obviously a considerably less optimistic scenario than the possibility that carbon-dioxide fertilisation would make them sinks.
It would presumably make the net effect of the increase in soil respiration that Peter Cox and others always stress ( Nature paper from 2000 ) an even worse problem.
In 1996 and 2003 we surveyed the opinions on climate change held by climate scientists.
The results of these surveys have been subject to many misuses and erroneous claims.
Some have selected individual statements out of context (scroll down to number 5) to bolster their claims, while others have argued that the 2003 part of the survey would be strongly biased by skeptics misusing the online-sampling for multiple submissions.
With respect to the latter – the survey was conducted first in 1996 with a mail-out format, which nobody claimed could be biased and the results were published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society .
The second survey from 2003 was conducted on the internet, a procedure that in principle could have been misused by multiple submissions by those skeptical or alarmist on climate change who shared the password.
However, the 2003 results are internally consistent with the 1996 results.
In 2003 scientists expressed increased satisfaction and agreement with the IPCC and increased confidence in the tools of the science.
In comparison to 1996, no anomalies were found in the response to questions.
On the skeptical side, the survey has often been used to create the impression that most scientists were not in support of anthropogenic causes of ongoing climate change: Specifically, it was noted that “For example more climate scientists ‘strongly disagree’ than ‘strongly agree’ that climate change is mostly the result of anthropogenic causes.” This interpretation is certainly biased.
We had requested responses on a scale from 1-7 to the question “Climate change is mostly the result of anthropogenic causes.” – with 1 representing “strong agreement” and 7 “strong disagreement”.
Thus, scales 1-3 signal agreement, 4 an ambivalent position, and 5-7 disagreement.
The frequency distribution for the two surveys in 1996 and 2003 are:

Kudzu vines have become a wide-spread but unwelcome sight throughout much of the southeastern United States.
The noxious weed – native to Asia and once planted to prevent soil erosion – has spread rapidly, smothering native species in its wake.
But the vine may be wreaking atmospheric havoc as well.
In a paper in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , Jonathan Hickman of Stony Brook University and colleagues find that invasion of the vine more than doubles nitric oxide emissions and increases ozone pollution.
The world’s carbon dioxide ‘sinks’ are not able to keep up with the amount of the greenhouse gas being produced, according to a paper published in Nature Geoscience .
Reviewing the recent literature Corinne Le Quéré, of the University of East Anglia, and colleagues report that between 1959 and 2008 43% of each year’s carbon dioxide emissions have remained in the atmosphere with the rest being absorbed by land and ocean sinks.
However in the last 50 years they suggest that the fraction remaining in the atmosphere has increased from about 40% to 45%.
“The Earth’s carbon sinks are complex and there are some gaps in our understanding, particularly in our ability to link human-induced CO2 emissions to atmospheric CO2 concentrations on a year-to-year basis,” says Le Quéré ( press release ).
“But, if we can reduce the uncertainty about the carbon sinks, our data could be used to verify the effectiveness of climate mitigations policies.”
Northern peatlands, typical for subarctic Scandinavia and Russia, contain one third of the world’s soil organic carbon.
How much extra carbon these soils will release to the atmosphere, through accelerated respiration in a warmer climate, has been pretty much guesswork.
Data from an eight-year in situ experiment carried out in Sweden now suggest that even modest warming will release enough extra carbon to effectively equalize the European Union’s emissions reductions achieved under the Kyoto Protocol .
Ellen Dorrepaal and her colleagues studied ecosystem response to climate warming at a test site near the Swedish Abisko scientific research station , some 200 kilometres inside the Arctic Circle.
In a paper in Nature today (subscription required) they report that warming accelerated the respiration of carbon in peat overlaying the permafrost by almost 70 % - much more than previously thought.
Here's an editor's summary .
Extrapolated to the total northern peatland area, the results suggest that climate warming of 1 degree Celsius over the next decade might lead to a global increase in respiration of 38-100 million tonnes of carbon per year.
For comparison: The EU’s Kyoto target is to reduce emissions by 92 million tonnes of carbon per year.
The researchers stress that the effect is likely to last: “In contrast to long-term studies in forest, meadow and tundra ecosystems, the warming effect did not decline towards the eighth year of the study,” they write.
The net effect of warming on northern carbon reservoirs includes possible gains from increased plant growth.
But in Arctic ecosystems dominated by peat and moss, there are too few productive woody shrubs growing to offset the warming effect on soils.
Why carbon dioxide concentrations over the past 24 million years or so have never dropped below 200 parts per million, despite environmental conditions that have been favourable for CO2 drawdown by rock weathering and sedimentation, has always been a bit of a mystery.
Now scientists suggest an almost provocatively simple mechanism that might have kept the planet from cooling more severely than it actually did during past glacial climates: Changes in terrestrial vegetation stopped the weathering-driven decline in atmospheric CO2 concentrations which else would have turned Earth into a lifeless freezer.
Weathering is known to be largely controlled by vegetation.
So the team, led by Mark Pagani of Yale University, describes in a paper in Nature today a negative feedback whereby limited plant growth during cold conditions slows down the rate of weathering and sedimentation, thus preventing carbon dioxide levels from dropping even further.
An editor's summary of the paper is here .
This “bold and provocative” hypothesis provides an “elegant twist” on existing ideas about climate-vegetation interactions, Yves Goddéris and Yannick Donnadieu write in an accompanying News and Views article (subscription required).
But the proposed feedback mechanism raises contentious issues as well.
For example, Goddéris and Donnadieu argue that in the tropics the role of vegetation cover in the climate system might not be as significant as proposed.
There has been quite some controversy over the total size of the Northern Hemisphere’s terrestrial carbon sink, so this first comprehensive estimate, published in Nature today , is filling a real gap.
Given China’s 1.2 billion population and rapidly growing economy, knowledge of how much of its emissions are actually staying in the atmosphere is pretty valuable information.
Globally, around 40% of annual emissions stay in the atmosphere; the rest is sequestered by plants, soils and oceans.
The Chinese data come at a time of growing speculation and guesswork over the People's Republic’s future climate and energy policies.
Needless to say, the study is of no small relevance with a view to upcoming climate negotiations.
The very fact that China’s land carbon sink is large is good news.
But the results will also strengthen the Chinese government’s negotiation position at the United Nations climate summit in December in Copenhagen.
The Earth’s large forests take up substantially more atmospheric carbon dioxide through photosynthesis than they release back to the atmosphere through respiration.
Thus acting as a carbon ‘sink’, they (and the oceans) are our closest natural allies in the fight against climate change.
But many forests are at threat - not only from logging and clearing, but from climate change itself.
Take drought.
How will mature tropical rain forests respond to dryer conditions, which some climate models suggest might be ahead in the not-so-distant future?
The 2005 drought in the Amazon basin gave scientists an opportunity to find out.
What they saw is not particularly heartening: Prolonged dryness has apparently turned some affected areas of the Amazon from a carbon sink to a carbon source, a team led by Oliver Phillips of Leeds University in Britain reports in Science today (Abstract here ).
Patches subjected to a 100-milimetre decrease in rainfall released on average 5.3 tonnes of carbon per hectare – around 9 times the amount undisturbed tropical forests take up, on average, per year.
Basin-wide, between 1.2-1.6 billion tonnes of carbon were released during the 2005 drought, the team estimates.
Cutting down forests will add carbon to the atmosphere, no matter which kind of land cover replaces the jungle.
But what’s happening in tropical forests that have long been undisturbed by logging, storms or fire?
Theoretically, the carbon balance of such old-growth forest – if tree growth and death are in equilibrium, that is - should be next to zero.
But apparently it’s not.
In a paper in Nature today (subscription), a team led by Simon Lewis of Leeds University in Britain reports that tree biomass in intact African forests increased between 1968 and 2007.
Across 79 plots monitored in ten countries large living trees added an average 0.63 tonnes of carbon per hectare each year.
Scaled up to the continent, and including roots, smaller trees and dead wood, African forests seem to have stored 340 million tonnes of carbon per year during recent decades.
Previous studies suggested that Amazonian forests are accumulating biomass and carbon at a similar rate.
Globally, intact tropical forests seem to take up 1.3 billion tonnes of carbon per year – equivalent to almost 20% of annual carbon dioxide emissions worldwide.
Researchers have discovered new hot spots for emissions of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide: barren patches of peat dotted across northern tundra.
And warming in the Arctic - just as it threatens to multiply emissions of carbon dioxide and methane from thawing permafrost and drying bogs - could accelerate the output of this lesser-known climate change culprit, according to a study in Nature Geoscience this week (subscription).
Nitrous oxide is the other other greenhouse gas .
In the new paper, Pertii Martikainen of the University of Kuopio in Finland and colleagues call it third most important behind carbon dioxide and methane, noting that it contributes a reported 6% to global warming.
It’s not been considered a player at all in the Arctic, where the few scientists who’ve looked for the gas have found negligible emissions.
But that’s because they’ve been looking in the wrong places, say Martikainen’s team.
Manipulating the waxiness of crops through traditional breeding techniques or genetic modification should raise their albedo by about 20%, from 0.2 to 0.24.
On the basis of climate modelling they calculate that the planet would cool by a modest 0.11 ºC.
"It's very small on the global average," says Ridgwell.
But "what is more important is the summertime effect in specific regions".
The mid-latitudes of North America and Eurasia could cool by as much as 1 °C in June, July and August, according to the models.
Ridgwell and his colleagues report their results in Current Biology.
The models also show pronounced cooling in the North Atlantic Ocean and the Barents Sea in the wintertime — which might have a positive effect on sea ice — but a drying out of the soil in some parts of the subtropics.
Ridgwell points out that climate models do not predict future precipitation well on a regional basis and treats the latter results more as evidence that there might be effects far from the fields being changed than as a clear indication that there would be damaging consequences.
Stimulating algal growth by adding iron to nutrient-poor ocean regions is one of several geo-engineering methods that could possibly mitigate greenhouse warming.
But given widespread worries about possibly harmful side-effects on marine life, large-scale ocean ‘fertilization’ is currently not considered advisable.
The team on board the German ‘ Polarstern ’, who plan to spread 20 tonnes of iron sulphate over less than 20 by 20 kilometres-large patch of ocean surface in the Scotia Sea, hope that the study will provide new insight into how ocean ecosystems respond to fertilization – the very data, hence, that are needed to assess whether or not larger-scale future activities might be justified.
But opponents counter that such doing already qualifies as an activity banned by UN law.
Pressure groups have launched a signature campaign aimed at stopping the Polarstern crew, which will reach its destination by the end of the week, from dumping its load.
Peat - "an accumulation of partially decayed vegetation matter", in Wikipedia's appetizing phrase - forms in bogs and swamps where the acidic, waterlogged, oxygen-poor soil smothers the decomposition process, just as permafrost freezes it out.
That makes it a big sink for carbon that would otherwise have joined the atmosphere as the plants composted.
But peat's not just a sink, it's a sump - and a snowballing one.
The large amount of water peat can hold lowers the oxygen available, which makes more peat accumulate, which sucks up more groundwater and blocks it from draining.
As Joseph Romm points out on Grist and Climate Progress , that potentially makes the peat loop a link in a bigger, and climatically more important, vicious circle - the one where temperatures raised by human emissions start an uncontrollable release of methane and carbon dioxide from natural stores like peat and permafrost.
If carbon dioxide is trump, then methane is the joker in the greenhouse game.
The flammable gas (CH4) is produced in wetlands, landfills and in the guts of cattle and sheep, and it is stored in vast amounts in so-called clathrates, or gas hydrates, in the ocean floor.
But not only in matters climate change there’s a danger of confusing people by media coverage that alternates between alarmism and appeasement.
Andrew Revkin of the New York Times has appositely termed the effect a journalistic whiplash for the public.
Although timidly questioned every so often, this apparently wrong postulate has prevailed for more than 30 years, leaving its mark in the Kyoto Protocol which excludes old-growth forests from national carbon budgets.
“Hence, 15 % of the global forest surface, which is currently not being considered for offsetting increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations, is responsible for at least 10% of the global net ecosystem production,” the authors write.
Obviously, the carbon sequestered in old forest was previously accounted for elsewhere.
Disturbingly, given that some offset profiteers praise tree planting as a panacea of sorts for climate change, young forests may actually be sources, rather than sinks, of CO2, if decomposition of soils and older vegetation preceded their creation.
Leaving intact and protecting old forests seems a far better option.
This insight comes rather late, but better late than never.
Oh, and it will really give climate negotiators something to think about.
For all tree huggers out there, this week’s Science is dedicated to ‘forests in flux’, paying tribute to the trees and their contribution to the greater good.
A special collection of articles in print, with complementary and online material, examines the fate of the world’s forests, in the face of climate change and an escalating human population.
Of particular relevance to discussions on how forests can mitigate global warming, Lera Miles and Valerie Kapos have a Perspective highlighting the risks involved in proposed schemes such as REDD (reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) and how to minimize them.
Also on this topic, Josep Canadell and Michael Raupach write on what science currently tells us is the best way to manage forests for sequestering carbon.
Drew Purves and Stephen Pacala discuss how forest dynamics remain one of the largest uncertainties in predicting future climate change and detail some of the efforts underway to improve their representation in models.
Or for a really solid review of how forests affect climate change, check out Gordan Bonan’s piece here .
Forests hold more than double the amount of carbon in the atmosphere.
GPP is Gross Primary Production, a measure of the daily output of the global biosphere --the amount of new plant matter on land.
NPP is Net Primary Production, an annual tally of the globe's production.
Biomass is booming.
The planet is the greenest it's been in decades, perhaps in centuries.
Judging by his record Mr Solomon likes to find new, surprising stories that over turn the evil IPCC-led consensus on climate science.
Not clear, though, that he's very successful: this is neither new nor surprising.
The work cited seems to be a 2004 paper by Steve Running and colleagues on monitoring NPP using the MODIS satellite data set ( BioScience 54, 547-560 (2004) -- pdf ), so it's hardly news.
What's more, everyone studying carbon dioxide levels agrees that there are "biological sinks" -- places where more carbon-dioxide means more biomass, either because of the direct carbon-dioxide-fertilisation effect (it is, after all, plant food) or because the climatic effects are to the benefit of plants.
Growth in sinks = growth in biomass.
And a billion tonnes of carbon or so flowing into sinks every year will add up, over time.
No denying that.
One of the more irritating aspects, if you will, of global change is that air pollution has so far prevented the planet from warming more rapidly than it actually did.
Clean air is of course a good thing.
But reducing pollution might expose an as of yet ‘masked’ portion of global warming.
This could have a dramatic affect on the Amazon rainforest.
A team led by Peter Cox of the University of Exeter, UK, reports in a paper in this week’s Nature that reductions in aerosol pollution will tremendously increase the risk of severe drought in the Amazon region.
Here is an editor’s summary of the paper.
Although it accounts for nearly a quarter of the world's fresh water, drought is not unknown in Amazonia.
In the dry season, from July to October, rainfall in the region is linked to sea surface temperatures (SST) in the tropical Atlantic.
In years with a pronounced temperature gradient - warming of the tropical Atlantic north of the equator relative to the south – the normal’ position of high and low atmospheric pressure systems can shift, delaying or suppressing the onset of the South American monsoon.
The effect has been observed in 2005, when large parts of the Amazon region were hit by the worst drought in decades.
See a Nature news story by Mike Hopkin here (subscription required) and a New York Times story here about the devastating event.
Cox thinks that the 2005 drought was a harbinger of things to come.
Their “simulations for the 21st century show a strong tendency for the SST conditions associated with the 2005 drought to become much more common, owing to continuing reductions in reflective aerosol pollution in the Northern Hemisphere.”
Droughts like in 2005 will happen every two years by 2025, and in nine out of ten years by 2060, the model suggests.
How robust is this dire prediction?
The Amazonian climate, for reasons not quite understood, is notoriously difficult to simulate.
But the Hadley Centre’s climate model which was used for this study has previously reproduced features of the regional climate with greater accuracy than other models.
In Mike Hopkin's words, “the ultimate fear is that the Amazon forest - often touted as an invaluable piece of armour against climate change - could become part of the problem rather than a key element of the solution.
Droughts make it more likely that it will become a net source of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, rather than mopping them up.”

The North Atlantic Ocean may still be an active storehouse for atmospheric carbon dioxide, said scientists at the European Geosciences Union here in Vienna yesterday.
Scientists have feared that the weakening trend could be a long-term impact of global warming and that it could be typical of the ocean as a whole, which absorbs an estimated 25 per cent of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions yearly.
If the ocean switches from a storehouse to a source of the greenhouse gas, this would jeopardise efforts to stabilise atmospheric greenhouse gas levels.
Speaking at a press conference at the EGU assembly yesterday, Ute Schuster from the University of East Anglia in Norwich, UK and Christoph Heinze at the University of Bergen, Norway, presented the results of a yearly analysis of carbon dioxide fluxes across the North Atlantic Ocean.
Previously, Schuster and colleagues showed that carbon uptake by the North Atlantic had halved between the mid-1990s and the early 21st century.
But further analysis of the data on a year-by-year basis has shown that the uptake of carbon dioxide in the region has been increasing since 2002 and showed an even greater increase, relative to the early 2000s, in 2005.
The reasons for this variation are unclear.
“I personally think we can’t say with confidence that the trend [in weakening sinks] is attributable to [anthropogenic] climate change”, says Schuster.
Surface circulation in the North Atlantic has changed in recent years, she says, but these changes could be due to natural climate variability.
Specifically, the North Atlantic Oscillation, a large-scale atmospheric pattern that has important impacts on European climate, could be influencing the rate of carbon dioxide uptake.
An interesting contribution from the comments thread on Lovelock and Rapley propose cure for global warming by Peter Williams which I thought I'd hoist up here for wider circulation.
-- Oliver
Lovelock and Rapley (Nature, 449,403, 2007) put forward the idea that by pumping up nutrient rich deep oceanic water, the subsequent stimulation of planktonic photosynthetic production would give rise to a very significant drawdown atmospheric CO2.
The concept is flawed scientifically on two accounts.
Planktonic photosynthesis results in the assimilation of inorganic nitrogen and CO2 in a ratio which has a modal value in the region of 6.6 – the so-called Redfield ratio.
A fraction of the organic particles that arise as a consequence of photosynthetic production, sink into the deeper parts of the ocean.
The C/N ratio of these particles is somewhat higher than the Redfield ratio, as there is some fast decomposition of the nitrogen (and phosphorus) rich organic components before the particles reach deep water.
The particles are eventually decomposed in the deeps, with the production in inorganic nutrients, along with CO2.
If this water, now enriched in inorganic nitrogen (and phosphorus), were brought to the surface, it would indeed stimulate planktonic photosynthesis and result in the assimilation of CO2.
However, the upwelled water is not only enriched in inorganic nitrogen but also CO2 produced at the same time, the latter being slightly in excess of the Redfield requirement due to the elevated C/N ratio of the settling particles.
Thus, rather than drawing down atmospheric CO2 from the atmosphere, there would be export of CO2.
The situation in fact would be worse, as the upwelled water would need to warm up (otherwise it would simply sink back again) this would reduce the solubility of CO2, resulting in further export of oceanic CO2 into the atmosphere.
The team, led by Harvard's Ken Feeley, suggests that if this sort of effect were repeated in bigger rainforests (most of which have only experienced marginal warming to date, as I understand it) then what are now stable stores of carbon would become net sources as theworld heats up.
This is obviously a considerably less optimistic scenario than the possibility that carbon-dioxide fertilisation would make them sinks.
It would presumably make the net effect of the increase in soil respiration that Peter Cox and others always stress ( Nature paper from 2000 ) an even worse problem.
Further to the post and subsequent discussion on Sunshades , which grew out of this article on geoengineering , I thought I'd point to the new paper by Damon Matthews and Ken Caldeira in PNAS ( Proc.
Natl. Acad.
Sci. USA, 10.1073/pnas.0700419104 ).
It's an interesting paper that has some fascinating insights into the links between climate and the carbon cycle, and I think contains some pretty bad news for would-be geoengineers.
The paper uses a University of Victoria inermediate complexity GCM along with a land cover and carbon cycle model (the Hadley Centre MOSES2 and TRIFFID -- which is pretty much the best acronym in the business) to track climate from 1900 to 2100, using historical data up to the end of the twentieth century and the IPCC A2 carbon-dioxide emissions scenario from then on.
Left to itself this gives a temperature increase of 3.5 centigrade over the 200 years.
They then compared this baseline to alternative scenarios in which geoengineering strategies were turned on and off at various times.
The geoengineering effect -- think of it as a layer of sulphates in the stratosphere, though the model wasn't that specific -- was calibrated to reduce the incoming sunlight in such a way as to counteract the radiative forcing of the carbon dioxide at any given time.
Various reports of this work have highlighted a fairly obvious subsequent finding: if you stop the geoengineering while having done nothing about carbon emissions you can get some truly horrendously quick warming; your protection vanishes almost instantaneously and the potential warming you have stored up by allowing carbon-dioxide levels to rise suddenly all appears at once.
Though it's nice to have some figures on this, it hardly comes as a surprise.
Stephen Schneider has been going on about the fact that once you start you can't stop for decades, and in Tom Wigley's Science article ( Science 314 pp.
452 - 454 (2006) DOI: 10.1126/science.1131728 ) last year, which explored the possibility of using a brief period of geoengineering to buy time in which to develop and field the technology needed for radical emissions reduction, there was a nasty looking blip in the warming rate at the point where the geoengineering was turned off.
But it's still a sobering thought.
While geoengineering through something like sulphate in the stratosphere is "reversible", in that if it starts having nasty effects you can just turn it off and the sulphate will fall out in a few years, that doesn't just leave you with the status quo ante -- it leaves you facing a far faster rate of warming that ypu have ever seen, and the adaptation challenges that go along with that.
There's an extra wrinkle in this paper, too; in the geoengineered world, you get increased carbon-dioxide uptake by the biosphere through the carbon-dioxide fertilisation effect on plants, but no offsetting increase in the carbon dioxide given off by soil respiration, which is taken to be temperature dependent.
Turn the geoengineering off and the resultant warming drives up soil respiration in a positive feedback, releasing yet more carbon dioxide and pushing temperatures yet higher.
It's a good example of the links between climate and the carbon cycle and the ways they can mess you up.
Not as good an example, though, as that offered by the precipitation outlook, which seems to me the most startling result here.
This week in Nature we have a news story on an attempt to follow up Frank Keppler's work on methane produced aerobically by green plants which we published early last year ( news story | paper ).
The Keppler piece, which suggested that methane emissions from green plants were a significant but previously unappreciated factor in global methane emissions, caused quit a lot of fuss, understandably, in the media -- since methane is a greenhouse gas which, over short time horizons, is about 75 times more powerful than carbon dioxide -- and quite a lot of befuddlement among plant scientists.
If it were true, it would have significant implications for the way that people model methane production, and the levels of production that one might predict in a warming world.
The debate rumbled on last year (another news report , this time by my colleague Quirin).
Both groups have criticized the other's choice of experimental method.
Dueck says that Keppler's group kept plants in sealed plastic containers instead of flow chambers, and exposed them to sources of stress such as bright sunlight and high temperature, which could have produced methane as an artefact.
Keppler retorts that the use of 13C is an artificial piece of chemical trickery with unknown effects on plant metabolism, and also argues that methane production can vary by up to three orders of magnitude between species.
On isoprene, this is as good a place as any to mention an interesting perspective by Manuel Lerdau in Science a few weeks ago on a possible isoprene-ozone positive feedback ( paper ).
Isoprene within leaves protects the plants that produce it against ozone.
But when isoprene gets out into the air, as it will, it can react with nitrogen oxides to make ozone.
Only some species produce isoprene, and so these isoprene-producing plants both protect themselves against ozone and, in Nox-rich environments, increase the ozone stress on their non-isoprene-producing neighbours.

In 1989, American environmentalist Bill McKibben wrote a book about climate change, for ordinary people.
In The End of Nature, McKibben sounded one of the first warnings that the industrial age was altering Earth and argued that unless greenhouse gas emissions were cut back, the planet would change irrevocably.
“I wrote The End of Nature and thought, 'People will read this and be all set,'” he says.
Governments would limit greenhouse gas emissions.
Citizens would change their expectations.
Some 20 years later, the global average temperature is still rising.
So it's perhaps unsurprising that McKibben's latest book, eerily titled Eaarth, reflects a darker view.
In Eaarth, McKibben writes that now it's clear Earth will never be the same; it ought to be renamed.
Collaboration requires communication, and communication is always better in person, but should climate researchers travel less?
Stohl has detailed the carbon emissions of scientists and non-scientists at his institute in a paper recently published in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics.
The emissions are certainly not jaw-dropping, but he raises a couple of interesting points.
For one, why is international collaboration between climate researchers—which usually requires some air travel— so strongly encouraged by funding agencies without an eye cast to how the hopping on planes might be minimised?
And to what extent is it for the climate change community to set an example to the rest of science—and to professionals of all stripes?
Yes, most researchers in the field care passionately that their work informs policies that changes people’s behaviour.
But only a quarter of attendees at the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry conference in September have sent back questionnaires about the fuel they burnt to get there.
Without more completed questionnaires, the organisers are having a tough time calculating the total carbon emissions, and thus how much they are aiming to off-set.
Although timidly questioned every so often, this apparently wrong postulate has prevailed for more than 30 years, leaving its mark in the Kyoto Protocol which excludes old-growth forests from national carbon budgets.
“Hence, 15 % of the global forest surface, which is currently not being considered for offsetting increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations, is responsible for at least 10% of the global net ecosystem production,” the authors write.
Obviously, the carbon sequestered in old forest was previously accounted for elsewhere.
Disturbingly, given that some offset profiteers praise tree planting as a panacea of sorts for climate change, young forests may actually be sources, rather than sinks, of CO2, if decomposition of soils and older vegetation preceded their creation.
Leaving intact and protecting old forests seems a far better option.
This insight comes rather late, but better late than never.
Oh, and it will really give climate negotiators something to think about.
Declan Butler has a feature (subscription required) in this week's Nature on the potential of green architecture for mitigating climate change.

Jake Rice, who heads up Advice and Assessment at the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans, just delivered an interesting talk here on the conflict between global food security and fisheries managment policies.
Rice says that he and his co-author, economist Serge Garcia, are concerned that measures to conserve marine biodiversity are in contradiction with policies to protect food security, with the likely upshot that both will fail to address their respective goals.
The conundrum is straightforward: by mid-century, there’ll be an additional 2 billion people on earth, each of whom will need to eat.
In total, they’ll require an extra 3.65*108 of dietary protein.
Forecasts suggest that we’ll need an 11% increase in irrigation for grain production just to keep pace with human population growth, not withstanding the impacts of climate change on crops and water availability.
Right now, one-third of the world's population relies on fish and fisheries products for at least one-fifth of their annual protein intake; if that continues to be the case, we’ll need around 70 million metric tonnes more fish protein by 2050, says Rice.
That's something like 75-100% of current fish protein production.
So how can we generate this and manage our fisheries?
Rice outlines several possible options, each of which involves a conflict with environmental management.
One option is to extend fish farming in coastal areas, but that has the associated problems of pollution and the escape of farmed fish into the wild.
Also, fish farming requires protein input in the form of fishmeal, so that raises other sustainability issues.
Another option is to fish more in highly producivity regions, but aren’t those the same regions we should be setting aside as Marine Protected Areas?
The problem, says Rice, is that these clearly conflicting policy goals aren’t being looked at by the same people at a high enough level.
Now that the old problem of fisheries governance is being met with the newer problems of climate change and rapid population growth, we need a merger of these discussions, he says.
He’d like to see the Convention on Biological Diversity pay more attention to the sustainable food dimension of their mandate and the Food and Agricultural Organization speaking with the CBD at a higher level.
Eventually, says Rice, the UN General Assembly should be the forum to look at merging and prioritizing these policies.
But can we have our cake and eat it?
"We can't have full conservation of marine biodiversity and a well nourished additional 2 billion people on Earth", says Rice.
Ah, how about the followon questions: as we reduce biodiversity--fishing for jellyfish and krill--what happens to our ability to feed those people over time, with less and less biodiversity?
This is why we shouold take care of our natural resources for once it is taken away from us we will all sufer, should we wait for the natures revenge?
we must take some actions now before it is too late for all of us.

Former chief science advisor to the UK government David King once said that last month’s talks in Copenhagen would be the “last chance saloon” for tackling climate change.
But there is hope beyond Copenhagen, says King.
Olive Heffernan reports.
The Accord is important because it establishes the 2 °C target as a global commitment, and before it was only a European Union commitment.
It’s also the first time we recognize globally that poor countries have to be supported in dealing with the impacts of climate change and in technology transfer, in a very real sense, by creating a flow of cash.
And thirdly it includes the commitments to emissions reductions from all developed countries.
But the accord doesn’t go far enough.
In your book The Hot Topic, you said that Copenhagen was the “last chance saloon” for avoiding dangerous climate change.
Is that still your view?
What is the next important milestone for climate policy?
In my view, between now and November — when the next UN climate conference will take place in Mexico — the G20 needs to establish a clear timeline towards a global cap-and-trade scheme.
I certainly believe that the UN conference is the place where a final deal needs to take place, but it almost has to be a rubber stamp.
If we leave negotiators to meet twice a year we see very little progress, but as soon as we see heads of state step in, we see progress.
I’m all for a simplification and a re-examination of the Kyoto Protocol.
Global trade is the ultimate objective.
We need a single scheme with a single price on carbon dioxide.
Gordon Brown’s idea of creating a flow of money of US$100 billion a year by 2020 to poor nations is micromanaging a process that would be much better managed through a trading scheme.
I think it’s unrealistic to expect to have cap and trade [among] all developed nations by 2012, but I think this will be more feasible by 2020.
In the meantime I’m fairly certain that we will have a set of parallel processes, with the US, the EU and [others] having their own cap-and-trade systems.
I’m very keen to see the EU Emissions Trading Scheme invite some African countries into it, if their emissions are below two tonnes of carbon dioxide per person per annum and they can stay below two tonnes.
Anjali Nayar, an International Development Research Centre fellow at Nature, recently visited a pioneering project in Madagascar that's aiming to protect one of the country's few remaining forests.
About 90% of the species in Madagascar's rainforests are found nowhere else on Earth, but efforts to save the island nation's forests are about more than conserving biodiversity.
It's hoped that projects like this will provide a model for efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation.
Under a proposal, known as reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD), wealthy nations could meet their emissions targets in part by buying carbon credits from developing countries such as Madagascar.
REDD is one of the topics up for discussion at the UN climate-change conference in Copenhagen this December.
Countries will negotiate whether REDD should be included in the global climate deal that takes over from the Kyoto Protocol.
After months of saying that recession wouldn’t stop climate policy plans in Australia, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced yesterday that the country’s cap-and-trade program is in fact going to be delayed a year and will not roll out until July 2011.
As Roberta Kwok wrote in Nature last month, Rudd’s Labour party government had called for a 5% emissions cut from 2000 levels by 2020 - to be raised to 15% if an ambitious global climate deal is reached in Copenhagen - but the proposed legislation was under fire from both the right and left.
The Financial Times notes that Greens in the Australian Senate had demanded a 40% cut with a global deal, while conservative opposition parties wanted the plan delayed to cushion the impact on businesses.
Rudd met the Greens halfway, raising the conditional 15% target to 25%.
Industry got extra soothing with a new tweak: fixed carbon prices for the first year ( The Age has details).
Halfway around the world, British Columbia may also be about to take a U-turn on a climate policy milestone.
Nicola Jones reports in Nature today that the province has been uneasily bearing the burden of North America’s first carbon tax.
The BC Liberal Party started the tax in July, but their challengers in an upcoming election on 12 May are against it.
Jones writes:
Stimulating algal growth by adding iron to nutrient-poor ocean regions is one of several geo-engineering methods that could possibly mitigate greenhouse warming.
But given widespread worries about possibly harmful side-effects on marine life, large-scale ocean ‘fertilization’ is currently not considered advisable.
The team on board the German ‘ Polarstern ’, who plan to spread 20 tonnes of iron sulphate over less than 20 by 20 kilometres-large patch of ocean surface in the Scotia Sea, hope that the study will provide new insight into how ocean ecosystems respond to fertilization – the very data, hence, that are needed to assess whether or not larger-scale future activities might be justified.
But opponents counter that such doing already qualifies as an activity banned by UN law.
Pressure groups have launched a signature campaign aimed at stopping the Polarstern crew, which will reach its destination by the end of the week, from dumping its load.
After eleven months of legislative work, the European Parliament gave its backing today to the European Union’s (EU) climate change package which aims to ensure that the EU will achieve its self-set climate targets by 2020: a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions relative to 1990 levels, a 20% improvement in energy efficiency, and a 20% share for renewables in the EU energy mix.
It’s well accepted that the upcoming climate talks in Poznan will not be the time or place for agreeing the architecture of a new deal on climate change.
An idea that is less well received, but one that is gaining traction, is that the same could be true of the negotiations in Copenhagen a year from now.
While the election of Barack Obama as US president brings renewed energy and hope to the UN process, President Bush will be holding court when environment ministers from some 192 nations meet next week in Poznan.
And with Harlan Watson in place as the US chief climate negotiator, any serious shifts in the US position will be on hold until January.
In addition, some are speculating that even the modest ambitions of the talks — to settle how to finance emissions cuts and aid adaptation in developing countries — are likely to be eclipsed by the world's financial woes.
But of far graver concern are the growing reports that the US won’t be ready to sign a global deal on climate change in Copenhagen either, given the time needed to enact domestic climate legislation.
As far back as October, Elliot Diringer, Director of International Strategies at the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, wrote the following in an op-ed for the Transatlantic Climate Policy Group :
Any near-term action may come in the form of energy legislation that, while helping to reduce U.S. emissions, will not achieve the levels of reduction envisioned under a cap-and-trade scenario.
Enactment of a comprehensive climate package, including cap-and-trade, is unlikely in 2009.
It may come at the earliest in 2010.
Is the global financial crisis good or bad for green issues?
The ongoing controversy over the European Union’s ambitious climate and energy package suggests the latter might be the case.
But political and economical analysts seem to be increasingly confident that the current crisis might give rise to environmentally healthier policies and investment decisions.
An editorial in this week’s Nature lays out the options and prospects for EU climate policies in light of the financial crisis:
“Striking the required bargains may require more time than the remaining two months under French presidency.
But a well-weighed set of rules is far and away preferable to a rushed political compromise that would substantially water down the EU’s ambitious climate plan.
(…) Meanwhile, the current economic turbulence cannot be allowed to serve as a pretext for lessening climate protection efforts.”
Any agreement will come too late for the international climate talks next month in Poznan, Poland (of all places).
But a strong European commitment to cutting greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20 % would be a much-needed signal to the UN climate meeting in Copenhagen 2009, where nations hope to conclude on a successor treaty to the Kyoto Protocol .
The European Parliament’s environment committee yesterday voted largely in favour of the ambitious European climate action plan (subscription) proposed in January.
The decision, although preliminary, allows the European Union (EU) to go into the upcoming next round of international climate negotiations with a common goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions across Europe by at least 20 % by 2020.
The European commission, Council and Parliament must yet formally agree on details of the plan, but substantial changes are now considered unlikely.
Introduced in 2005, the ETS is as yet the only mandatory emissions trading system in the world.
Until now, power stations and other large European industries have benefitted from generous supply of free permits to release carbon dioxide.
Much of the commission’s proposed reform was aimed to end the over-allocation of emission allowances.
The environment committee did make some concessions to industry, though.
The threshold for facilities – currently around 10,000 - which participate in the ETS is to be raised from 10,000 to 25,000 tonnes of annual carbon dioxide emissions.
Ross Garnaut, the down-under equivalent of Nicholas Stern , offered up a draft report Friday on the costs of climate change in Australia and an emissions trading scheme for dealing with it.
If global warming goes unmitigated, Garnaut figures projected GDP will drop 4.8% and real wages 7.8% by 2100.
Agriculture is one sector set to take a beating - and that's in the context of droughts that have already dug into Asia's rice supply (thanks to Grist for link; more on climate, energy and global food supply here ).
(A bit bleak, no?
Other countries have called their climate policies leadership , not life support.
)
Australian carbon trading won't make the difference between ruin and recovery, says the report - only a global emissions market will.
For any hint of progress on that front, look to this week's G8 summit, where Olive Heffernan is blogging from Hokkaido for Climate Feedback.
For all tree huggers out there, this week’s Science is dedicated to ‘forests in flux’, paying tribute to the trees and their contribution to the greater good.
A special collection of articles in print, with complementary and online material, examines the fate of the world’s forests, in the face of climate change and an escalating human population.
Of particular relevance to discussions on how forests can mitigate global warming, Lera Miles and Valerie Kapos have a Perspective highlighting the risks involved in proposed schemes such as REDD (reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) and how to minimize them.
Also on this topic, Josep Canadell and Michael Raupach write on what science currently tells us is the best way to manage forests for sequestering carbon.
Drew Purves and Stephen Pacala discuss how forest dynamics remain one of the largest uncertainties in predicting future climate change and detail some of the efforts underway to improve their representation in models.
Or for a really solid review of how forests affect climate change, check out Gordan Bonan’s piece here .
Forests hold more than double the amount of carbon in the atmosphere.
Whether and how to put a price on carbon has been something of a hot topic this week, primarily due to the proposal of a landmark climate change bill to the US Senate that would "cap and trade" emissions of the greenhouse gas.
Perhaps somewhat unsurprisingly, the climate change bill offered by Senators Boxer, Lieberman, and Warner died today in the Senate after Democrat leaders fell a dozen votes short of the 60 needed to defeat Republican obstruction .
Republicans opposed the global warming bill over fears of the economic costs of pricing the greenhouse gas, though Democrats argued there would be no cost to consumers, who would be aided with tax relief.
The debate over "cap and trade" legislation is now expected to be postponed until next year, when there is a new president in the White House.
The issue is taken up this week on Nature Reports Climate Change by Roger Pielke Jr who reviews Earth: The Sequel by Fred Krupp and Miriam Horn of the Environmental Defense Fund.
The basic tenet of the book is that a US carbon market with tradable credits would provide the profit incentive needed to energize potential innovators of low or no-carbon technology – thus meeting the world's escalating demand for green energy.
But Pielke Jr argues:
By placing their attention on the need for innovative energy technologies, Krupp and Horn have focused on the one area where advocates for action on greenhouse gas reduction are in strong agreement.
They have avoided engaging in the real debate over the policies necessary to decarbonize the growing global economy and, crucially, over whether and how to put a price on carbon dioxide.
Meanwhile, over on Dot Earth , Andy Revkin has written about an alternative, though less popular, pricing approach known as “cap and dividend”.
The scheme, being strongly endorsed by NASA climatologist James Hansen, is based on the principle of making the polluter pay without placing the burdening of rising costs on the consumer, the most commonly cited down-side of "cap and trade" (discussed by Pielke Jr in the above review).
Revkin explores two proposals for “cap and dividend”: one by Hansen that involves taxing fuels by their carbon content, and another by investment pioneer Peter Barnes that entails selling a steadily declining number of permits for emitting carbon dioxide.
The latter would force polluters to eventually pay the full whack of their carbon consumption, and the revenue would be returned to citizens.
You can read the full story here .
Reuters reported Friday that the long-awaited Montreal Climate Exchange will open on May 30, buying and selling voluntary emissions reductions in the same fashion as the Chicago Climate Exchange , its US partner.
But absolute emissions isn't what they'll limit - they're talking about regulating emissions intensity, or the amount of emissions per unit of production, from 2010.
That could make it tough to integrate into a global climate deal, since the EU caps absolute emissions and all three US presidential candidates want to do the same.
Interestingly, the plan also mandates carbon capture and storage for oil sands, a carbon-intensive economic lynchpin of the country.
Besides the voluntary market, local measures could already be in play when and if these limits come down.
British Columbia is leading the way with what is to be the first carbon tax implemented outside of Europe.
Although the tax hasn't been looking very popular and faces the same too-much-is-never-enough criticism that the EU climate bill came in for , liberal leader Stephane Dion now says he'd like the national strategy to be a carbon tax - or something.
Anything. "We can talk about what the best model for putting a price on carbon across Canada might be –– but the fact is we need to JUST DO IT.
That is what this provincial government has done, and that is what a Liberal government will do," Dion said in a speech in Vancouver.
Following on from Jeff's post on Supercallifragalistic Tuesday, Chris Mooney has a post on his blog and a column elsewhere on the differences between McCain on one side and Obama/Clinton on the other on matters climatic.
Writing before Romney dropped out of the race but after it was fairly clear he had little reason to stay in, Chris's point is that while it's true that all three of the people who might be the next President support real action on climate change, which is an undeniably good thing, they don't all support quite the same sort of action.
Specifically, while the Deomocrats are talking about cap and trade measures that would lead to 80% reductions in emissions by 2050,
There are many reasons to think [McCain would] settle for a policy that is more lenient and compromise-oriented.
Notably, McCain worked closely with Senator Joseph Lieberman on climate legislation in the past, and the current bipartisan Lieberman-Warner bill sets a lower target for emission reductions – a 70 percent reduction in capped emissions by 2050 (and not all emissions would be capped).
The European Commission's draft blueprint for tackling climate change, announced January 23rd, is praised in today's Nature editorial for hitting "the sweet spot" between politically pragmatic but shortsighted proposals and implausably idealistic ones.
Other groups - idealists and pragmatists alike - have reacted differently.
Europe and the US could be headed for a trade war over climate change.
As anticipated , deforestation has emerged as something of a thorny issue at the UN conference on climate change, currently nearing a close in Bali.
It was announced yesterday that measures to avoid further destruction of tropical forests, such as the Amazon, will be included in the agreement to come out of the talks at the end of this week.
The Bali agreement is expected to act as a guideline for negotiations on an international climate change deal up until the end of 2009.
Daniel Nepstad of Woods Hole Research Centre, US said today in Bali that the Amazon rainforest is expected to see a 55% dieback by 2030 through deforestation, logging and drought.
Rainforests in other nations, such as Indonesia are facing similar pressures.
So, any effort to avoid deforestation, which accounts for an estimated 20-25% of global greenhouse gas emissions, is to be commended.
But the solution being put forward to in Bali , known as REDD - Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation, is being met with opposition on many sides.
Under the proposed scheme for ‘avoided deforestation’, carbon sequestered by forests in developing countries that are not being cut can be traded on the carbon market, where developed countries can buy the credits and ‘offset’ them against their own emissions targets.
A draft text on deforestation is ready to go forward for discussion by the high level ministers, who arrived at the Bali conference today, said executive secretary of the UN conference on climate change, Yvo De Boer.
Countries such as Indonesia and numerous conservation NGOs are celebrating inclusion of the scheme.
And given that emissions from deforestation were omitted from the Kyoto Protocol, it is the first such international effort of its kind.
But much remains to be agreed upon.
The issue of whether such a scheme should include forest conservation is a remaining “bone of contention”.
As reported in the Hindustan Times, the Indian delegation wanted to add 'conservation' to 'avoided deforestation' , owing to the fact that India is one of the few developing countries where the forest cover is going up, not down.
“We should not be penalised for that” said secretary of the ministry of environment and forests, Meena Gupta
How expensive is climate change, what's the cost of stopping it, and should we pay now or pay later?
Scientific American gets a three-sided look at these questions in side-by-side interviews with Nicholas Stern , Bjorn Lomborg and Gary Yohe .
There's an interesting commenary in Nature this week (currently free to access) by Steve Rayner of the James Martin Institute in Oxford and Gwyn Prins of the LSE , arguing that while emissions abatement is a global priority, the Kyoto Protocol is the wrong tool for the job -- a one-size-fits-all approach that, among other failings, doesn't actually look likely to deliver the reductions that it has promised.
Unfortunately, as they argue, this sub-optimal approach has developed an iconic status of its own, so that in many minds to be against Kyoto is tantamount to being against any form of action on climate.
They're worried that this means people will uncritically attempt to follow up the Kyoto protocol (which expires in 2012) with a son-of-Kyoto that contains many or all of the same flaws, when they should be having a much more radical rethink.
The Kyoto Protocol is a symbolically important expression of governments' concern about climate change.
But as an instrument for achieving emissions reductions, it has failed.
It has produced no demonstrable reductions in emissions or even in anticipated emissions growth.
And it pays no more than token attention to the needs of societies to adapt to existing climate change.
The impending United Nations Climate Change Conference being held in Bali in December — to decide international policy after 2012 — needs to radically rethink climate policy...Already, in the post-Kyoto discussions, we are witnessing that well-documented human response to failure, especially where political or emotional capital is involved, which is to insist on more of what is not working: in this case more stringent targets and timetables, involving more countries.
The next round of negotiations needs to open up new approaches, not to close them down as Kyoto did.
Here is the situation: Annex I countries that cannot meet their GHG emissions targets under the Kyoto Protocol pay into the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) fund, which then pays for emissions reductions in developing countries.
These emissions reductions can take many forms as long as "additionality" can be proven – that is, the reduction in GHGs would not have occurred without the CDM funding.
CDM projects have included capturing landfill-produced methane, creating facilities to burn biomass for energy, and installing wind power capacity.
However, CDM projects have also included burning HFC-23 and this is where the perverse incentive creeps up.
HFC-23 is the byproduct of HCFC-22 production.
HCFC-22 is a refrigerant and strong ozone depletor, ostensibly banned by the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer.
Developing countries, however, were given a loophole arrangement under the Montreal Protocol (MP) specifically for HCFC-22, so while most countries in the world with any degree of industrial activity have agreed to abide by the MP, developing countries do not have to meet HCFC-22 phase-out targets.
Because of this loophole, as a cheap and effective refrigerant HCFC-22 continues to be an important industrial chemical, produced in especially high volume by "rich developing" countries such as China, India and Korea.
Both HCFC-22 and HFC-23 are also strong greenhouse gasses, but HFC-23 has a 270-year lifetime in the atmosphere, HCFC-22 only 12 years, and thus HFC-23 has over ten times the Global Warming Potential of HCFC-22 at 14,800 times CO2-equivalent (see Table TS.2 in the WGI Technical Summary of IPCC AR4 ).
Those seeking to fund CDM projects jumped early at the chance to abate the release of HFC-23 to the atmosphere.
It turned out to be quite easy (read: cheap) to install capture-and-burn equipment on HCFC-22 factories, and with a ton of HFC-23 burned being the equivalent of over 14,000 tons of CO2 prevented from reaching the atmosphere, the race to fund HFC-23 burn projects was on.
The problem from an international policy perspective is that producers of HCFC-22 now make more money burning HFC-23 than they do selling HCFC-22.
Imagine what being paid handsomely to burn your waste does to your incentive to reduce your waste.
If your waste stream costs you to dispose of it, you might try to improve your production to reduce waste and thus save money.
And even if you did get paid to burn your waste, it might make financial sense to reduce waste anyway if your efficiency improvements paid more in reduced operating expenses than burning waste generated in income.
But neither is the case for HCFC-22 factories.
For them a double financial incentive now exists: keep making HCFC-22 in copious amounts at a profit, which will produce HFC-23 as a now-valuable waste product.
And since HCFC-22 producers need not even lift a finger to burn their HFC-23 (those funding the CDM project fund the capture and burn device), any incentive for switching away from the ozone-depleting HCFC-22 as a refrigerant is also destroyed.
Aside from very good in-depth reporting from Fiona Harvey of the Financial Times, based in part on the work of Michael Wara of Stanford (see the 8-Feb-07 issue of Nature ), the HCFC-22/HFC-23 issue has gone largely unreported thus far.
While the New York Times has run a small handful of articles in the past year on HCFC-22 and its ozone-depleting properties, none have raised the HFC-23 specter.
According to my Lexis-Nexis search, no other American newspaper has covered the issue.
As individual states in the U.S. begin forming interstate agreements on GHG trading in advance of a federally-instituted nationwide emissions reduction program, unintended consequences like depleting stratospheric ozone in favor of reducing GHGs will need to be carefully watched for.

Kudzu vines have become a wide-spread but unwelcome sight throughout much of the southeastern United States.
The noxious weed – native to Asia and once planted to prevent soil erosion – has spread rapidly, smothering native species in its wake.
But the vine may be wreaking atmospheric havoc as well.
In a paper in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , Jonathan Hickman of Stony Brook University and colleagues find that invasion of the vine more than doubles nitric oxide emissions and increases ozone pollution.
Though not a greenhouse gas itself, NO is a precursor to ozone, which when formed in the lower atmosphere, is a greenhouse gas and major pollutant.
What’s more, kudzu is also a prolific emitter of the biological hydrocarbon isoprene, another chemical implicated in ozone production.
With hot, humid summers, the southeast is a particular hotspot for ozone formation.
Hickman’s team finds that an extreme invasion of kudzu could actually increase the number of days with dangerously high levels of ozone.
The team warns that warmer winters and higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations could drive a northward expansion of the vine, with localized outbreaks already reported in New York, Maine and Ontario.

Since 1994, around 750 cubic kilometers of floating ice – equivalent to the volume of Lake Titicaca in Bolivia – have been melting each year around the Arctic Ocean and off Antarctica, an analysis of satellite observation has revealed.
The massive loss of sea ice actually adds a wee bit to global sea level rise, scientists report in a paper in Geophysical Research Letters.
Popular belief has it that the melting of drifting icebergs and floating ice shelves has no effect on the height of the surrounding sea level just like melting ice cubes in a drink don’t make your glass overflow.
But because sea water is warmer and more salty than ice this is not quite correct.
In fact, melting sea ice does raise seal level by about 2.6 % of its volume – equivalent to the difference in density between fresh- and sea-water, the team reports.
Globally, the effect is almost negligible: Retreating Arctic sea ice and thinning ice shelves around Antarctica contribute about 50 micrometers, or half a hairbreadth, to the 3 millimeter or so annual rise in global sea level from melting glaciers and thermal expansion of ocean water.
Sea level contribution from floating ice might strongly increase in a warming climate, he says.
If all present-day floating ice were lost, global sea level would rise by up to 6 centimetres.
Having mulled the topic of sea level rise for some time, I decided it was a topic that I’d like to cover in more detail.
The upshot of all this is the latest issue of Nature Reports Climate Change, which attempts to answer my two initial questions:
But first, for those who haven’t followed this issue closely, a bit of background.
When the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its assessment report on global warming in 2007, it was faced with a tough decision on what to say about sea level rise.
In estimating how sea levels might rise in the future, the panel considered several factors such as how much the oceans will expand as they warm and how much water will be added from melting mountain glaciers and ice caps.
But for one potentially important source of sea level rise – the break up of large ice sheets covering Greenland and West Antarctica – there was little information.
After some consideration, the IPCC estimated a total sea level rise of 18 to 59 centimetres by the 2090s, a projection that excluded the contribution of the world's largest ice sheets on the basis that understanding was too limited “to provide a best estimate or an upper bound”.
A number of studies published since the last IPCC assessment report have estimated much higher levels of sea level rise this century – in some cases more than 2 metres by 2100.
Rather than considering the various processes that individually contribute to sea level rise, these semi-empirical approaches are based on the idea that the rate of sea level rise is proportional to the amount of global warming and they use past sea level and temperature data to quantify this effect.
Stefan Rahmstorf - who published some of the first work using this method back in 2007 - writes that “the difference between the semi-empirical estimates and the model-based estimates of the IPCC can be attributed largely to the response of continental ice to greenhouse warming”.
His most recent study, with Martin Vermeer, gives a median estimate of 124 centimeters of sea level rise by 2100 or 114 centimeters by 2095.
But, write Jason Lowe and Jonathan Gregory write in a seperate commentary , the question remains as to how much the break up of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets will contribute to sea level this century.
On this, the jury is still out, they say.
Yes, satellite observations show that both ice sheets are losing mass overall and that the speed of outlet glaciers (which spit large chunks of ice into the ocean) has increased of late, but, say Lowe and Gregory, this may be due to natural variability and, as such, it may not continue.
Rahmstorf attributes the high end of his recent estimate to the fact that as temperatures rise, more ice will melt and some of that will be from ice sheets.
Ultimately loss ice will depend on local climate, not on whether that ice is locked up in mountain glaciers or in ice sheets, says Rahmstorf.
As he puts it “we’re not going to run out of ice to melt anytime soon”.
Lowe and Gregory, on the other hand, say that high estimates from semi-empirical methods can be attributed to large dynamical changes in ice sheets only if there was a large contribution from ice sheets to sea level in the past.
They say that this wasn’t the case (because the contribution from ice sheets has only increased in recent years), and that as such, these studies lack a plausible physical mechanism to explain the projected rise in sea level.
But Rahmstorf contends that, based on recent observations, loss of continental ice could be responsible for as much as 80 percent of future sea level rise, making his estimate of 114 centimetres by 2095 feasible.
The world’s carbon dioxide ‘sinks’ are not able to keep up with the amount of the greenhouse gas being produced, according to a paper published in Nature Geoscience .
Reviewing the recent literature Corinne Le Quéré, of the University of East Anglia, and colleagues report that between 1959 and 2008 43% of each year’s carbon dioxide emissions have remained in the atmosphere with the rest being absorbed by land and ocean sinks.
However in the last 50 years they suggest that the fraction remaining in the atmosphere has increased from about 40% to 45%.
“The Earth’s carbon sinks are complex and there are some gaps in our understanding, particularly in our ability to link human-induced CO2 emissions to atmospheric CO2 concentrations on a year-to-year basis,” says Le Quéré ( press release ).
“But, if we can reduce the uncertainty about the carbon sinks, our data could be used to verify the effectiveness of climate mitigations policies.”
The Institute of Marine Engineering, Science and Technology – an international body that traditionally has represented marine industry and more recently, scientists too – today released its position statement on climate change .
Immersing yourself in the impacts of extreme climate change can give rise to a certain amount of gallows humor.
Conversation among my dinner companions last night turned to whether this week's 4 Degrees and Beyond conference or March's Copenhagen Climate Congress provided "more apocalypse for your conference fee".
The far more serious question, of course, is how much upheaval and human suffering would come with the substantial warming that delegates here are contemplating.
Some interesting talks today looked at the facets of sea level rise and population displacement.
Stephan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impacts Research had an intriguing update on a 2007 Science paper in which he'd come up with a new method for projecting sea level rise.
Rahmstorf throws out any attempt to use complex climate models on this controversial problem and instead starts from scratch, with observed relationships between temperature rises and sea level rises.
Now, working with Martin Vermeer of the University of Technology in Helsinki, he's upgraded the extremely simple equation he used in 2007 to an only slightly less simple equation - one that takes account of the rate of warming and the amount of water that humans sequester in reservoirs.
They use this to reconstruct a remarkably faithful record the last millennium's sea levels.
Turning it to IPCC temperature projections, the team finds that sea level rise by 2100 could range, depending on the emissions scenario, from 0.75 to 1.9 metres, and a 4-degree world would likely see 0.98 to 1.3 metres of rise this century.
A caveat: the recent sea-rise data that inspired and calibrated this equation and the past data that it explains don't include the full effects of melting ice sheets that could lie ahead.
That means 0.75 to 1.9 metres may be a conservative estimate.
But if we're concerned with how creeping seas affect coastal populations, the amount of rise is not the only matter to settle.
This was a key argument made by Francois Gemennes of the Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations in Paris.
Gemennes' talk was based on a study of environmentally induced migration that I covered earlier this year.
When it comes to climate refugees, he says, the numbers that are often tossed around - such as 200 million new migrants by 2050 - are based on the assumption that greater climate impacts will push more people around.
What they aren't based on is empirical data about how populations respond to environmental change.
But according to the recent EACH-FOR project - the first global-scale survey of environmental migrants - the size of impacts isn't the crucial variable at all: migration largely depends on policies making it possible for people to react to impacts by migrating.
In particular, Gemennes argues, the poorest and most vulnerable will not be able to migrate unless they are given resources and exit routes - if we don't encourage migration as an adaptation strategy, they'll be trapped in the frying pan (or flooding delta).
The next event of the conference is a panel discussion on "4 degrees of climate change: alarmist or realist?
", which I'll be tracking over on Twitter.

Zooplankton are fish food.
O’Connor tells New Scientist , "The effect could be translated up the food chain" to a gain in fisheries, but “that top-heavy food web structure could be less stable, and crash all together.
" The group found that the consumer boom was much greater when nutrients were added, so they suggest that food webs in nutrient-poor waters - such as the ocean surface - may be more resilient to climate change.
The study is timely: NOAA’s National Climatic Data Center recently announced that world ocean temperatures were the hottest on record last month.
The temperatures beat the 20th-century average by nearly 0.6 degrees Celsius.
According to AP , meteorologists are attributing the record high to a combination of global warming trends, an El Nino phase just getting started, and other natural variation.
Apparently, an unusual and unexplained weather pattern this summer is concentrating warmth over the ocean while land surfaces stay cooler.
Breaking heat records in water is more ominous as a sign of global warming than breaking temperature marks on land, because water takes longer to heat up and does not cool off as easily as land.
"This warm water we're seeing doesn't just disappear next year; it'll be around for a long time," said climate scientist Andrew Weaver of the University of Victoria in British Columbia.
In the latest salvo of the scientific debate over future sea level rise, a new report counters claims that rapidly swelling seas will soak estimates published by the UN climate planel in 2007.
A major “it’s worse than we thought” story out of March’s Copenhagen Climate Congress, for example, was that sea level could climb more than a metre by 2100 - seemingly far worse than the rise of up to 59 centimetres indicated in the 2007 report from the Intergivernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
This was in fact something of a straw-man comparison, since the IPCC total explicitly excluded the impacts of accelerated glacier melt, and the new studies were attempting to add these impacts in.
Blankets of low clouds shield and cool the Earth’s surface - but in a warming climate, will this safety blanket thicken, or will it deteriorate?
That question has bugged climatologists for decades.
A paper published in Science today (subscription) now offers convincing evidence that warming leads to fewer clouds, and thus exposure to more warming.
The data showed that over the climatic ups and downs since the 1950s, periods of warming have dispersed the clouds.
The authors then compared 18 global climate models to see if they could match the observations.
Of these, just two showed the correct relationship between temperature, circulation and clouds - and only one of the pair, from the UK’s Hadley Centre, also responds to greenhouse gas forcing in a manner that matches the average response of the 18 models.
Some glacial periods in the Earth’s more recent geological past have been cooler and more severe than others, despite very similar greenhouse gas concentrations and orbital parameters.
What is it that decouples global temperature from carbon dioxide levels and the solar heat?
Changes in ocean circulation, particularly in the climatically crucial North Atlantic region, are the most likely candidate.
A paper in Nature (subscription required) now suggests that some of these changes originate more than 10,000 kilometres away in the subtropical Indian Ocean.
Edouard Bard and Rosalind Rickaby analysed an 800,000-year record of sea surface temperature and ocean productivity from an ocean sediment core retrieved off the southeastern coast of South Africa ( Editor's summary ).
This is the region where a portion of the warm and salty water carried southwards by the Agulhas current, the Indian Ocean equivalent to the Gulf Stream, leaks into the South Atlantic.
The inflow compensates for the export of cold Atlantic deep water to other ocean basins.
More importantly, it fuels the Atlantic overturning circulation which carries warm tropical surface water towards the poles, and cold deep water back towards the equator.
As the Earth has alternated between glacial and inter-glacial periods, the steep climatic ups and downs have gone hand in hand with changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.
But where was the CO2 going to and coming from?
Scientists have pointed to the ocean – currently a vast sponge for the greenhouse gas.
But a talk at the AGU Chapman Conference today by palaeoclimatologist Lowell Stott of the University of Southern California suggests a radically different reservoir: pools of liquid carbon dioxide trapped in seafloor hydrothermal vents.
The CO2 pools form when one oceanic plate buckles under another and carbonates in the sediment break down under the intense heat.
Perforations around underwater volcanic vents can allow CO2 droplets to escape and bubble up to the surface, but where the seawater is cold enough it effectively freezes the CO2 into a solid, or hydrate, form that acts as a lid.
NOAA has a further explanation and diagram .
Stott points out that the carbon isotope signatures in some mid-latitude ocean sediment don’t tally with the conventional view of carbon entering the ocean system via photosynthesizing algae.
The chemistry of the sea-vent carbon is a much better match, he argues.
What's more, unpublished work by Stott and colleagues shows that past changes in deep sea temperatures around the vents would have been sufficient to destabilize hydrate caps and thus modulate the vents' release of CO2 in time with the rising and falling atmospheric CO2 concentrations.
The system of surface and deep currents which make up the Atlantic Ocean circulation, a powerful heat conveyor belt and a poster child for abrupt climate change, is a more complex affair than straightforward textbook diagrams suggest .
In a Mexican eco park, of all places, scientists have found compelling evidence that sea-levels can rise – nah, jump – at scary rates during warm climates such as ours.
That the global sea-level can rise by almost half a metre per decade when huge glaciers melt towards the end of an ice age has already been known.
But a paper in Nature today ( Editor’s summary ) suggests that a similar jump has occurred at the close of the sea-level ‘highstand’ during the warm period, the Eemian Interglacial.
The team, led by Paul Blanchon of the National Autonomous University of Mexico in Cancun, analyzed the age structure of exceptionally well-exposed coral reefs at Xcaret, a popular theme park on the northeast Yucatán peninsula.
Because no earthquakes have occurred in the more recent geological history of the region, the peninsula is an ideal location to study sea-level behaviour.
The team found that at the end of the last interglacial many reefs were flooded and replaced by new reefs on higher ground.
Age and layering of the corals indicate that a rapid 2-3 metres jump in sea-level occurred around 121,000 years ago, possibly within less than one century.
Only swift and substantial melting of Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets can explain the extreme rate at which the seal level rose to its highstand some 4-6 metres above today’s sea-level.
The implications for our warming planet are clear.
As modern temperatures approach those at the height of the Eemian Interglacial, the rate of seal-level rise could soon – perhaps very soon - shift gear, from modest to catastrophic.
The spectacular break-up of the Wilkins Ice shelf off the Antarctic Peninsula is a reminder that we are getting closer to the point where things could get really nasty.
“Given the dramatic disintegration of ice shelves and discovery of rapid ice loss from both the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, the potential for sustained rapid ice loss and catastrophic sea-level rise in the near future is confirmed by our discovery of sea-level instability at the close of the last interglacial,” the authors conclude.
A controversial experiment which poured iron into the Southern Ocean has also poured cold water on the idea that such ‘ocean fertilization’ can mitigate against climate change.
The Lohafex project was investigating suggestions that carbon dioxide can be removed from the atmosphere by promoting algal blooms with iron.
Despite protests from some groups , researchers aboard the Polarstern research vessel carried out their experiment this month.
However, the Alfred-Wegener institute, which was backing Lohafex, says “only a modest amount of carbon sank out of the surface layer by the end of the experiment.
Hence, the transfer of CO2 from the atmosphere to the ocean to compensate the deficit caused by the LOHAFEX bloom was minor compared to earlier ocean iron fertilization experiments.”
During the last ice age, the northern and southern polar regions danced between warm and cold periods, but the two were out of step with each other.
When the Arctic cooled, the Antarctic warmed and vice versa.
To explain this polar offset, paleoclimate researchers have proposed that the answer lies in the oceanic conveyor-belt system of currents that transport heat around the globe.
A new paper by Stephen Barker of Cardiff University and his colleagues (subscription) offers evidence to support this model.
That team describes a detailed record of the end of the ice age, as witnessed by plankton and geochemical proxies from a site in the South Atlantic Ocean at 41 degrees S. Those indicate that the changes there happened abruptly, just as they did in the North.
Past studies of records from Antarctica had suggested that the transitions were gradual in the far South, which potentially presented a problem for the conveyor-belt model, says Jeffrey Severinghaus in a News and Views this week.
The new data, however, suggests that in the mid-latitudes, the southern Atlantic see-sawed from cold to warm and back quite quickly, matching predictions made by the conveyor model.
It also points toward a mechanism for how the ice age ended.
The trigger would have been the periodic Milankovitch changes in Earth’s orbit, which increased the amount of sunlight hitting the northern high latitudes during summer starting around 22,000 years ago.
The extra energy started melting the northern ice sheets, thus dumping considerable amounts of freshwater into the North Atlantic.
That, in turn, slowed the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)—the conveyor belt that carries cold water from the North Atlantic into the deep ocean and eventually to Antarctica.
With an anemic AMOC, the Southern Ocean warmed up and released carbon dioxide stored in the deep ocean, thereby turning up the earth’s thermostat enough to melt the northern ice sheets, suggest Barker and colleagues.
Severinghaus goes even farther.
If the slow-down in AMOC did cause a massive discharge of carbon dioxide from the southern Ocean, that should give us pause, he says.
Models predict that AMOC should weaken in response to global warming, which could release enough carbon dioxide to finish off some of the ice sheets left standing from the last glacial period, he suggests.
Moreover, current climate projections do not take into account this positive feedback, which could amplify the warming effects of the pollution we put into the atmosphere.
I may need to start a file for ‘ocean impacts we hadn’t thought of’.
First there was the projection that the seas will get noisier as a result of ocean acidification, which whale conservation groups were running with at a UN conference in December.
Now researchers report in PNAS that ocean acidification may make fish larvae lose the sense of smell they use to find a home.
But they and their colleagues report that clownfish larvae reared in aquariums at pHs of 7.8 and 7.6 don’t respond to smell tests the same way as control fish.
These pHs are low compared to the 8.15 the fish live with today, but a business-as-usual rise in carbon dioxide emissions could take the ocean to 7.8 by 2100 and 7.6 in the following century.
One question the paper doesn’t take up is whether an ocean pH of 7.6 would leave any reefs for clownfish to come back to.
The danger to reefs, and other better-known impacts of acidification, have meanwhile been highlighted in a declaration by 155 ocean scientists from 26 countries - and they want action.
The Indo-German LOHAFEX experiment in the Southern Ocean, suspended two weeks ago , can be conducted as planned.
Independent reviews sought by the German science ministry concluded that the experiment is in agreement with environmental standards and international law.
On Tuesday, the team on board the German Polarstern started dumping its cargo of 20 tonnes of iron sulphate.
The ship will stay around the area for around six weeks, giving the scientists’ enough time to observe the growth and decay of an ‘artificial’ algal bloom.
The CROZEX study was conducted in 2004 and 2005 near the Crozet archipelago at the northern boundary of the Southern Ocean.
Raymond Pollard of the National Oceanography Centre Southampton and his team found that natural iron fertilization, by dust supplied from the Crozet Islands, increases biological production and the amount of organic carbon taken down into the deep ocean.
That’s not particularly surprising.
But what’s amazing is this: The amount of carbon sequestered to 200 metres depth, while 18 times greater than that during an artificially induced bloom (like LOHAFEX), was a stunning 77 times smaller than the amount that had previously been determined during a natural bloom in the nearby Kerguelen region.
What’s more, carbon flux at 3,000 metres, where carbon dioxide sucked up at the surface would be safely locked away for centuries, was just 3% of that at 100 metres.
Check out this week's Nature podcast and the paper here (subscription)
“CROZEX carbon sequestration for a given iron supply (…) falls 15-20 times short of some geo-engineering estimates,” the authors conclude.
This, you’ve guessed it, has “significant implications for proposals to mitigate the effects of climate change through purposeful addition of iron the ocean.”
It has indeed.
The Nature news story here makes the point that the findings, if they hold up, could actually be the final blow to such proposals.
The notion that putting a little iron into the oceans here and there will suck up most of the surplus atmospheric carbon dioxide is pretty much dead, so it seems.
Alas, it was just too good to be true.
Carbon dioxide emitted today - and the warming it causes - could stick around for centuries or millennia, reported Mason Inman over on Nature Reports Climate Change not long ago.
New research (subscription) published online in Nature Geoscience this week looks at the impacts of CO2 emissions on the global ocean over a timescale even longer and less imaginable.
Because warm water holds less oxygen than cold water, oceans are expected to lose some of the dissolved gas as a consequence of climate change.
This is already happening in certain tropical regions.
Using a low-complexity model of the Earth system, Gary Shaffer of the University of Copenhagen and colleagues now find that the full effects of ocean warming and deoxygenation could lag thousands of years behind changes in the atmosphere - and that oxygen levels may not fully recover for the next 100,000 years.
Their projections are based on two IPCC emissions scenarios: A2, a high-emissions world, where carbon dioxide emissions climb through this century, and B1, a more moderate scenario, where emissions peak by around 2050.
In both cases, Shaffer et al.
assume emissions rapidly fall to zero after 2100.
The researchers also try two levels of ‘climate sensitivity’ - the amount of global warming expected for a doubling of CO2 concentration.
The number of these underwater deserts has reportedly been doubling each decade since the 1960s, fueled not just by warming but by agricultural runoff - which is expected to increase with flooding in some regions (see this 2008 review in Science; subscription).
Other studies have suggested that rapid dead zone expansion this century will be driven by high levels of marine carbon.
As Shaffer et al's models don't seem to include these effects, their estimates could run low.
Stimulating algal growth by adding iron to nutrient-poor ocean regions is one of several geo-engineering methods that could possibly mitigate greenhouse warming.
But given widespread worries about possibly harmful side-effects on marine life, large-scale ocean ‘fertilization’ is currently not considered advisable.
The team on board the German ‘ Polarstern ’, who plan to spread 20 tonnes of iron sulphate over less than 20 by 20 kilometres-large patch of ocean surface in the Scotia Sea, hope that the study will provide new insight into how ocean ecosystems respond to fertilization – the very data, hence, that are needed to assess whether or not larger-scale future activities might be justified.
But opponents counter that such doing already qualifies as an activity banned by UN law.
Pressure groups have launched a signature campaign aimed at stopping the Polarstern crew, which will reach its destination by the end of the week, from dumping its load.
At a conference this week, marine scientist Andrew Lenton of the Université Pierre et Marie Curie presented a new model that sketches out a beautiful causal chain: from the ozone hole over Antarctica, to rising southern winds, to stronger Southern Ocean currents, to more deep-sea stored carbon arriving at the sea surface.
The simulation, which Lenton reported at a meeting of the CARBOOCEAN research consortium in Dourdan, France, is the first coupled carbon-climate model to account for what biogeochemists have recently seen in the Antarctic waters.
As I noted last month , observations (Science, subscription required) suggest the Southern Ocean's considerable carbon dioxide sink isn't soaking up as much of the gas as climate modellers expected, perhaps because there's already too much dissolved in surface waters.
That means more climate-warming carbon accumulates in the atmosphere.
By bringing in stratospheric ozone damage, which earlier studies had excluded, the model of Lenton and his colleagues manages to reproduce the recent disappointing sink - a step toward resetting future projections.
Also known as overturning, deep convection transports cold water to depths of more than 1000m, bringing carbon dioxide with it and keeping the greenhouse gas out the atmosphere for centuries.
It's also partly reponsible for maintaining the global climate system, as we know it - at high latitudes, deep convection forms a mass of cold water that drives the Atlantic oceanic conveyor belt and carries warm water northwards.
In the past decade, however, the process of deep convection has been sluggish, causing some to speculate that warming of surface waters due to climate change is already taking its toll on ocean circulation.
According to one long-term prediction , the Earth’s oceans - our greatest natural ally in any war on climate change - will soak up 70 to 80% of the entire industrial era's anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions over the next several centuries .
The Southern Ocean accounts for some 15% of that storage.
Last year, however, a widely reported study (Science, subscription required) led by the University of East Anglia’s Corinne Le Quéré concluded that the Southern Ocean’s ability to absorb the gas was weakening.
The Southern Ocean has proved more resilient to global warming than previously thought and remains a major store of mankind's planet-warming carbon dioxide, a study has found.
Actually, though, the Boening et al.
paper doesn’t evaluate carbon-soaking ability - current and wind speeds are what it's all about.
In contrast, storage capacity is the primary concern of Le Quéré et al.
So the direct contradiction between today's story, Southern Ocean changing but still major CO2 sink , and the 2007 Reuters report on Le Quéré et al., Southern Ocean saturated with carbon dioxide , looks like an oversimplification.
A paper this week in Nature (subscription) sheds new light on the causes of pronounced greenhouse-gas and climate fluctuations during glacial times.
The last ice-age, which covered the period from around 110,000 to 10,000 years before now, is famed for a series of climate swings known as Dansgaard-Oeschger events .
Scientists have found evidence in Greenland ice cores for abrupt warming episodes of up to 15 degrees Celsius within few decades, followed by a more gradual cooling.
These glacial warm and cold periods swung back and forth between the poles in a kind of thermal seesaw effect, whereby Antarctic temperatures rose when Greenland temperatures dropped, and vice versa.
It has long been assumed that Dansgaard-Oeschger events were triggered by changes in Atlantic ocean-circulation.
The new modelling study by Andreas Schmittner and Eric Galbraith now adds new evidence to the idea.
Weakening Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, the heat conveyor which carries warm water surface water northwards and cold deep-water back south, is indeed the primary physical mechanism driving glacial climate fluctuations, they conclude.
Here’s an editor’s summary .
Schmittner and Galbraith carried out simulations with a coupled model of glacial climate and (simplified) biogeochemical cycles.
When they manipulated the Atlantic circulation – artificially ‘switching’ it off and on in their model, that is - the model nicely reproduced the temperature changes typical for Dansgaard-Oeschger events.
Remarkably, the model also reproduced reasonably well the ice-core-derived changes in atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse-gases carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide which accompany such events.
Cyclones appear to be responsible for a large amount of organic carbon tied up in ocean sediments.
In a paper published in Nature Geoscience, Robert Hilton and colleagues report on the impact of cyclone-induced floods on carbon in the LiWu River in Taiwan.
They found that between 77 and 92% of non-fossil carbon eroded from the LiWu catchment area was moved during floods linked to cyclones.
As increased sea surface temperatures from global warming could increase the intensity of cyclones, this could create negative feedback, with bigger cyclones locking up more organic carbon in sediments.
Sadly this is not going to stop global warming.
If carbon dioxide is trump, then methane is the joker in the greenhouse game.
The flammable gas (CH4) is produced in wetlands, landfills and in the guts of cattle and sheep, and it is stored in vast amounts in so-called clathrates, or gas hydrates, in the ocean floor.
But not only in matters climate change there’s a danger of confusing people by media coverage that alternates between alarmism and appeasement.
Andrew Revkin of the New York Times has appositely termed the effect a journalistic whiplash for the public.
As residents of New Orleans prepare to return home and breathe a sigh of relief that Hurricane Gustav was less damaging than feared, new research published today in Nature [subscription] suggests that the strongest tropical cyclones will pick up speed in the coming decades.
Weighing in on the long-running and at times very stormy debate over whether and how warmer seas will affect the intensity and frequency of hurricanes is a team led by climatologist James Elsner of Florida State University.
Using a 25-year archive of satellite data, Elsner and colleagues derive wind speeds for tropical cyclones over the globe.
They find that the maximum wind speeds reached by the strongest tropical cyclones increased from 1981-2006 in most ocean basins, with the greatest changes in the North Atlantic and Northern Indian Oceans.
There was no trend in the intensity of cyclones occuring over the South Pacific, however, and the upward trend observed over a couple of ocean regions was not statistically significant.
The researchers also found no increase in either the frequency or average intensity of tropical cyclones over the globe.
The approach taken by Elsner and colleagues – looking at whether the most severe cyclones will hit a higher speed limit during their lifetime – is both novel and socially relevant, simply because the most severe storms do the most damage if they make landfall.
Once tropical cyclones reach speeds of over 74mph, they are officially classified as hurricanes.
The real bone of contention within the scientific community has been whether hurricanes will become more intense and more frequent as a result of human-induced climate change.
Elsner and colleagues steer well clear of linking the trend to global warming though - they can’t attribute cause as their study doesn’t investigate other factors such as cyclone origin and duration, proximity to land, El Niño conditions and solar activity.
The North Atlantic Ocean may still be an active storehouse for atmospheric carbon dioxide, said scientists at the European Geosciences Union here in Vienna yesterday.
Scientists have feared that the weakening trend could be a long-term impact of global warming and that it could be typical of the ocean as a whole, which absorbs an estimated 25 per cent of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions yearly.
If the ocean switches from a storehouse to a source of the greenhouse gas, this would jeopardise efforts to stabilise atmospheric greenhouse gas levels.
Speaking at a press conference at the EGU assembly yesterday, Ute Schuster from the University of East Anglia in Norwich, UK and Christoph Heinze at the University of Bergen, Norway, presented the results of a yearly analysis of carbon dioxide fluxes across the North Atlantic Ocean.
Previously, Schuster and colleagues showed that carbon uptake by the North Atlantic had halved between the mid-1990s and the early 21st century.
But further analysis of the data on a year-by-year basis has shown that the uptake of carbon dioxide in the region has been increasing since 2002 and showed an even greater increase, relative to the early 2000s, in 2005.
The reasons for this variation are unclear.
“I personally think we can’t say with confidence that the trend [in weakening sinks] is attributable to [anthropogenic] climate change”, says Schuster.
Surface circulation in the North Atlantic has changed in recent years, she says, but these changes could be due to natural climate variability.
Specifically, the North Atlantic Oscillation, a large-scale atmospheric pattern that has important impacts on European climate, could be influencing the rate of carbon dioxide uptake.
It’s been quite a while since the Gulf Stream was last on the Nature cover .
This week the old highlight is back.
Now that’s a topic which has caused an awful lot of confusion before.
“How global warming will cause the next ice age”, stuff like that.
So just to be clear: the Gulf Stream is the mostly wind-driven upper limb of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation , which ceaselessly transports warm surface water from the Caribbean to middle and high latitudes on the other side of the Atlantic.
Yes, ceaselessly.
As long as the Earth keeps rotating there’s really nothing in the world (not even global warming) that could bring it to a halt.
It is common knowledge - and true - that the British Isles and Scandinavia enjoy a much warmer climate than Newfoundland or Labrador thanks to the Gulf Stream.
But its climatic influence goes far beyond that, a US-Japanese team report in a paper in Nature this week.
They detected the Gulf Stream’s signature in the entire lower atmosphere - namely in air and cloud temperatures, rain bands, pressure fields and wind convergence - above its meandering cross-Atlantic course, and far inland in Europe.
That the influence of the Gulf Stream might penetrate deeply into the atmosphere has been previously assumed.
Firm evidence that this is indeed the case, and vehemently so, comes from the combination of satellite observations, operational weather analysis and atmospheric circulation models which the team utilised for their study.
Very likely the Gulf Stream’s direct local effects on the atmosphere are tele-connected, via planetary atmospheric waves, with weather conditions in far-away regions.
How frequent and pronounced these remote responses might be is not at all clear.
But it seems at least as if Gulf Stream-driven atmospheric dynamics over the North Atlantic have a marked influence on hemisphere-wide climatology.
This, you’ve guessed it, adds another piece to the climate change puzzle.
Come what may, the Gulf Stream will not ‘run dry’.
But its strength does vary, and a possible weakening of the Atlantic overturning circulation, to which it belongs, is unlikely to leave the Gulf Stream unaffected.
A new ice age will not come over Europe because of that, but storm tracks and rainfall patterns could be affected in rather unpredictable ways.
You can vote or comment on the importance of the new Gulf Stream paper in the Journal Club of Nature Reports Climate Change.
If you like coral reefs you should enjoy them while you can, they won’t be around for long.
Global warming and the ocean acidification that comes with it will decimate reefs by the end of this century, according to a new review article in Science.
“The impact of climate change on coral reefs is much closer than we appreciated.
It's just around the corner,” says study author Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, of the University of Queensland.
“... The warmer and more acidic oceans caused by the rise of carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels threaten to destroy coral reef ecosystems, exposing people to flooding, coastal erosion and the loss of food and income from reef-based fisheries and tourism.
And this is happening just when many nations are hoping that these industries would allow them to alleviate their impoverished state.” ( Reuters ... Telegraph )
Although there is no new original research here, when all the numbers are brought together they are pretty frightening.
Atmospheric carbon dioxide will exceed 500 parts per million sometime between 2050 and 2100.
This will drive global temperatures up at least 2°C, “values that significantly exceed those of at least the past 420,000 years during which most extant marine organisms evolved” says the paper.
The appearance of a massive swarm of jellyfish, and their subsequent decimation of an Irish salmon farm, are this week being blamed on global warming.
This isn't the first time climate change has been linked to jellyfish outbreaks.
Last summer, the same jellyfish (Pelagia notiluca) was spotted in unusually high concentrations in the Mediterranean, again prompting speculation about impacts of sea temperature rise ( New Scientist ).
Reuters reported that a volunteer campaign had removed eight tons of jellyfish from the Spanish coastline.
Both reports mention temperature and decline in predators as causes.
A recent study linked increasing populations of jellyfish in the North Sea to climate change and predicted that more jellyfish would appear over the next 100 years.
If the two events are truly linked the UK's salmon industry may have to be added to the list of climate change victims.
An interesting contribution from the comments thread on Lovelock and Rapley propose cure for global warming by Peter Williams which I thought I'd hoist up here for wider circulation.
-- Oliver
Lovelock and Rapley (Nature, 449,403, 2007) put forward the idea that by pumping up nutrient rich deep oceanic water, the subsequent stimulation of planktonic photosynthetic production would give rise to a very significant drawdown atmospheric CO2.
The concept is flawed scientifically on two accounts.
Planktonic photosynthesis results in the assimilation of inorganic nitrogen and CO2 in a ratio which has a modal value in the region of 6.6 – the so-called Redfield ratio.
A fraction of the organic particles that arise as a consequence of photosynthetic production, sink into the deeper parts of the ocean.
The C/N ratio of these particles is somewhat higher than the Redfield ratio, as there is some fast decomposition of the nitrogen (and phosphorus) rich organic components before the particles reach deep water.
The particles are eventually decomposed in the deeps, with the production in inorganic nutrients, along with CO2.
If this water, now enriched in inorganic nitrogen (and phosphorus), were brought to the surface, it would indeed stimulate planktonic photosynthesis and result in the assimilation of CO2.
However, the upwelled water is not only enriched in inorganic nitrogen but also CO2 produced at the same time, the latter being slightly in excess of the Redfield requirement due to the elevated C/N ratio of the settling particles.
Thus, rather than drawing down atmospheric CO2 from the atmosphere, there would be export of CO2.
The situation in fact would be worse, as the upwelled water would need to warm up (otherwise it would simply sink back again) this would reduce the solubility of CO2, resulting in further export of oceanic CO2 into the atmosphere.
The 2007 hurricane season is about to get officially underway.
Never mind that nature has already provided the first named storm in the North Atlantic: Andrea.
Several forecasts suggest that the 2007 season in the North Atlantic will be well above average.
Sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are above normal and atmospheric conditions look likely to be favorable for tropical storm activity.
In 2005, the record breaking year in the North Atlantic, record high SSTs in the critical region from 10 to 20 degrees N in the North Atlantic provided ample fuel for the 28 named storms (normal about 15, previous record 21 in 1933) and 15 hurricanes (normal about 6, previous record 12).
Atmospheric conditions were favorable with weak wind shear (that otherwise tends to tear a vortex apart) and the absence of stable layers that prevent convection from developing.
In contrast in 2006, SSTs were much lower and closer to the long term normal, and the atmospheric conditions were not favorable, as a developing El Niño in the Pacific created an atmospheric circulation that increased the wind shear in the Atlantic.
This year, in 2007, there is no El Niño in the Pacific, and SSTs and the upper ocean heat content are more favorable for Atlantic storms.
There seems to be general agreement on these points, yet the whole issue of Atlantic hurricanes is mired in controversy over the role of global warming.
It is not a disagreement that SSTs are higher but rather whether the warming is due to natural processes such as the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation or global warming.
To the public, the result is the same for now.
To me this is obvious: global warming is “unequivocal” to quote the recent IPCC Working Group I report and global SSTs have increased about 0.6 degrees C. In the last half century this warming is associated with increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
It is not possible that the Atlantic has escaped from this warming.
The latest shot fired on this issue was by Chris Landsea in Eos on the long term Atlantic hurricane record.
The Atlantic has the best record of tropical storms owing in part to aircraft surveillance since 1944.
It is widely recognized that the older records are less reliable as the reports depend on shipping or landfall of the storms.
Landsea makes this case quite well, but he goes further.
He assumes that the percentage of landfalling storms should be constant over time and this provides a basis for adjusting the older records and increasing the numbers of storms by 2.2 per year from 1900 to 1965, when the satellite era began.
The critical assumption is that this fraction should remain the same, yet it is abundantly clear that SSTs have increased and so other things have not remained the same.
Given the dependence of hurricanes on high SSTs above about 26 degrees C, shouldn’t increased SSTs increase the scope for storms to develop farther to the east over what were colder waters and for the tracks to become longer?
An example may be Vince in October 2005, which was the first tropical storm to make landfall in Spain and Portugal.
Indeed shouldn’t one expect a decreasing fraction of landfalling storms in a warming climate?

Tipping points - those critical thresholds in a complex system where a small nudge can cause a catastrophic response - are perhaps the most fearsome threats to the Earth’s climate, but they also haunt ecosystems, financial markets, and even sufferers of medical conditions such as epilepsy and asthma.
A fascinating review in Nature today (subscription) sketches out the mathematical patterns on which many of these instances seem to be based, and describes giveaway signs that might warn us to change course before the system tips.
Last week marked the start of a US$5 million project to study the effects of thawing permafrost on ecosystems in the Arctic.
Based at the Toolik Field Station in northern Alaska and sponsored by the US National Science Foundation, the project will look at the impact of thermokarsts — the scars and pits left behind as melt water from permanently frozen ground leaks away, and soil and rock collapses in its wake.
My colleagues and I were flying over the high Arctic in search of research sites.
We noted that the Toolik River was brown and muddy, which was odd as it hadn't rained recently.
As we went further upstream, we came to a tiny stream that was washing tons of thermokarst sediments into the river.
We were astounded how this tiny feature was influencing the river 40 kilometres downstream.
The volume that had been displaced was enough to smother the bottom of the entire river.
The sediments would release a lot of nutrients normally locked up in permafrost into freshwater cycles.
That's got to have a significant impact on the ecosystem.
There has been quite some controversy over the total size of the Northern Hemisphere’s terrestrial carbon sink, so this first comprehensive estimate, published in Nature today , is filling a real gap.
Given China’s 1.2 billion population and rapidly growing economy, knowledge of how much of its emissions are actually staying in the atmosphere is pretty valuable information.
Globally, around 40% of annual emissions stay in the atmosphere; the rest is sequestered by plants, soils and oceans.
The Chinese data come at a time of growing speculation and guesswork over the People's Republic’s future climate and energy policies.
Needless to say, the study is of no small relevance with a view to upcoming climate negotiations.
The very fact that China’s land carbon sink is large is good news.
But the results will also strengthen the Chinese government’s negotiation position at the United Nations climate summit in December in Copenhagen.
Actually, says climate scientist Mark B. Boslough, “if you’re going to stay up late at night worrying about something, worry about climate.” Boslough, a researcher at the Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico, US, says, “you are much more likely to die from climate change than from an asteroid impact by a factor of something like a thousand.” He presented his findings at the Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco, California.
Boslough cannot put a precise number on that ratio, because climate science is still replete with gaps in the relevant data.
He is much more confident about the asteroid threat, though.
He says that there is no evidence that anyone has died from an asteroid or meteorite impact—ever.
He does not make a distinction between asteroids and meteors, saying the latter are basically fragments of the former and there is no size boundary to distinguish one from the other.
Looking at worst case scenarios for asteroid impacts and climate change over the next 100 years, Boslough estimates that the largest asteroid to impact Earth would be around 50 metres in diameter.
It would explode in the atmosphere and not make an impact crater, he says, and it would kill no one.
Asteroids larger than 50 metres across and likely to cross Earth’s orbit are rare, and the larger they are, the rarer they are.
They are also well tracked.
Smaller ones are more numerous, but even less likely to cause death and destruction on Earth.
There’s a line around the block to give advice to Barack Obama, the latest offering being a 400-page environmental policy paper backed by 29 NGOs (hat tip to Climate Progress ).
Amid the many recommendations, a proposed bureaucratic shake-up of US Earth science has also resurfaced.
Cyclones appear to be responsible for a large amount of organic carbon tied up in ocean sediments.
In a paper published in Nature Geoscience, Robert Hilton and colleagues report on the impact of cyclone-induced floods on carbon in the LiWu River in Taiwan.
They found that between 77 and 92% of non-fossil carbon eroded from the LiWu catchment area was moved during floods linked to cyclones.
As increased sea surface temperatures from global warming could increase the intensity of cyclones, this could create negative feedback, with bigger cyclones locking up more organic carbon in sediments.
Sadly this is not going to stop global warming.
Peat - "an accumulation of partially decayed vegetation matter", in Wikipedia's appetizing phrase - forms in bogs and swamps where the acidic, waterlogged, oxygen-poor soil smothers the decomposition process, just as permafrost freezes it out.
That makes it a big sink for carbon that would otherwise have joined the atmosphere as the plants composted.
But peat's not just a sink, it's a sump - and a snowballing one.
The large amount of water peat can hold lowers the oxygen available, which makes more peat accumulate, which sucks up more groundwater and blocks it from draining.
As Joseph Romm points out on Grist and Climate Progress , that potentially makes the peat loop a link in a bigger, and climatically more important, vicious circle - the one where temperatures raised by human emissions start an uncontrollable release of methane and carbon dioxide from natural stores like peat and permafrost.
The Great Plains of the United States, late twenty-first century: breadbasket or dust bowl?
It may depend on groundwater storage, finds a study published in Nature Geoscience this week (subscription required).
The results are based on an unusually sophisticated watershed model that connects the below-ground water sources, surface water and the land surface itself.
That merger would ring a few nostalgic bells, since NOAA was once also called ESSA (for Environmental Science Services Administration).
And it would bureaucratically marry the atmospheric and ocean research at NOAA to the terrestrial, freshwater and biological studies at the USGS.
To face the daunting agenda of “climate change, sea-level rise, altered weather patterns, declines in freshwater availability and quality, and loss of biodiversity,” the authors say, the US needs massive scientific support from an integrated, streamlined institution - one as seamless as the Earth system itself.
Such plans would have to be hashed out over and above the decision to put ESSA together, however.
Meanwhile, trying to mesh the USGS and NOAA missions could have interesting effects.
What would happen, for example, to NOAA's marine fisheries programs?
NOAA is housed in the Department of Commerce, where commercial fishing interests are sometimes seen to clash with conservation.
Mark Schaefer, former USGS director and the ESSA proposal’s lead author, said creating the hoped-for independent, nonregulatory agency might mean moving fisheries regulation to the Fish and Wildlife Service in the Department of the Interior, where protecting natural resources is key.

In 1989, American environmentalist Bill McKibben wrote a book about climate change, for ordinary people.
In The End of Nature, McKibben sounded one of the first warnings that the industrial age was altering Earth and argued that unless greenhouse gas emissions were cut back, the planet would change irrevocably.
“I wrote The End of Nature and thought, 'People will read this and be all set,'” he says.
Governments would limit greenhouse gas emissions.
Citizens would change their expectations.
Some 20 years later, the global average temperature is still rising.
So it's perhaps unsurprising that McKibben's latest book, eerily titled Eaarth, reflects a darker view.
In Eaarth, McKibben writes that now it's clear Earth will never be the same; it ought to be renamed.
This week's Nature [subscription required] is the third in a series of special issues celebrating the life of Charles Darwin.
It focuses on the dire challenges to Earth's biodiversity — and finds some reason for hope.
Among the numerous biodiversity-related contributions is an opinion piece by Will Turner of Conservation International with Michael Oppenheimer and David S. Wilcove of Princeton University.
They argue that natural ecosystems offer some of our greatest tools in mitigating climate change and, as such, must be made a bulwark against climate change, rather than a casualty of it.
They write:
REDD is just one of many possible ways to exploit the potential of natural ecosystems to slow climate change and lessen its effects on people.
Natural habitats are a hugely valuable tool in the fight against global warming.
Use them wisely and they could save many lives and vast sums of money in the decades to come.
Abuse them, and much of Earth's biodiversity could be lost, along with the fight against climate change.
Urgent action is needed to understand how best to exploit this promise and develop mechanisms that can be woven into the practices of governments, corporations, communities and institutions worldwide.
Turner and co-authors say that natural ecosystems are a clear mitigation option because of their sequestration potential, but also because "the maintenance and restoration of natural habitats are among the cheapest, safest and easiest solutions at our disposal in the effort to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and promote adaptation to unavoidable changes".

I've just returned from a two-day visit to the UK Met Office, where scientists are gathered this week to present and discuss the results of a five-year research initiative known as Ensembles.
An EU-funded project led by the Met Office Hadley Centre, Ensembles brought together 66 research international institutes with the express aim of developing climate models and projections and applying the newly developed tools to studying climate impacts on agriculture, health and other sectors.
One of the most exciting outcomes from Ensembles is the development of a climate mitigation scenario and its analysis by a variety of state-of-the-art climate models, many of which include carbon cycle feedbacks.
As I explain over on Nature News, this is a radically different approach from the gold-standard climate projections, which are run by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the United Nation's climate body.
Up until now, the IPCC has run models for a range of 'what if' scenarios that make various assumptions about the future, such as the level of emissions, technological and economic development.
None of these scenarios account for the impact of policy on climate change.
The Ensembles scenario, known as E1, works the other way around.
It assumes that atmospheric levels of CO2 equivalents cannot rise above 450 parts per million if we are to avoid 'dangerous' climate change of more than 2 ºC and then looks at the mitigation that policy-makers would need to pursue to achieve that.
Most of the models suggest that emissions will need to be near zero by 2100 in order to stabilize atmopsheric concentrations at 450 ppm.
But the Hadley Centre model, HadCM3, suggests that we'll need to start actively removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere - by artifical or natural means - by 2050, if we are to keep temperatures within a 'safe' level.
International climate policy is largely focused on reducing emissions of carbon dioxide.
But even if we reduce emissions now, a proportion of CO2 will stay in the atmosphere for millennia.
A faster-acting strategy is needed if we’re to avoid dangerous climate change in the short term.
That’s the message from a team of experts writing in the latest issue of PNAS.
What’s needed to mitigate climate change fast, Nobel laureate Mario Molina and colleagues argue, is a focus on phasing out short-term warming agents.
They pinpoint four non-CO2 gases and particles that could be regulated under existing legislation.
Complementing cuts in CO2, these faster-acting mitigation strategies could “begin within 2–3 years, be substantially implemented in 5–10 years and produce a climate response within decades”, write the authors.
Their message on the need to regulate short-lived warming agents such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and black carbon is not new.
To some extent Molina and co-authors reiterate the call for early action that appeared in a Nature editorial back in July .
They, too, recommend that the Montreal Protocol be amended to include the phase-out of atmospheric HFCs, currently regulated under the Kyoto Protocol.
But they go further in their recommendations for dealing with black carbon, suggesting possible technologies to reduce its production from cooking stoves and diesel emissions, as well as feasible institutional and political arrangements to put these technologies in place.
In addition, they call for efforts to reduce pollutant gases such as methane and nitrous oxides that ultimately increase ozone - a significant greenhouse gas - in the lower atmosphere.
Regulating emissions from agriculture and transport would be crucial here.
Last on their wish list is more and better biosequestration - through means such as biochar - to give carbon sinks a much-needed boost.
As promised, Nature’s film on climate change went online last week on October 1.
You can view the film in full on nature.com (it lasts about twenty minutes in total).
It will also be on YouTube next week, at which stage I’ll embed it here.
The film was shot this July on location in Lindau at the 59th meeting of Nobel Laureates , and follows three young researchers – Brian Krohn, Faroha Liquat and Brandi Kiel Reese – on a journey to discover how their work on various aspects of chemistry can help solve the climate change problem.
Faroha Liquat, a PhD researcher based at Quaid-i-Azam University in Pakistan, is interested in devising novel ways to harness the power of the sun for the benefit of mankind.
She’s especially interested in developing cost-effective photovoltaic cells.
During the film, she has a very valuable interaction with the IPCC's Rajendra Pachauri on whether developing countries can prosper and be part of the climate change solution.
She’s currently visiting Pachauri’s institute, TERI, in Delhi .
During their week at Lindau, our young researchers hear about the changes already underway from climate experts, they challenge (and in some cases agree with) the views of political scientist Bjørn Lomborg, and they learn about the social responsibilities of scientists from the Nobel Laureates who first discovered the danger of CFCs.
Through these interactions, they explore the challenge of keeping global temperatures to within the 2 °C target.
Their take: we have the brains and the tools to solve this problem, we just need the political willpower.
Despite the expert nature of many of our interview subjects, the film provides a great overview of the climate change problem for anyone in need of an update in the run-up to Copenhagen.
Considered by some a silver bullet and by others a hopeless dream, the idea that we can simply capture our carbon dioxide emissions and store them safely away is nothing if not compelling.
After all, it lends an air of practicality to the notion that human ingenuity can somehow continue the unabated use of fossil fuels over the coming decades without dangerously warming the climate.
This week’s Science (subscription) looks at how close we are to being able to capture carbon dioxide, both from the point of emission at coal- or gas-burning power plants, and directly from air.
A series of news, opinion and review articles shows that while many obstacles need to be overcome before carbon capture and storage (CCS) is implemented effectively, there are also abundant reasons to hope that it will happen.
But the scale of the challenge is palpable.
In a review , Stuart Hazeldine of the University of Edinburgh, UK, says that the construction of many tens to hundreds of large CCS plants worldwide would be needed to reduce future worldwide emissions from energy by 20%.
And in order for the technology to make a substantial contribution to climate mitigation, a viable CCS industry needs to be in place between 2020 and 2030.
Construction would have to start now if plants fitted with CCS technology are to be operational by 2014, giving enough time to demonstrate commercial credibility by 2020.
Oxford economist Dieter Helm co-edits an upcoming book, The Economics and Politics of Climate Change , that he says takes "a colder and harder look at the challenge".
In a Q&A on Nature Reports Climate Change this week, Helm gives his take on a long-term strategy for reducing emissions.
Here's an excerpt:
Let's remember what lies behind Copenhagen.
The Kyoto Protocol measures countries' production of carbon, not consumption.
It's no accident the Europeans like Kyoto.
It's a set of measures which, as they de-industrialize and production moves to countries like China, makes them look good.
But the carbon consumption record of Europe, once you take those imports back, is pretty awful.
That's why Kyoto looks like a success, and yet it hasn't caused even a blip in the emissions path.
Do we also need to re-think climate economics?
What we have learnt is that politicians tend to choose the most expensive options first.
Faced with climate change, what's our solution?
In Europe, it's to devote most of our energies to a rapid build-out of wind power.
This is the sort of thing that makes nuclear power look cheap.
Climate change is about the massive increase of coal burning internationally, especially the growth of China and India fuelled by coal-based energy — and America too, where the Obama plans are also small relative to the problem.
These headlines make the report look like a Kurosawa film, but most of the actual stories are pretty accurate in my opinion.
The bottom line is that the Royal Society felt that the only sure way to save the planet is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
But in the event of a global climate emergency, we should at least know the consequences of geoengineering.
Rice paddies produce an estimated 20% of the methane released by human activities.
But according to data presented at a Beijing climate conference last week, a switch to certain farming practices could erase most of those emissions.
Jane Qiu reports on the research over at Nature News .
The catch?
Drained paddies emit more nitrous oxide, another potent greenhouse gas.
Still, the net effect is equivalent to taking 270 million tonnes of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere annually.
But outside China, mid-season drainage is not commonly practiced.
Low-hanging fruit, anyone?
International organizations are calling for fisheries to be included in a new global deal on climate change.
Earlier this week, a consortium of 16 organizations including the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Bank and the WorldFish Center issued a policy brief to delegates meeting in Bonn from June 1-12 for the latest round of UN climate talks.
Their key message was outlined in a Commentary by two of the authors of the brief published May 28 on Nature Reports Climate Change.
Nick Dulvy, Canadian Research Chair in Marine Biodiversity and Conservation at Simon Fraser University, Vancouver, and Eddie Allison, director of the WorldFish Center in Penang, Malaysia, argue that climate impacts represent a serious threat to those who depend on fisheries and aquaculture resources both for protein and as a source of income.
While agriculture and freshwater resources have featured prominently in climate policy discussions, the future of fisheries resources has been largely ignored, write Dulvy and Allison.
Yet, one third of the world's 6 billion people rely on fish and other aquatic products for at least one-fifth of their annual protein intake, and more than 36 million people worldwide are employed in the fisheries and aquaculture sector.
And with little ability to diversify to other modes of employment or to adapt to change, those in the developing world will be hardest hit as fish migration routes and spawning and feeding grounds change from those that fishers have learnt to harvest.
Fishing communities will also suffer indirectly as extreme events such as floods and hurricanes become more frequent.
The latest round of UN talks on climate change kicked off Monday in Bonn, where delegates will spend the next two weeks pouring over a draft negotiating text that contains various proposals for a new global climate deal.
But on one of the key issues – how much industrialized nations should reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in the short-term – nations remain at an impasse.
To agree a global deal in Copenhagen in December, it must be clear what reductions industrialised nations are aiming for by 2020 , says UN climate chief Yvo de Boer, who is leading the negotiations.
According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), developed countries would need to slash their emissions by 25-40% below 1990 levels by 2020 to constrain global warming to 2ºC.
If temperatures rise more than 2ºC above pre-industrial levels, dangerous climate impacts are highly probable.
Speaking at the St James’s Palace Nobel Laureates Symposium in London last week, US energy secretary and Nobel laureate Steven Chu implied that the US may, however, go further in its commitment to tackle climate change in Copenhagen.
“I hope we can deliver more than we've promised," said Chu.
"I have always liked to over-deliver on promises.
"
But according to Alistair Doyle reporting for Reuters , Washington clearly wants to see a greater effort overall from China.
In a defensive response, China’s climate ambassador has said that rich nations should focus on keeping pledges to curb greenhouse gases rather than place new demands on the poor.
Commercial ships steaming through international waters are pumping out increasing amounts of greenhouse gases that are out of the reach of the Kyoto Protocol and national regulatory schemes.
A new report from the UK parliament’s Environmental Audit Committee warns it could take years to bring these emissions under control.
The UN’s International Maritime Organisation - tasked under Kyoto with figuring out how to regulate emissions from shipping - has failed to move fast enough, says the report.
An IMO meeting on the issue held in October 2008 did not get as far as formulating a proposal that could be part of the negotiating text for a new global climate deal, now under discussion in Bonn.
There can be no excuse for the lack of progress within the International Maritime Organisation since the Kyoto protocol was signed.
That the IMO has yet to reach agreement even over the type of emissions control regime to take forward, let alone decide any details, suggests it is not fit for purpose in this vital area.
Russia has been a rather puzzling actor in the complicated diplomatic game which resulted in the Kyoto protocol, and which will be played out again in Copenhagen in December.
Climate warming doesn’t make headlines, and has so far not been a big concern, between Moscow and Vladivostok.
What prompted Russian leaders to ratify Kyoto was the prospect of making good money from emissions trading, rather than conviction that man-made climate change is a real phenomenon and a threat to society.
Now they have changed their minds.
In April, Vladimir Putin and his ministers approved a new climate ‘doctrine’ – well, that’s how they call these things in Moscow – which for the first time officially recognizes severe risks of global warming and calls for immediate action.
My story over at Nature News explains the nature and significance of the baffling doctrine, details of which are beginning to leak.
Critics point out that Russia plans to focus on adaptation to climate change, while putting less emphasis on actually reducing its emissions.
Others say Russia’s new climate policy has been quietly constructed behind closed doors, without any involvement from industry, NGOs and the public.
That’s all true; but Russia’s recognition of the scientific basis of climate change, and its apparent willingness to pro-actively partake in international climate protection efforts, outweighs these flaws.
Let’s see what Moscow will put on the table in Copenhagen.
Sure, all eyes in December will be on China, and Russia’s taciturn climate diplomacy has in the past been a fickle and half-hearted affair.
Even so, one must not under-estimate Moscow’s influence at international negotiation tables.
The climatic importance of Russia’s natural landscape, in particular its boreal forests and its permafrost soils, is beyond doubt anyway.
For example, huge amounts of old carbon that accumulated over thousands of years are stored in permafrost soils which occupy more than 60% of Russia’s 17 million square-kilometre land area.
How much of it will be released as the southern permafrost boundary shifts northwards as a result of climate warming, possibly by up to 100 kilometres in the next 20-25 years?
A paper in Nature this week suggests that, globally, permafrost thawing may lead to the release of an extra billion tonnes of carbon per year into the atmosphere.
The team measured carbon flows at a tundra site in Alaska where permafrost has been thawing for 20 years, and then calculated from the data the likely trajectory of global carbon release from thawing permafrost.
Here's an editor's summary .
Russian scientists were not involved in the study, led by Edward Schuur of the University of Florida in Gainesville.
That’s a pity.
If Moscow’s new interest in climate led to more frequent east-west collaborations in science, such as on permafrost, it would be a boon.
Sequestration of carbon dioxide, that is, pulling it out of the air and storing it where it cannot affect climate as a greenhouse gas, is a quest that engages many scientists and engineers.
Proposals have been made to store CO2 deep in the ocean and in depleted mines far underground.
Soon, though, you may be able to walk on sequestered CO2, says Sidney Omelon, a chemical and materials engineer with Calera Corporation, a California start-up.
The purpose of a project under study and described in Omelon’s Joint Assembly poster Tuesday is to capture CO2 from concentrated sources, such as emissions from power plants.
Step one is to channel the gas into an aqueous environment, in order to precipitate carbonate minerals.
The novel part is what happens next.
Calera is developing a process to incorporate this precipitate into the built environment, specifically in concrete used for street paving and buildings.
Cement, a key ingredient of concrete, is an ideal substance into which the precipitate can be added, Omelon said in an interview.
She does not know of any other comparable projects.
Surprisingly, in her view, it hasn’t been tried until now.
“Honestly, I can’t believe no one [else] thought of it first,” she said.
Calera is also looking into using captured CO2 in aggregate, another key component of concrete.
Even when concrete structures eventually crumble, the material itself would remain stable, Omelon said, and the CO2 would not escape to the atmosphere.
We are looking at CO2 as a resource, not just as a pollutant, Omelon concluded.
“I think if we just turn our brains to this, we can do some really useful things with carbonate minerals and also just try and reduce our general energy consumption, so that we don’t emit as much CO2.”
In April I reported that economic and political pressures were beginning to impact the UN carbon-credit programme that supports clean technology projects in the developing world, otherwise known as the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM).
The full story is also in the latest issue of Nature Reports Climate Change.
There has been quite some controversy over the total size of the Northern Hemisphere’s terrestrial carbon sink, so this first comprehensive estimate, published in Nature today , is filling a real gap.
Given China’s 1.2 billion population and rapidly growing economy, knowledge of how much of its emissions are actually staying in the atmosphere is pretty valuable information.
Globally, around 40% of annual emissions stay in the atmosphere; the rest is sequestered by plants, soils and oceans.
The Chinese data come at a time of growing speculation and guesswork over the People's Republic’s future climate and energy policies.
Needless to say, the study is of no small relevance with a view to upcoming climate negotiations.
The very fact that China’s land carbon sink is large is good news.
But the results will also strengthen the Chinese government’s negotiation position at the United Nations climate summit in December in Copenhagen.
This week’s UN hosted climate change talks in Bonn, Germany, are well underway.
According to New Scientist this climate summit is “more important than the G20”.
This meeting is the first of five sessions leading up to what the UN says will be an “ambitious and effective international climate change deal” to be finalised in Copenhagen in December ( pdf ).
The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has already started its ‘countdown to Copenhagen’ timer.
However, as Reuters pointed out on Wednesday, delegates from 175 nations even managed to argue about what they were arguing about.
The question is whether they should come up with a ‘treaty’, a ‘protocol’ an ‘agreement’, a ‘deal’, or a ‘decision’ to succeed the Kyoto protocol.
The Earth’s large forests take up substantially more atmospheric carbon dioxide through photosynthesis than they release back to the atmosphere through respiration.
Thus acting as a carbon ‘sink’, they (and the oceans) are our closest natural allies in the fight against climate change.
But many forests are at threat - not only from logging and clearing, but from climate change itself.
Take drought.
How will mature tropical rain forests respond to dryer conditions, which some climate models suggest might be ahead in the not-so-distant future?
The 2005 drought in the Amazon basin gave scientists an opportunity to find out.
What they saw is not particularly heartening: Prolonged dryness has apparently turned some affected areas of the Amazon from a carbon sink to a carbon source, a team led by Oliver Phillips of Leeds University in Britain reports in Science today (Abstract here ).
Patches subjected to a 100-milimetre decrease in rainfall released on average 5.3 tonnes of carbon per hectare – around 9 times the amount undisturbed tropical forests take up, on average, per year.
Basin-wide, between 1.2-1.6 billion tonnes of carbon were released during the 2005 drought, the team estimates.
Cutting down forests will add carbon to the atmosphere, no matter which kind of land cover replaces the jungle.
But what’s happening in tropical forests that have long been undisturbed by logging, storms or fire?
Theoretically, the carbon balance of such old-growth forest – if tree growth and death are in equilibrium, that is - should be next to zero.
But apparently it’s not.
In a paper in Nature today (subscription), a team led by Simon Lewis of Leeds University in Britain reports that tree biomass in intact African forests increased between 1968 and 2007.
Across 79 plots monitored in ten countries large living trees added an average 0.63 tonnes of carbon per hectare each year.
Scaled up to the continent, and including roots, smaller trees and dead wood, African forests seem to have stored 340 million tonnes of carbon per year during recent decades.
Previous studies suggested that Amazonian forests are accumulating biomass and carbon at a similar rate.
Globally, intact tropical forests seem to take up 1.3 billion tonnes of carbon per year – equivalent to almost 20% of annual carbon dioxide emissions worldwide.
Among the many proposed techno-fixes for climate change, ‘air capture’ seems like one of simplest solutions – what could be more straightforward than sucking greenhouse gases out of air and storing them somewhere else?
But various proposals for the direct removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere have largely been sidelined from serious discussions on climate control.
Noteworthy scientists and engineers – including those of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – have regarded the technology as a non-starter owing to the large amounts of energy involved.
After all, energy costs money and unless we find ourselves in ‘climate crisis’ mode, solutions to climate change will be considered on economic grounds as well as on efficacy.
But a new study by Roger Pielke, Jr. (of the University of Colorado and Prometheus blog) shows that air capture could be a cost-competitive mitigation option.
His analysis, soon to be published in Environmental Science and Policy [uncorrected proofs available from Pielke], compares the average costs of air capture over the 21st century to other mitigation options (namely international greenhouse gas regulation under the UN framework convention) assuming that technologies available today are used to fully offset net human emissions of carbon dioxide.
He runs the analysis for 3 different (and citable) estimates of the cost of air capture – $500, $360 and $100 per ton of carbon.
The IPCC estimate falls near the middle of this range.
For the two upper values, the cost of air capture would be comparable to the estimated cost of stabilizing atmospheric carbon dioxide at 450 ppm or 550 ppm given by Nick Stern in 2007 and by the IPCC in its last report.
But if the costs of air capture decrease to $100 per ton of carbon, then it would prove much more cost-effective than stabilizing at 450 ppm or 550 ppm.
We must therefore give air capture the same attention as other approaches to mitigation, argues Pielke, Jr.
The Indo-German LOHAFEX experiment in the Southern Ocean, suspended two weeks ago , can be conducted as planned.
Independent reviews sought by the German science ministry concluded that the experiment is in agreement with environmental standards and international law.
On Tuesday, the team on board the German Polarstern started dumping its cargo of 20 tonnes of iron sulphate.
The ship will stay around the area for around six weeks, giving the scientists’ enough time to observe the growth and decay of an ‘artificial’ algal bloom.
The CROZEX study was conducted in 2004 and 2005 near the Crozet archipelago at the northern boundary of the Southern Ocean.
Raymond Pollard of the National Oceanography Centre Southampton and his team found that natural iron fertilization, by dust supplied from the Crozet Islands, increases biological production and the amount of organic carbon taken down into the deep ocean.
That’s not particularly surprising.
But what’s amazing is this: The amount of carbon sequestered to 200 metres depth, while 18 times greater than that during an artificially induced bloom (like LOHAFEX), was a stunning 77 times smaller than the amount that had previously been determined during a natural bloom in the nearby Kerguelen region.
What’s more, carbon flux at 3,000 metres, where carbon dioxide sucked up at the surface would be safely locked away for centuries, was just 3% of that at 100 metres.
Check out this week's Nature podcast and the paper here (subscription)
“CROZEX carbon sequestration for a given iron supply (…) falls 15-20 times short of some geo-engineering estimates,” the authors conclude.
This, you’ve guessed it, has “significant implications for proposals to mitigate the effects of climate change through purposeful addition of iron the ocean.”
It has indeed.
The Nature news story here makes the point that the findings, if they hold up, could actually be the final blow to such proposals.
The notion that putting a little iron into the oceans here and there will suck up most of the surplus atmospheric carbon dioxide is pretty much dead, so it seems.
Alas, it was just too good to be true.
Stimulating algal growth by adding iron to nutrient-poor ocean regions is one of several geo-engineering methods that could possibly mitigate greenhouse warming.
But given widespread worries about possibly harmful side-effects on marine life, large-scale ocean ‘fertilization’ is currently not considered advisable.
The team on board the German ‘ Polarstern ’, who plan to spread 20 tonnes of iron sulphate over less than 20 by 20 kilometres-large patch of ocean surface in the Scotia Sea, hope that the study will provide new insight into how ocean ecosystems respond to fertilization – the very data, hence, that are needed to assess whether or not larger-scale future activities might be justified.
But opponents counter that such doing already qualifies as an activity banned by UN law.
Pressure groups have launched a signature campaign aimed at stopping the Polarstern crew, which will reach its destination by the end of the week, from dumping its load.
Collaboration requires communication, and communication is always better in person, but should climate researchers travel less?
Stohl has detailed the carbon emissions of scientists and non-scientists at his institute in a paper recently published in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics.
The emissions are certainly not jaw-dropping, but he raises a couple of interesting points.
For one, why is international collaboration between climate researchers—which usually requires some air travel— so strongly encouraged by funding agencies without an eye cast to how the hopping on planes might be minimised?
And to what extent is it for the climate change community to set an example to the rest of science—and to professionals of all stripes?
Yes, most researchers in the field care passionately that their work informs policies that changes people’s behaviour.
But only a quarter of attendees at the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry conference in September have sent back questionnaires about the fuel they burnt to get there.
Without more completed questionnaires, the organisers are having a tough time calculating the total carbon emissions, and thus how much they are aiming to off-set.
Though experts have pegged China as the world’s biggest carbon dioxide emitter for well over a year , it was only two weeks ago that the government first openly admitted China's emissions have caught up with the US (just barely, they insist).
This acknowledgment came the day after a senior Chinese climate policy official said rich nations should earmark a wopping 1% of their GDP to help the developing world tackle climate change.
Swift to follow was an international climate conference in Beijing , run jointly by China's government and the UN, which ambitiously proposed a new international agency to push technology transfer.
Jane Qiu reports the meeting’s outcome in Nature this week (subscription required).
In short, it’s not just the rather ghastly Christmas tree in my hairdresser’s window that’s signaling December is around the corner.
Next month ushers in the UN climate conference in Poznan, Poland , a major stop on the road between Bali and the Son of Kyoto treaty to be hammered out next year in Copenhagen.
The formerly reticent China seems to be after a louder voice at the table.
"There's growing external pressure on China and also its own problems with energy and the environment, and these factors are coming together to make it more active and focused on climate change," said Goerild Heggelund, an expert on Chinese climate change policy at the Fridtjof Nansen Institute in Norway.
President-elect Barack Obama's entry into the White House early next year, vowing greater action on climate change, will also lift expectations of China, said Guan Qingyou, a climate policy researcher at Tsinghua University in Beijing.
The 1% of GDP demanded last month, Qiu says, would cash out at US$284 billion - more than twice what the eight largest economies pledged to the climate-challenged developing world at July’s G8 summit .
Even if the North agreed to such a sum - or the 0.5% or 0.7% the Chinese have previously suggested - countries heading toward a global recession seem unlikely to improve on their poor records of delivering foreign aid.
Perhaps more UN-friendly is the new plan for stepping up the transfer of technologies that would allow the South to produce clean energy and adapt to unavoidable climate change.
Writes Qiu:
There is an emerging view among some experts that recoverable fossil-fuel reserves are far smaller than previously thought.
If so, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) highest emissions scenarios could be unrealistically high, thus limiting the worst-case climate change during the 21st century.
This view of a constrained fossil-fuel supply points to a potential convergence of thinking about policies and actions needed to address the seemingly divergent problems of energy supply and climate change.
Last month I wrote that geoengineering proposals had practically made the scientific mainstream, gracing a special issue of one of the Royal Society’s journals.
With global emissions steadily rising and policy responses slow to take hold, scientists have begun to call more loudly for research into the last-ditch technological fixes that might - or might not - be able to reset a rapidly changing climate.
Mentioned in the press release are some of the classics: reflecting sunlight with space-based mirrors, pumping cooling aerosols into the atmosphere, and fertilizing the ocean with iron to create carbon-sucking plankton blooms.
(Trials of that last one by startup company Climos, who hope to make carbon-credit money off it, are up for consideration by international regulators this week, Reuters reports .
) A working group will assess such ideas’ feasibility - “separate the science from the science fiction”, in the words of chair John Shepherd - as well as the huge side effects we could incur by trying to manually turn the thermostat on an incompletely understood planet.
A report will be out in mid-2009.
I wrote here yesterday that ‘I don’t think that anyone knows for sure how close we are to reaching tipping points in the climate system’.
As it so happens, a pair of articles published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences this week illustrates this point nicely.
The first is a Perspective by atmospheric scientist V Ramanathan and postdoctoral researcher Yan Feng from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, who argue that the Earth is now committed to a 2.4°C rise in temperature above pre-industrial levels.
Anything above a 2°C increase is generally considered to be ‘dangerous’ climate change and would likely trigger several of the Earth’s tipping points, such as the complete loss of Arctic summer sea ice and melting of the Greenland ice sheet.
And according to the IPCC, a rise in global temperature by 1-3°C will commit the planet to widespread loss of biodiversity, widespread deglaciation of the Greenland Ice Sheet, and a major reduction of area and volume of Hindu-Kush-Himalaya-Tibetan glaciers, which provide the head-waters for most major river systems of Asia.
The authors argue that for atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations to remain constant at 2005 levels for the rest of the century, aggressive emissions reductions would be required – yet emissions are rising .
Currently, the warming effect of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is being masked by the cooling effect of other air pollutants – such as smoke from cooking and agricultural waste burning – that create a dimming effect at the Earth’s surface.
Assuming policies to reduce these air pollutants are successful, the full warming potential of greenhouse gases will soon be realized.
So as air pollution measures become effective (and much headway is being made here), the need for reducing carbon dioxide emissions becomes even more urgent, say Ramanathan and Feng.
Although timidly questioned every so often, this apparently wrong postulate has prevailed for more than 30 years, leaving its mark in the Kyoto Protocol which excludes old-growth forests from national carbon budgets.
“Hence, 15 % of the global forest surface, which is currently not being considered for offsetting increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations, is responsible for at least 10% of the global net ecosystem production,” the authors write.
Obviously, the carbon sequestered in old forest was previously accounted for elsewhere.
Disturbingly, given that some offset profiteers praise tree planting as a panacea of sorts for climate change, young forests may actually be sources, rather than sinks, of CO2, if decomposition of soils and older vegetation preceded their creation.
Leaving intact and protecting old forests seems a far better option.
This insight comes rather late, but better late than never.
Oh, and it will really give climate negotiators something to think about.
There are plenty of ideas these days for purposefully messing with large-scale Earth systems in the hope of offsetting global warming.
The Phil Trans A articles don't catalogue them, though Stephen Schneider of Stanford touches on many in a great review article .
A pair of papers by the University of Edinburgh's Stephen Salter, NCAR's John Latham, and their colleagues discuss spraying micron-wide particles of sea water into the air to make clouds whiter so that they reflect more light.
Ocean fertilization is defended against 20 years of outcry by Victor Smetacek of the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research and Wajih Naqvi of the Indian National Institute of Oceanography.
And one from Philip Rasch of NCAR and co-authors deals with sulphate aerosols.
I was lucky enough to spend last weekend at t his year's SciFoo , and took in a number of sessions on climate and energy.
There was a lot of sometimes quite heated debate, but what was struck me most forcefully was the common ground that the optimists and pessimists share -- specifically, a belief that the challenge in front of us is utterly huge.
I almost said mind-numbingly huge, but people like Dan Schrag and Saul Griffith and Chris Uhlik have minds too active and well-exercised to numb easily...
“People are broadly concerned, but not entirely convinced”, concludes the l atest poll on public opinion of global warming by social marketing group Ipsos Mori.
Despite the deluge of media reports in the last year documenting the scientific consensus on climate change and the startling rapidity at which impacts are being seen around the world - most notably perhaps the ever-decreasing Arctic sea ice - 60% of the British Public is uncertain that climate change is caused by humans, and many others believe that scientists are overstating the problem.
There is growing concern that an economic depression and rising fuel and food prices are denting public interest in environmental issues.
Some environmentalists blame the public's doubts on last year's Channel 4 documentary The Great Global Warming Swindle, and on recent books, including one by Lord Lawson, the former Chancellor, that question the consensus on climate change.
The Great Global Warming Swindle resulted in a record 250 complaints to regulatory watchdog Ofcom (including the first ever peer reviewed complaint), but that’s still a fraction of the 2.5 million viewers.
Like many of those who saw the Channel 4 documentary, readers of Lawson’s offering on climate change ‘An Appeal to Reason’ are probably unaware it has been scientifically discredited in almost every review, including one on Nature Reports Climate Change by Sir John Houghton , Honorary Scientist at the UK’s Hadley Centre.
Promised as a "rare breath of intellectual rigour" and a "hard headed examination of the realities" of climate change, this offering is neither cool nor rational….and is largely one of misleading messages.
Lawson’s fundamental misunderstanding of basic scientific concepts is first displayed in his interpretation of the temperature records for the first part of this century, with which he attempts to discredit the science of climate change, and the work of many thousands of researchers who’ve dedicated entire careers to the problem.
More recently, he repeats this in an amusing attack on the recent Nature paper by NASA’s Cynthia Rosenzweig.
As Houghton rightly points out, Lawson is in need of climate science 101.
But then, it seems, he's not alone - at least on that count.
Don't grieve the Boxer-Lieberman-Warner climate bill , urges Joseph Romm in a Nature Reports Climate Change Commentary this week.
Romm, voice of the Climate Progress blog, writes:
Although hailed as landmark legislation, the proposal, which died after it failed to muster close to the required 60 votes [in the US Senate], would not have put the nation on the path required to help avert catastrophic climate change.
The bill, like most climate plans now up for serious debate around the world, relied heavily on imposing a financial penalty for carbon emissions.
But Europe's up-and-running emissions market has done little to curb the continent's appetite for carbon, and that should make legislators and negotiators queasy, argues Romm.
"The United States simply cannot wait another decade to find out whether domestic cap-and-trade legislation will drive carbon dioxide to a high enough price to curb emissions growth sharply," he says.
Nor is new technology the answer:
Romm said more about this Thursday in a cross-posted entry at Climate Progress and Grist , in the process resurrecting a set-to with Roger Pielke, Jr, on their respective blogs in April and May.
Development economist Jeffrey Sachs , famous for the economic turnarounds he's helped engineer as an advisor to Latin American and Eastern European governments, is also known for his optimism that the living standards of the world's poorest can be raised much higher without sacrificing either the wealth of the industrialized world or crucial natural resources.
But among analysts of global change, optimism is relative.
"I believe that there is most likely a path of sustainable development, but we can't quite be sure," Sachs told a sold-out lecture hall at the London Zoo last night.
"It's a question mark.
"
Sachs spoke on big themes from his new book Common Wealth: Economics for a Crowded Planet , notably the need for expansion beyond market-based thinking to face problems not dreamt of in Adam Smith's philosophy.
Before and after this rousing overview (if you'd bet ahead of time that Sachs would quote John F. Kennedy at length, you'd have won), I had the chance to get some nittier, grittier details on how Sachs wants to deal with climate change.
More and better government investment in foreign aid and green tech is the number-one key for Sachs - only the US presidential turnover seemed to run a close second, and cap-and-trading was off in the distance .
So he didn't hesitate to offer a laundry list of projects that he thinks need much more political commitment - among them carbon capture and storage , passively heated and cooled green buildings , and super duper climate computers .
Technological solutions often raise ownership problems, though.
If, for example, the agrobiotech industry produces new 'climate-proof' crop varieties that survive floods and droughts - an innovation Sachs welcomed at a recent climate modelling summit - can the developing world afford to buy the seeds?
In the case of African food shortages, he added, simple, readily available remedies like chemical fertilizers and high-yield non-GMO crops had been "sitting on the shelf" until the global food price crisis grabbed headlines.
We shouldn't have to wait for disasters before we take the equivalent action on climate change, he said.
Honoring commitments to monetary aid and technology transfer is the first step, he told me.
To get a global climate agreement out of the UN process, he also thinks we need to start by welcoming the economic growth of rapidly developing nations like China and India.
"That's the icebreaker on this first date," he said.
From that viewpoint, country-specific emissions targets can be set that correspond to growth along the greenest possible paths.
By 2050, he explained, that might mean that the North cuts its greenhouse emissions by 80% while India's emissions are allowed to double - a contraction-and-convergence plan.
Because China and India have even more to fear from climate change than does the wealthier world, he said, it's an ultimatum they'll have to accept: "You're going to develop.
But you're going to do it with the best technology.
"
For all tree huggers out there, this week’s Science is dedicated to ‘forests in flux’, paying tribute to the trees and their contribution to the greater good.
A special collection of articles in print, with complementary and online material, examines the fate of the world’s forests, in the face of climate change and an escalating human population.
Of particular relevance to discussions on how forests can mitigate global warming, Lera Miles and Valerie Kapos have a Perspective highlighting the risks involved in proposed schemes such as REDD (reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) and how to minimize them.
Also on this topic, Josep Canadell and Michael Raupach write on what science currently tells us is the best way to manage forests for sequestering carbon.
Drew Purves and Stephen Pacala discuss how forest dynamics remain one of the largest uncertainties in predicting future climate change and detail some of the efforts underway to improve their representation in models.
Or for a really solid review of how forests affect climate change, check out Gordan Bonan’s piece here .
Forests hold more than double the amount of carbon in the atmosphere.
Cutting global greenhouse emissions by half of 1990 levels by 2050 will not be sufficient to prevent major damage from climate change, say scientists in a Commentary published today on Nature Reports Climate Change.
This would still commit the world to substantial harm, even if it is “widely considered to be the most stringent politically achievable target”, says Martin Parry, who co-chaired the impacts assessment group for the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change, and others.
By analysing the regional and global impacts that would occur by 2050 and 2100 for various greenhouse gas emissions targets, Parry and co-authors argue that compared with 50 per cent cuts, slashing emissions by 80% below 1990 levels by mid-century would substantially reduce the damage caused; for example, halving the number at risk of water stress and flooding.
The current global food crisis should serve as a ‘wake-up call’ to G8 and UN leaders, they say, who suffer from “false optimism’ that “we can find a way to fully avoid all the serious threats of climate change”.
Declan Butler has a feature (subscription required) in this week's Nature on the potential of green architecture for mitigating climate change.
On his blog , he writes:
In Bangkok last week, the first UN climate meeting since Bali wrapped up after struggling til after midnight Friday - not to hammer out emissions targets or controversial new approaches to climate change mitigation, but just to agree on how long to wait before restarting discussions of such matters.
“The talks managed to keep the momentum going … but it’s hard to leave Bangkok confident that the deadline can be met,” said Elliot Diringer, director of international strategies at the Pew Center on Climate Change.
Marcelo Furtado of Greenpeace Brazil agreed , "If we took all these hours to agree on a workplan, one can only imagine what will happen when the real negotiations take place.
"
Why so slow?
For one thing, the G77 group of developing nations finally dug in their heels against Japan's week-long steady pressure to plan greenhouse gas limits for particular global industrial sectors, in addition to Kyoto-style national targets.
Sectoral approaches - heralded recently in Nature Reports Climate Change via this commentary by Glen Peters and Edgar Hertwich and this book review by Gwyn Prins - have the advantage of directly pushing the dirtiest industries to clean up, without leaving less carbon-stringent havens overseas for them to be pushed into.
They also distribute mitigation responsibilities to the developing as well as the developed world, something which the US has previously insisted on but which developing countries have warned they cannot afford without more help from the rich North.
By Friday, Japan met surprisingly fierce opposition to holding a workshop on sectoral approaches at the next climate conference, to be held in Bonn, Germany, in June.
G77 countries, including China , had been pointing to promises from Bali that rich countries would set new national targets and provide mitigation and adaptation funds enabling the South to share the burden of industrial emissions cuts.
After wrangling at length , they compromised on a sectoral workshop in August.
Today Australia sees the opening of the world's largest trial carbon storage plant ( Sydney Morning Herald , BBC , Reuters ), the construction of which was covered by Hannah Hoag in Nature Reports Climate Change last year.
Since then, soaring costs have prompted the US to junk plans for its FutureGen clean coal power plant, and the down-under demo project is the most massive noncommercial carbon burial site to make it off the drawing board (this Nature News feature rounds up the other contenders as of 2006; subscription required).
For background on how natural rock formations are being used to trap carbon dioxide - and why environmentalists have called the plant a waste of time and money - check out Hannah's report .
Reuters reported Friday that the long-awaited Montreal Climate Exchange will open on May 30, buying and selling voluntary emissions reductions in the same fashion as the Chicago Climate Exchange , its US partner.
But absolute emissions isn't what they'll limit - they're talking about regulating emissions intensity, or the amount of emissions per unit of production, from 2010.
That could make it tough to integrate into a global climate deal, since the EU caps absolute emissions and all three US presidential candidates want to do the same.
Interestingly, the plan also mandates carbon capture and storage for oil sands, a carbon-intensive economic lynchpin of the country.
Besides the voluntary market, local measures could already be in play when and if these limits come down.
British Columbia is leading the way with what is to be the first carbon tax implemented outside of Europe.
Although the tax hasn't been looking very popular and faces the same too-much-is-never-enough criticism that the EU climate bill came in for , liberal leader Stephane Dion now says he'd like the national strategy to be a carbon tax - or something.
Anything. "We can talk about what the best model for putting a price on carbon across Canada might be –– but the fact is we need to JUST DO IT.
That is what this provincial government has done, and that is what a Liberal government will do," Dion said in a speech in Vancouver.
Judging by the press coverage, it would appear that the Bush administration just turned green.
A flurry of stories has hit the press after James Connaughton, a senior environmental advisor, suggested the White House would be willing to “enter into an international agreement” on climate change, “if other countries do, too.” That’s according to the New York Times .
The BBC focused on three words - “binding international obligations” - uttered by Daniel Price, a national security advisor to President George W. Bush.
Although it remains unclear what, exactly, this means, it is perhaps telling that such statements could grab headlines around the world.
The administration seems eager to clarify what it considers misunderstandings about its position on global warming (namely the general perception that it will stop at nothing to quash or at least cripple any international treaty to protect its industry friends).
Bush’s critics aren’t going to buy it, of course, but they appear to be more than happy to watch the president try to wiggle out of what has become an increasingly lonesome political corner.
The problem here is that there isn’t much new.
In trying to explain the president’s call for “aspirational” climate goals last year, Connaughton used similarly vague language.
Under Bush’s plan, countries could institute various voluntary and regulatory measures at the national level.
Those commitments would become binding under an international treaty, he said.
If that were the case, this might be newsworthy.
But Connaughton’s suggestion that major developing nations (think China and India) would have to do the same is, if interpreted literally, a tad unrealistic.
It also goes against the administration’s entire strategy for global warming, which has up until this point emphasized a decentralized approach based on various national strategies that could be developed by countries according to their specific needs and resources.
Oddly enough, this is one area where the Bush administration’s arguments seemed to (quietly) resonate.
Following the principle of “common but differentiated” responsibilities for poor and wealthy nations, many in the climate community had already come to accept the idea that a one-size-fits-all approach simply would not work.
If, on the other hand, Connaughton meant to say that major developing nations could sign up for various national policies as opposed to strict emissions targets, the question is then whether the United States would be able to do the same thing.
If that were the case, nothing would have changed.
Where does all this leave us?
I’m not sure.
Connaughton says he is trying to reframe the administration’s position on climate change by emphasizing what it is willing to do, rather than what it is not willing to do.
If would be easier to evaluate if the administration would offer some numbers.
The European Commission's draft blueprint for tackling climate change, announced January 23rd, is praised in today's Nature editorial for hitting "the sweet spot" between politically pragmatic but shortsighted proposals and implausably idealistic ones.
Other groups - idealists and pragmatists alike - have reacted differently.
The Royal Society today released a report on the future of biofuels, which have recently been the subject of intense debate, as Kurt Kleiner reported in Nature Reports Climate Change last month .
New UK rules to begin this April require transport fuel suppliers to include a small percentage of 'renewable fuel' in their fuel sales, working up to 5% by 2010.
But according to the Royal Society report, this policy intiative (called the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation or RTFO ) is not guaranteed to meet its climate-preserving goals.
When it comes to lowering greenhouse gas emissions, the report points out, there are biofuels and biofuels.
That is, while some plant fuel sources promise as much as 80% greenhouse gas savings over fossil fuels, it's also possible to keep trashing the planet by using unsustainable methods to produce and supply renewable fuels.
Unless the UK sets emissions targets per se in its fuel policy, warns the report, the new UK rules and the EU Biofuels Directive that they reflect "will do more for economic development and energy security than combating climate change".
How expensive is climate change, what's the cost of stopping it, and should we pay now or pay later?
Scientific American gets a three-sided look at these questions in side-by-side interviews with Nicholas Stern , Bjorn Lomborg and Gary Yohe .
There's an interesting commenary in Nature this week (currently free to access) by Steve Rayner of the James Martin Institute in Oxford and Gwyn Prins of the LSE , arguing that while emissions abatement is a global priority, the Kyoto Protocol is the wrong tool for the job -- a one-size-fits-all approach that, among other failings, doesn't actually look likely to deliver the reductions that it has promised.
Unfortunately, as they argue, this sub-optimal approach has developed an iconic status of its own, so that in many minds to be against Kyoto is tantamount to being against any form of action on climate.
They're worried that this means people will uncritically attempt to follow up the Kyoto protocol (which expires in 2012) with a son-of-Kyoto that contains many or all of the same flaws, when they should be having a much more radical rethink.
The Kyoto Protocol is a symbolically important expression of governments' concern about climate change.
But as an instrument for achieving emissions reductions, it has failed.
It has produced no demonstrable reductions in emissions or even in anticipated emissions growth.
And it pays no more than token attention to the needs of societies to adapt to existing climate change.
The impending United Nations Climate Change Conference being held in Bali in December — to decide international policy after 2012 — needs to radically rethink climate policy...Already, in the post-Kyoto discussions, we are witnessing that well-documented human response to failure, especially where political or emotional capital is involved, which is to insist on more of what is not working: in this case more stringent targets and timetables, involving more countries.
The next round of negotiations needs to open up new approaches, not to close them down as Kyoto did.
In Correspondence in this week's Nature , John Shepherd from the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton and colleagues challenge the scheme proposed by James Lovelock and Chris Rapley to help the planet cure itself from the disease of global warming.
For those of you who missed it, a couple of weeks ago, Lovelock and Rapley put forward a geo-engineering solution to climate change in Nature, which involves the installation of large vertical pipes in the ocean that would pump nutrient-rich water from depth to the surface.
This, they said, would enhance the growth of algae in the upper ocean, which in turn would transport more carbon to the deep sea.
Now, Shepherd and colleagues claim that the proposed scheme is based on false assumptions.
They say the scheme would not lead to enhanced storage of carbon in the deep ocean below 1,000m and in deep ocean sediments, which is necessary for effective long term removal of carbon from the atmosphere.
Instead, they maintain the scheme could actually worsen global warming by bringing high levels of particulate carbon back to the surface, where it could be released to the atmosphere.
The authors also argue that such large scale engineering solutions could harm fragile ecosystems.
In a Correspondence in this week's Nature , James Lovelock and Chris Rapley propose a way of stimulating the Earth to cure itself from the disease of global warming.
They turn to the ocean for solutions.
Their proposed scheme involves placing vertical pipes some 200 meters long in the sea to pump nutrient-rich water from depth to the surface, thus enhancing the growth of algae in the upper ocean.
The algae, which are key in transporting carbon dioxide to the deep sea and producing dimethyl sulphide involved in the formation of sunlight-reflecting clouds, should help to prevent further warming.
Lovelock and Rapley admit that the scheme may fail or impact the ocean in negative ways, such as through further acidification (which is recognized a significant threat to marine life and water quality ) but they argue that the stakes are so high now that we can’t afford not to try such a solution.
On the BBC Today program this morning the head of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Yvo de Boer
The UN's binding global climate agreement, the Kyoto Protocol, currently requires industrialised nations to reduce the majority of emissions themselves.
3.
Given the long residence time of atmospheric carbon dioxide, concentrations cannot be stabilized if developed countries do not reduce emissions by a great deal.
Solutions to climate change could come in extremely small sizes, according to a report released last week by the UK Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA).
“Environmentally Beneficial Nanotechnologies: Barriers and Opportunities” explores the application of nanoscience in five key areas that could reduce greenhouse gas emissions, namely: insulation, photovoltaics, electricity storage, engine efficiency and the hydrogen economy.
The report suggests that applying nanotechnology in these five key areas could contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by up to 2 % in the short term and up to 20 % by 2050 with similar reductions in air pollution.
Nanotech innovations could also provide a solution to reducing cost and increasing efficiency of solar cells.
The report says this is unlikely to result in significant GHG emission reduction in the UK, where there is relatively little sun, but could be of significance to reducing global emissions.
Jonathan Kohler at the Department of Land Economy, University of Cambridge, however, believes that photovoltaics can have a significant output even in British climatic conditions.
If the cost was reduced through advances in nanotechnology, we could see the large scale application of photovoltaics in the UK in the next twenty years, he says.
A nanotech application with clear benefits for a country like the UK where 50% of energy demand is domestic would be the development of effective insulation for solid walled buildings.
As a branch of science in its infancy, significant peer-reviewed research in this area is yet to come – as a result the latest IPCC WGIII report on mitigating climate change doesn’t consider nanotech solutions to climate change.
Aside from the funding and research required to develop these concepts, there are specific concerns that need to be addressed such as the potential toxicity of newly developed materials and the need to allay public fears that the materials could behave both strangely…and unpredictably.
Warnings that switching to biofuels as a ‘clean’ energy source could threaten food security and increase deforestation have become increasingly stark this week.
Today, BBC News reports on new study by the UK based Co-op Insurance Society that reiterates some of these concerns.
The CIS report warns of the potentially severe environmental impacts of increased biofuel production.
According to the BBC, the study found that as much as nine per cent of the world's agricultural land could be needed to replace just 10% of the world's transport fuels.
The land needed for energy crops could encroach on what little land is available for food in countries threatened by famine.
The conference was opened by Tim "Weather Maker" Flannery , which is a pretty big name for a new field to manage to attract, I'd have thought.
Here's an overview of the conference by Kelpie Wilson of the Energy Bulletin .
One interesting aspect is the idea of tying this issue to the issue of crappy stoves that drive indoor air pollution and waste a lot of energy.
As I mentioned we've a look at the subject in Nature this week, too -- a commentary ( pdf ) from one of the field's main men, Johannes Lehmann of Cornell, which takes things forward nicely, I think.
One of the advantages he points out for biochar sequestration -- as opposed, say, to sequestration of carbon in aquifers -- is that once the carbon is in the soil "it is difficult to imagine any incident or change in practise that would cause a sudden loss of stored carbon".
And he also argues that this sort of practise could be carried out at a serious scale:
I have calculated emissions reductions for three separate biochar approaches that can each sequester about 10% of the annual US fossil-fuel emissions (1.6 billion tonnes of carbon in 2005).
First, pyrolysis of forest residues (assuming 3.5 tonnes biomass per hectare per year) from 200 million hectares of US forests that are used for timber production; second, pyrolysis of fast-growing vegetation (20 tonnes biomass per hectare per year) grown on 30 million hectares of idle US cropland for this purpose; third, pyrolysis of crop residues (5.5 tonnes biomass per hectare per year) for 120 million hectares of harvested US cropland.
In each case, the biochar generated by pyrolysis is returned to the soil and not burned to offset fossil-fuel use.
Even greater emissions reductions are possible if pyrolysis gases are captured for bioenergy production.
Cities play key and diverse roles in the climate change arena.
Regarding mitigation, a high proportion of energy, industrial and transportation emissions is generated by urban areas.
Although most of the electricity and fuels are produced outside cities, they are aimed at satisfying cities’ “thirst” of energy.
Therefore, urban areas place a huge burden not only on the absorptive capacity of the local environment; they also influence wide patterns of energy and land use in the surrounding and more distant areas, in the livelihoods and quality of life of people living outside cities’ boundaries.
As of vulnerability and adaptation, urban centers concentrate a large proportion of coastal and other populations most at risk from the effects of climate change (IPCC Summary for Policy Makers).
The need for urban and local authorities and civil groups to develop actions to reduce greenhouse gases is part of the agenda of several cities in United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America (www.iclei.org).
Yet, the need to act to increase cities’ capacity to adapt to climate change and to understand the mechanisms to increase their resilience is not so well established, especially in developing countries.
The irony here is that many of the urban areas more vulnerable to the negative impacts of climate change are those with almost negligible contributions to the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
For instance, each citizen of Los Angeles emits an average of 15.6 tons CO2 e. These amounts are huge when compared to amounts in Mexico City, where each inhabitant releases four times less than in Los Angeles (3.6 tons CO2 e).
If we multiply the per capita numbers by the total population, then Los Angeles and Mexico City emit 234 and 64.8 million Tons per year respectively (See footnote 1).
At the same time, cities are centers of diverse kinds of innovations (including technological innovation) that may contribute to de-carbonizing our societies and making them more sustainable and resilient.
Only through the transformation of the infrastructure, especially transport, and the use of power in cities’ buildings, in the behavior, and in the production and consumption patterns of their residents, will it be possible to reduce greenhouse gases.
Furthermore, urban centers might cope with the impacts of climate related events by introducing changes in the availability of water and other natural resources, in environmental conditions, and in buildings characteristics.
There are examples of well governed cities, which have introduced actions to ensure the provision of infrastructure and services, and urban planning and management that reduces the vulnerability of people, industries and infrastructures.
Yet, those cases are exceptional, and adaptation practices which increase cities’ resilience are taking place on a very limited basis (IPCC Summary for Policy Makers).
Hunt, J.
(2004), “How can cities mitigate and adapt to climate change?, Building, research and information 32(1), p.55
With the IPCC reporting that greenhouse gas concentrations can be stabilized at an extremely small cost relative to global GDP, why should advocacy press right up to the scientific frontier where claims are most vigorously contested and knowledge most uncertain?
The case for mitigation is already strong without invoking hurricane damages.
And consider this: even if we simply assume that greenhouse gases have a large and immediate impact on hurricane intensities, there is little that mitigation efforts can do anyway to stem the ever-growing economic toll associated with hurricanes.

Willis's research arm funded the work, along with the offshore oil industry, the US Department of Energy and the US National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), where Holland is based.
They all want to know how climate change will alter hurricane patterns in the Atlantic.
At the request of several US state governors, the project is also looking at rainfall over the Rockies and winds in the Great Plains.
Says Holland:
I'm not going to forecast a squall line through New York in 2050.
But what we want to do is be able to say: "What are the statistics of squall lines going through New York in 2050?
" or "What are the statistics of hurricanes coming into Miami in 2050?
"
With a month to go until its official finish, the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season has seen more damage, as measured in dollars, than any other year except the monster 2005 season.
Scientists have yet to agree whether human-induced climate change has caused spiking Atlantic hurricane activity since the early 1990s - and while the season has raged on, researchers have continued to go back and forth on whether worse is in store as the ocean keeps warming.
Science this week has the latest salvo in the longtime debate: a Perspective (subscription) by Gabriel Vecchi of NOAA, Kyle Swanson of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, and Brian Soden of the University of Miami.
Warming sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the Atlantic, thought to fuel hurricanes, are correlated with the recent surge in storm activity.
The trend is roughly linear, note Vecchi et al., and extending it along with predicted temperature rises implies that by 2100, a hurricane season like 2005’s might be considered mild.
But that’s only true, they caution, when you look at absolute temperatures.
Relative warming - the Atlantic heating up even more than other tropical seas - is equally well-correlated.
Citing their recent papers in Nature and Geochemistry, Geophysics and Geosystems , and Knutson et al.
in Nature Geoscience , the authors make an argument that relative warming is more likely to be the true cause of increasing activity.
And relative warming of the Atlantic sea surface, in contrast to absolute warming, doesn’t keep trending upwards in 21st-century climate predictions.
Cyclones appear to be responsible for a large amount of organic carbon tied up in ocean sediments.
In a paper published in Nature Geoscience, Robert Hilton and colleagues report on the impact of cyclone-induced floods on carbon in the LiWu River in Taiwan.
They found that between 77 and 92% of non-fossil carbon eroded from the LiWu catchment area was moved during floods linked to cyclones.
As increased sea surface temperatures from global warming could increase the intensity of cyclones, this could create negative feedback, with bigger cyclones locking up more organic carbon in sediments.
Sadly this is not going to stop global warming.
Hurricanes may become rarer in the Atlantic throughout the 21st century if the world continues to warm, suggests a new study.
The research is the latest to address the question of how – and whether - global warming will affect the intensity and frequency of hurricanes.
Globally, the number of major hurricanes has shot up by 75% since 1970.
And although rising ocean temperatures are generally accepted as the key culprit – hurricanes can only form where sea surface temperatures exceed 26ºC - the link to global warming has remained a contentious issue.
In the new study , published online yesterday in Nature Geoscience [subscription], Thomas Knutson of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and colleagues showed, using a regional climate model of the Atlantic basin, that the trend in increased hurricane activity in the Atlantic over the past 25 years will not continue into the future, though hurricanes in the area may become more intense and associated with heavier rainfall.
Though they use a different model, the results generally concur with the recent paper by hurricane specialist Kerry Emanuel , which shows that hurricanes are likely to decrease in frequency but increase in intensity in certain locations as temperatures rise.
The situation on how hurricanes have changed and will likely change in the future are outlined in my recent Scientific American article, but may seem as murky as ever to the public although clarity is actually emerging.
A recent news report in the Press Register outlines some sources of confusion related to just how well the past record is known.
It cites work by Landsea that relied on numbers of land-falling storms as a way to calibrate the Atlantic hurricane record, and which concluded that there may be an undercount of 3.2 storms per year prior to 1966.
The most recent Eos Transactions has two articles that follow up and point out why use of land-falling storms is misleading [ Holland 2007; Eos 88 (36) 348-349 ] and that the conclusions of increased activity do not change anyway [ Mann et al., 2007; Eos 88 (36) 349-350 ].
The Holland article points out that there are good reasons why the fraction of storms making landfall should change, both because of natural variations and especially if the climate changes.
The Mann et al.
article adopts the Landsea-suggested changes for the past as a “what if” test and goes on to show that even a substantial underestimate of early 20th century storms does not change the significance of the increase in activity since 1994.
Nor does it change the strong relationship with observed sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the region; the SSTs have a much more reliable observational record and have clearly increased.
Surprisingly, none of these studies refers to what seems to me to be the most definitive analysis of the likely missed storms in the historical counts by Chang and Guo (2007) in which they analyze in detail the actual ship tracks in the past compared with modern tropical storm tracks.
To quote their main conclusions: “It is estimated that the number of tropical cyclones not making landfall over any continent or the Caribbean may have been underestimated by up to 2.1 per year during 1904–1913, with this number decreasing to 1.0 per year or less during the 1920s and later decades.
Our results suggest that the characteristics of North Atlantic tropical cyclone track statistics might have changed during the 20th century.”
In 2007 the tropical storm season has been fairly normal in many respects up to now.
Only 3 hurricanes have been recorded (versus average 3 to 4) but two were category 5 storms, and that is highly unusual.
Forecasts of hurricane activity by NOAA and Bill Gray continue to forecast substantially above normal activity in the Atlantic.
To me, observing the events thus far, the incredibly intense convective activity in the Indian Ocean from May to July was an important and totally overlooked factor.
The subsequent heavy rains and flooding in India and China were no doubt related.
The fact that Atlantic hurricane activity is influenced by events in the Indian Ocean seems to be overlooked by the hurricane forecasters.
A recent paper published by Gaertner et al.
in Geophysical Research Letters (GRL) (in press as of 12 July 2007) explores the possibility for tropical cyclones to occur in the Mediterranean area in the future with global warming.
It has been featured in the Times .
The paper correctly points out that tropical cyclones have recently ventured into some unusual places with Catarina on the east coast of Brazil in March 2004 and Vince making landfall in Spain in 2005.
Gaertner et al.
use an ensemble of regional climate models to assess new locations of tropical cyclone occurrence.
They find an increase in extremes of cyclone intensity over the Mediterranean Sea in regional model climate change scenario simulations.
This increase, they claim, is clearly related to tropical cyclone formation, revealing for the first time a risk of tropical cyclone development over the Mediterranean Sea under future climate change conditions.
The regional model framework for this study is one limitation as it may not create the correct large-scale atmospheric circulation across the region.
In particular, the Mediterranean climate in summer is one of clear skies and sunny days associated with the overall global monsoon circulation, such that the upward motion and rains in southern Asia are linked to the subsiding air over the Mediterranean that makes for a very stable environment unfavorable for storms.
Unless that link is properly simulated (and it may not be, especially in a regional model) the vertical atmospheric temperature and wind structure are unlikely to be right.
The authors are aware of the summer difficulties and so they choose September as the time for the simulations.
This has the advantage that the sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are highest then.
The sun has been beating down all summer, but it tends to form a shallow layer of warm water and whether there is adequate heat below the surface is also a critical question.
As cyclones form they churn up the ocean, bringing cold waters up from below and cool the ocean, creating a cold wake.
In this work the SSTs were specified and fixed and this was not allowed to happen.
Moreover, by September, the mid-latitude westerlies have set in and the winds in the upper troposphere are typically over 20 m/s, so the wind shear environment is generally unfavorable for such storms.
It is possible that the weather could change enough to relax the winds for just long enough to open a window for tropical cyclones but the odds are not high.
This is the extratropics, after all.
All these questions remain.
Nonetheless, with higher SSTs it does seem likely that cyclones would be more vigorous.
But whether they are truly tropical or not is a key issue.
The paper does not comment on water vapor: the Mediterranean Sea is surrounded by land where the air is drier and this can cause storms to run out of moisture and peter out.
Nor does it mention rainfalls and flooding: a chief characteristic of tropical cyclones is the heavy rainfalls of several mm per hour.
Nonetheless, warm core storms have been noted in the Mediterranean and are colloquially referred to as “Medicanes”.
June 1 is almost here, and for residents of the eastern US, Caribbean and Central America that means just one thing: stock up on the plywood and batten down the hatches, for the Atlantic hurricane season is upon us.
This week’s Nature features a minor rush of hurricane-related items.
First off, in a technical manuscript , Ryan Sriver and Matthew Huber of Purdue University spell out how tropical cyclones could play a significant role in mixing the ocean’s topmost layers.
They find that about 15 percent of the peak ocean heat transport can be linked to the ocean mixing caused by cyclones.
Kerry Emanuel of MIT has had much the same idea before, but the Purdue work extends and better quantifies the role of hurricanes.
It’s an interesting study that turns some conventional wisdom on its head: instead of worrying about how climate change affects hurricanes, maybe we should be worrying instead about how hurricanes affect climate change.
Quirin Schiermeier, our correspondent in Munich, has a longer news feature on this, plus more on ocean mixing in general.
(See also Martin Visbeck’s essay on ocean mixing from last week).
I've got a short news story previewing the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season.
The National Hurricane Center in Miami has put out almost exactly the same forecast as last year, calling for an above-average number of storms.
The 2006 predictions didn’t pan out so well – blame a late summer El Nino that surged unexpectedly, quashing the number of expected hurricanes.
This year, forecasters don’t expect that to happen – and in fact anticipate a weak La Nina, the opposite weather pattern that should permit more hurricanes to form.
In other words, buckle up.
One of the interesting things about this year’s season is that there is a new director for the hurricane center.
This is a very big and high-profile job in the US; the center director serves as a public face for warning of dangerous storms, including trying to get people to evacuate when necessary.
The previous director, Max Mayfield, was well liked by nearly everyone (even if New Orleans officials didn’t listen to his warnings as much as perhaps they should have as Hurricane Katrina approached the city in August 2005).
Now the hot seat belongs to Bill Proenza, a former director of the southern region of the National Weather Service.
He’s a frequent and outspoken critic of his bosses, and this month has been complaining that his center doesn’t get enough money for forecasting.
He may be right, but the Atlantic is by far the best-funded and best-studied of all the world’s hurricane regions.
Let us not forget the Pacific or the Indian oceans, which get hammered regularly without the benefit of a highly regarded, highly publicized hurricane center to spread warnings.
If you want to stay up to date as the hurricane season progresses, I recommend checking out the Florida newspapers.
The Miami Herald and the St. Petersburg Times are particularly good sources of local information.
For more of an overview, check out this week’s New York Times science section , which has a pair of lead stories devoted to hurricanes; John Schwartz, a technology reporter who covered much of the Katrina failure, has a piece on how engineers try to outwit the storms through construction.
And Cornelia Dean, who has long covered coastal development issues, has a good overview on the ongoing debates over the potential links between climate change and hurricanes.
Here at Nature, we too will do our part to keep you involved and informed.
Complementing our existing coverage online and in print, Nature Reports Climate Change , NPG's dedicated climate change website will be launching next week - check in with us for updated coverage as the season gets underway.

April this year was the hottest on record, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has announced.
NOAA also says that Arctic sea ice was “below normal for the 11th consecutive April” while “based on NOAA satellite observations, snow cover extent was the fourth-lowest on record” since 1967.
The collapse of UN-led international efforts to combat climate change means a new approach that is “politically attractive and relentlessly pragmatic” is required, according to a new report.
The 14 authors of a new report on climate policy describe themselves as “an eclectic group of academics, analysts and energy policy advocates”.
They say the Kyoto Protocol style approach “crashed” last year with the perceived failure of the Copenhagen meeting.
“To reframe the climate issue around matters of human dignity is not just noble or necessary.
It is also likely to be more effective than the approach of framing around human sinfulness –which has failed and will continue to fail,” write the authors , including Gwyn Prins, of the London School of Economics; Roger Pielke Jr, of the University of Colorado; and Hiroyuki Tezuka, who represented the Japan Iron and Steel Federation.
A new approach should focus on three objectives, says the paper, ensuring energy access for all, developing in a way that does not undermine Earth systems, and ensuring societies can withstand all climate vagaries, “whatever their cause may be”.
The Hartwell group argues that the inclusive approach of previous attempts to reach a global climate consensus needs to be broken up, with forests, biodiversity, air quality and other issues put back into silos and made to “again stand on their own”.
Their paper also suggests that an almost exclusive focus on carbon dioxide is unwise, and there should be more action on other greenhouse agents, such as black carbon and tropospheric ozone.
Bill Hare, of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, told the BBC , he did not buy this.
“The paper’s focus away from CO2 is misguided, short-sighted and probably wrong,” says Hare.
“If you take action on black carbon and do not reduce CO2 emissions then you may end up with more warming in the long term.”
Hare also says that the Kyoto Protocol is “one of the few things that have worked” and he questions the Hartwell group's acceptance of industry funding.
Over 250 members of the US National Academy of Sciences have hit back at global warming deniers, warning that attacks on climate science are being mainly driven not by intellectual inquiry but by special interest and dogma.
In a letter published in Science the researchers compare the recent furore around the so-called ‘climate-gate’ stolen emails to the Communist witch hunts of the 50s led by Joseph McCarthy
“We urge our policy-makers and the public to move forward immediately to address the causes of climate change, including the un-restrained burning of fossil fuels,” they write ( letter , open access version ).
“We also call for an end to McCarthy-like threats of criminal prosecution against our colleagues based on innuendo and guilt by association, the harassment of scientists by politicians seeking distractions to avoid taking action, and the outright lies being spread about them.”
After a vast cache of emails between climate researchers were stolen from the University of East Anglia and leaked online, a number of people sceptical of climate change declared that these messages proved man-made global warming was a myth.
US Senator James Inhofe even implied criminal charges could be forthcoming against the scientists involved.
The new letter says such political attacks on climate scientists are deeply disturbing.
It sets out a series of ‘theories’ such as the age of the Earth being 4.5 billion years, the Big Bang and evolution that are “overwhelmingly accepted”, even though researchers are very willing to be shown these are wrong.
Climate science, say the signatories, now falls into this category.
Peter Gleick, president of the Pacific Institute and corresponding author of the letter, writes, “In the end, we have only three choices: we can act to mitigate the risks of climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, we can expand efforts to adapt to a changing climate, or we can suffer the consequences of doing nothing.
The only real question is, what is the balance among these three options.” ( Huffington Post .
)
“The scientific community must recognize that the recent attacks stem in part from its culture and scientists’ behaviour,” he writes.
“In turn, it is time to focus on the main problem: The IPCC reports have underestimated the pace of climate change while overestimating societies’ abilities to curb greenhouse gas emissions.”
Douglas Keenan, an independent researcher, has been attempting to get Queen’s University Belfast (QUB) to give him data including the width of rings and the location of trees used by its climate researchers (see: Keenan’s website ).
The university refused and Keenan appealed to the Information Commissioner (see: Climate researcher vs FOI, part two , Nature).
“This has taken three years, but it is worth it,” said Keenan in an email.
“It is an important victory for FoI [Freedom of Information] on research data.
Also, for global warming studies, the data is extremely valuable for reconstructing temperatures over past millennia.
"
The integrity of research by the ‘climate-gate’ scientists has been upheld by the latest report into the email theft affair, despite the inquiry team expressing surprise that few professional statisticians were involved in work that is “fundamentally statistical”.
This inquiry, headed by Ron Oxburgh, is one of a number into the aftermath of emails leaked from the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia.
It was established to consider allegations that papers emanating from CRU had manipulated data dishonestly to support pre-determined conclusions on climate change.
“We saw no evidence of any deliberate scientific malpractice in any of the work of the Climatic Research Unit and had it been there we believe that it is likely that we would have detected it,” says the Oxburgh report .
“Rather we found a small group of dedicated if slightly disorganised researchers who were ill-prepared for being the focus of public attention.”
This report reviewed 11 publications considered to be representative of the CRU’s output (including two papers published in Nature).
These cover direct temperature observations and the tree ring work that has caused many climate change sceptics to get so hot under the collar.
Oxburgh’s panel has already been attacked by some over perceived conflicts of interest – such as its chair also being honorary president of the Carbon Capture and Storage Association.
The other inquiries into the email theft and subsequent ‘climate-gate’ furore have also been attacked on similar grounds.
Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change, said in a statement, “The panel has carried out a thorough investigation of the evidence, and anybody who simply rejects these findings will show that they are motivated by prejudice and ideology rather than by scepticism and a desire to uncover the truth.
I think those so-called sceptics and commentators in the media who have attempted to undermine the credibility of climate change science on the basis of the hacked e-mails now need to apologise for misleading the public about their significance.”
The scientist at the centre of the ‘climate-gate’ emails has escaped censure from a Parliamentary inquiry into the affair, but his university and the field of climate science in general have not.
“Climate science is a matter of global importance.
The quality of the science therefore has to be irreproachable,” says Phil Willis, chair of Parliament’s Science and Technology Select Committee.
“What this inquiry revealed was that climate scientists need to take steps to make available all the data that support their work and full methodological workings, including their computer codes.
Had both been available, many of the problems at [the University of East Anglia’s Climatic Research Unit] could have been avoided.”
Some have used emails purloined from the Climatic Research Unit to allege impropriety on the part of unit head Phil Jones and other researchers.
But the select committee says in its report that Jones's actions were “in line with common practice in the climate science community”.
The committee also criticises climate science in general, and calls for the field to be more transparent and to release both the raw data and the computer codes use in research:
...the practices and methods of climate science are a key issue.
If the practices of CRU are found to be in line with the rest of climate science, the question would arise whether climate science methods of operation need to change.
In this event we would recommend that the scientific community should consider changing those practices to ensure greater transparency.
The University of East Anglia has announced details of the team that will be looking into the scientific papers produced by its Climatic Research Unit, following last year’s email theft and subsequent controversy.
Furious rows ensured after emails from the CRU published on the internet were taken by some as showing that Global Warming was a huge conspiracy.
A number of inquiries have followed.
This particular inquiry is investigating the scientific publications of the CRU, which have been questioned by a number of climate sceptics as some of the emails published contained statements that they took to indicate manipulation of data*.
“The shadow hanging over climate change and science more generally at present makes it a matter of urgency that we get on with this assessment,” says Lord Oxburgh, the former chair of the House of Lords Select Committee on Science and Technology, who has been selected to head this inquiry ( press release ).
Lord Oxburgh’s panel will join another UEA inquiry looking into allegations of poor scientific practice.
There is also a House of Commons select committee inquiry into the ‘climate-gate’ email incident.
It’s been a busy week for climate change watchers.
We had the British parliamentary hearing into climate-gate, the IPCC announced it was reviewing its procedures, American politician James Inhofe waded in with his own report, and then there was the usual plethora of yes-it-is, no-its-not back and forth.
Written evidence from the Institute of Physics to the parliamentary inquiry is critical of the scientist at the centre of the affair – Phil Jones of the Climatic Research Unit (CRU).
Some have taken it as casting doubt on global warming.
Senator James Inhofe has launched a report – and another attack on climate science.
“In our view, the CRU documents and emails reveal, among other things, unethical and potentially illegal behaviour by some of the world’s pre-eminent climate scientists.”
Another day, another fault discovered in the climate change catechism?
This time it’s not the usual suspects claiming a grand global conspiracy though.
It’s a bit more interesting than that.
The story has been picked up by the Times , which opines that “although the errors do not alter the bigger picture on climate change, they have been seized upon as a further sign that scientific institutions have not been sufficiently transparent”.
For their part, the Met Office says it is grateful to the computer expert for catching their mistake and actually this shows how open they are already being.
“We have put an exhaustive amount of information out there to show people exactly what we do,” says Peter Stott, head of climate monitoring and attribution at the Met Office, in the Times.
Graham-Cumming is not a climate sceptic, he tells the Times, “but this does show why the raw data and not just the results should be available”.
Nature’s editor in chief has stepped down from the Russell Review inquiry into aspects of the ‘climate-gate’ emails, just hours after the inquiry team was unveiled.
Philip Campbell stood down after it emerged he told a Chinese reporter last year that the scientists at the centre of the climate-gate row “have behaved as researchers should”.
A key aspect of the review headed by Muir Russell is whether scientists at the University of East Anglia followed proper scientific procedures.
Russell’s team yesterday announced the scope of their investigation, which was triggered by a vast number of emails stolen from the University of East Anglia’s Climatic Research Unit and published online.
Some of the questions they are seeking to answer involve research published in Nature.
The review was triggered by emails purloined from the university’s Climatic Research Unit (CRU), which trigged the so-called climate-gate brouhaha.
Russell’s ‘Independent Climate Change Email Review’ is now one of five separate inquiries into the climate-gate emails.
Russell’s review today announced the key questions it thinks should be addressed.
These include questions about the use of climate data from tree rings and whether proxy temperature data and instrumental data have been improperly combined.
Climate change researchers in the UK have been subjected to a new cyber-attack.
Last month staff at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, part of the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), were sent fake emails that purported to come from Nicholas Stern, the head of the institute.
This is not a computer hacking incident such as some commentators have suggested occurred in the so-called climate-gate theft of emails from the University of East Anglia’s Climatic Research Unit.
Instead, this is an email spoofing attack where an incoming email is doctored to make it look like it has come from someone other than the real sender.
The fact that the message purported to come from Stern might suggest this was more targeted than a run-of-the-mill ‘phishing’ attack for bank details, perhaps even an incident inspired by the climate-gate theft, which gave succour to climate sceptics.
Just in case you think that the IPCC/climate-gate story has petered out in the last few days…
Phil Jones, the University of East Anglia scientist whose stolen emails caused the worldwide ‘climate-gate’ kerfuffle, has told The Sunday Times he contemplated killing himself.
The row over an erroneous claim by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that Himalayan glaciers could vanish by 2035 shows no sign of abating.
Soon we’ll be calling it ‘2035-gate’.
“The IPCC’s shortfalls are illustrated with the behaviour of Pachauri, its chair since 2002.
... Without significant institutional reform, the IPCC, and climate science as a whole, risks more than just bad press.
It risks losing its credibility and trust.”
Climate researchers Richard Tol, Roger Pielke and Hans von Storch demand the resignation of Pachauri and wholesale reform of the IPCC in an opinion piece in Spiegel .
Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, founding director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and an author of previous IPCC reports, tells the Dot Earth blog that lessons can be learned from ‘2035-gate’.
Bill Gates has expressed concern that focusing aid money on climate change at the expense of health could lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths.
In the 2010 annual letter from his charitable foundation, Gates notes that the Copenhagen Summit talked of pushing for $10 billion per year for the next three years to help developing countries deal with climate change, with a $100 billion per year by 2020 goal.
The letter goes on to say Gates is spending a lot of personal time on energy and climate and that it is vital that governments supply “large amounts” of funding for basic research as the world attempts to develop sources of cheap, low-carbon electricity.
“I am surprised that the climate debate hasn’t focused more on encouraging R&D since it is critical to getting to zero emissions,” says Gates.
“Still, I think it is likely that out of the many possible approaches, at least one scalable innovation will emerge in the next 20 years and be installed widely in the 20 years after that.”
The cold snap in Britain – seen here in this NEODAAS/University of Dundee image – has triggered a rash of ‘global warming isn’t real’ comments.
Climate scientist Mojib Latif is not a happy man.
The Leibniz Institute researcher says he “cannot understand” why his research is being cited in media reports questioning climate change.
“It comes as a surprise to me that people would try to use my statements to try to dispute the nature of global warming.
I believe in manmade global warming,” he told the Guardian .
“I have said that if my name was not Mojib Latif it would be global warming.”
“For the time being, global warming has paused, and there may well be some cooling,” it quoted him saying.
Part of the basis for the Mail’s claims appears to be Latif et al’s 2008 Nature paper, Advancing decadal-scale climate prediction in the North Atlantic sector .
This concludes that global surface temperature may not increase in the next decade as natural variations may “temporarily offset the projected anthropogenic warming”.
This paper did not pass without comment at the time.
The influential Real Climate blog offered a bet to the Nature paper’s authors that their forecast was wrong.
The Mail also cites a talk Latif gave to a Geneva conference.
But does the work really “challenge some of the global warming orthodoxy’s most deeply cherished beliefs”, as the Mail would have it?
The European Union has agreed to provide 2.4 billion euros per year from 2010 to 2012 for ‘fast start funding’ to get climate mitigation projects off the ground in developing countries.
EU leaders say they want a total of 7 billion euros per year coughed up internationally.
Europe’s move garnered praise from the UN’s top climate man, Yvo de Boer.
But if that has dampened the atmosphere at the climate talks it’s not showing.
Diplomats from across the world are still wrangling about just about everything.
At the serious end of the spectrum there has been another ‘huge fight that has the potential to derail the talks’.
This one is over proposals from the tiny island of Tuvalu to keep the rise in temperatures to 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels ( BBC ).
The 1.5 degrees proposal has received the backing of a number of small nations but UN climate chief Yvo de Boer cast doubt on the possibility of it coming to pass, saying, “It is theoretically possible that the conference will agree to hold temperatures to 1.5C but most industrialised countries have pinned their hopes on 2C.” ( Guardian .
)
At the slightly less important – but still to be taken seriously – end of the argument spectrum, Environmental Data Services reports that the Saudi Arabian delegation doesn’t like the Copenhagen logos.
Clearly the best Copenhagen cash in so far also comes via EDS , who note this gem of a press release: “Eurolines will be attending this year’s UN Climate Change Summit in Copenhagen on the 15th December to promote the environmental benefits of using coaches when travelling through Europe.”
Police in the Danish capital, where 190 governments are holding U.N. climate talks, seized a cache of paint bombs, shields and other gear overnight that they said could have been used by unruly demonstrators.
The fallout from the hacking of the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia continues this week, with huge attention still focused on the controversial content of leaked emails between leading climate scientists.
The university said on Saturday that 95% of the CRU climate data set concerning land surface temperatures has been made available to the public for “several years” and that all data will be released as soon as they are clear of non-publication agreements.
A key complaint of climate change sceptics is that the unit has been withholding information and the leaked emails show a conspiracy to keep raw data hidden.
Scientists at the University of East Anglia (UEA) have admitted throwing away much of the raw temperature data on which their predictions of global warming are based.
Phil Jones, director of the Climatic Research Unit, said that the vast majority of the station data was not altered at all, and the small amount that was changed was adjusted for consistency.
The research unit has deleted less than 5 percent of its original station data from its database because the stations had several discontinuities or were affected by urbanization trends, Jones said.
China has announced it will reduce its carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by between 40 and 45% of 2005 levels by 2020.
“Appropriate handling of the climate change issue is of vital interest to China’s social and economic development and people's fundamental interests, as well as the welfare of all the people in the world and the world's long-term development,” says the country’s State Council ( Xinhua ).
The Chinese announcement came barely hours after US President Barack Obama announced he would put a 17% below 2005 levels by 2020 offer on the table at the forthcoming Copenhagen climate talks.
However, Obama’s offer on emissions was for absolute emissions, not the ‘carbon intensity’ measure linked to GDP levels that China prefers.
Still, the UN’s top climate official Yvo de Boer said the moves by America and China “can unlock two of the last doors to a comprehensive agreement” ( AP , Bloomberg ).
The world’s carbon dioxide ‘sinks’ are not able to keep up with the amount of the greenhouse gas being produced, according to a paper published in Nature Geoscience .
Reviewing the recent literature Corinne Le Quéré, of the University of East Anglia, and colleagues report that between 1959 and 2008 43% of each year’s carbon dioxide emissions have remained in the atmosphere with the rest being absorbed by land and ocean sinks.
However in the last 50 years they suggest that the fraction remaining in the atmosphere has increased from about 40% to 45%.
“The Earth’s carbon sinks are complex and there are some gaps in our understanding, particularly in our ability to link human-induced CO2 emissions to atmospheric CO2 concentrations on a year-to-year basis,” says Le Quéré ( press release ).
“But, if we can reduce the uncertainty about the carbon sinks, our data could be used to verify the effectiveness of climate mitigations policies.”
Climate negotiators are in Barcelona, Spain, this week for the last bout of negotiating prior to the two-week Copenhagen meeting.
In December this year, parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will descend on Copenhagen to wrangle over the details of a new global climate deal — a potential successor to the Kyoto Protocol.
See Nature’s Road to Copenhagen special for more coverage.
Yvo de Boer, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, tells the meeting to make progress ( AFP ).
“A good deal for the climate is still possible.
All that is missing is political will, not least from the US, which under President Obama has fallen far behind the rest of the world, and is threatening to undermine a planet-saving agreement in Copenhagen.”
“Climate change is a ticking time bomb.
Global leaders need to act now to stop the needless deaths of millions of children.”
David Mepham, Save the Children’s policy director, says climate change could kill 250,000 children in 2010 and over 400,000 by 2030 ( Daily Telegraph ).
Republicans and Democrats have been wrangling this week over proposed legislation to tackle climate change.
In the course of this spat it emerged that the former were considering frustrating the latter by forcing the entire 900 page bill and its 400 amendments to be read aloud.
Climate change could force birds to migrate hundreds of extra miles, according to new research.
The extra distance might even be deadly.
“From 2071 to 2100, nine out of the 17 species we looked at are projected to face longer migrations, particularly birds that cross the Sahara desert,” says Willis ( press release ).
“Our findings show that marathon migrations for some birds are set to become even longer journeys.
... The added distance is a considerable threat.”
Arctic sea ice continues to shrink, according to the latest satellite data.
And in a scenario all too familiar to people of a certain age, the ice that is left has been replaced by a younger, thinner version of itself.
According to the US National Snow and Ice Data Center, the maximum extent of Arctic sea ice last winter was the fifth lowest on record.
All sixth lowest maximums have occurred in the last six years ( press release ).
This year’s maximum was 15.16 million square kilometres, which is smaller than the 1979-2000 average by an area roughly the size of Texas (or France).
Younger, thinner ice which melts every year is now 70% of Arctic sea ice, says the NSIDC, meaning melting is easier.
In the 1980s and 90s this type of ice was between 40 and 50% of the total.
This week’s UN hosted climate change talks in Bonn, Germany, are well underway.
According to New Scientist this climate summit is “more important than the G20”.
This meeting is the first of five sessions leading up to what the UN says will be an “ambitious and effective international climate change deal” to be finalised in Copenhagen in December ( pdf ).
The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has already started its ‘countdown to Copenhagen’ timer.
However, as Reuters pointed out on Wednesday, delegates from 175 nations even managed to argue about what they were arguing about.
The question is whether they should come up with a ‘treaty’, a ‘protocol’ an ‘agreement’, a ‘deal’, or a ‘decision’ to succeed the Kyoto protocol.
A controversial experiment which poured iron into the Southern Ocean has also poured cold water on the idea that such ‘ocean fertilization’ can mitigate against climate change.
The Lohafex project was investigating suggestions that carbon dioxide can be removed from the atmosphere by promoting algal blooms with iron.
Despite protests from some groups , researchers aboard the Polarstern research vessel carried out their experiment this month.
However, the Alfred-Wegener institute, which was backing Lohafex, says “only a modest amount of carbon sank out of the surface layer by the end of the experiment.
Hence, the transfer of CO2 from the atmosphere to the ocean to compensate the deficit caused by the LOHAFEX bloom was minor compared to earlier ocean iron fertilization experiments.”
New Yorkers beware!
A new study published in Nature Geoscience says the north-eastern US coast will be in more trouble from global warming than previously believed.
Looking at the predictions from a whole set of different climate models, researchers Jianjun Yin, Michael Schlesinger and Ronald Stouffer found that changes in ocean circulation will result in higher sea levels in the region, over and above expected global sea level changes.
Depending on whether greenhouse gas emissions are low or high, an additional rise of between 15 and 21 cm can be expected by 2100, they say.
“Our results show that the northeast coast of the United States is among the most vulnerable regions to future changes in sea level and ocean circulation, especially when considering its population density and the potential socioeconomic consequences of such changes,” write the researchers.
“It should be noted that the impact of the melting of the Greenland ice sheet on the [Atlantic meridional overturning circulation] is not taken into account here.”
Researchers at Purdue University in Indiana, with funding from NASA, have shoehorned a wealth of data on carbon dioxide emissions into the interactive globe tool that is Google Earth.
It’s a timely move, given that the Environmental Protection Agency seems to be preparing to regulate carbon dioxide for the first time ( NY Times ) and NASA is about to launch its Orbiting Carbon Observatory ( Nature Reports Climate Change ).
“From a societal perspective, Vulcan provides a description of where and when society influences climate change through fossil-fuel carbon dioxide emissions,” says researcher Kevin Gurney of Purdue ( press release ).
“Users can see their county or state in relation to others, and see what aspects of economic activity are driving fossil-fuel emissions.
Vulcan could help demystify climate change and empower people in the same way as seeing the miles-per-gallon number on the dashboard of a hybrid car.”
There’s nothing like a good climate change-denial article to get the internet all riled up, and boy has Erika Lovley done some riling.
The one generating most ire is the frankly spectacular ‘ Scientists urge caution on global warming ’.
This claims there is “a growing accumulation of global cooling science and other findings that could signal that the science behind global warming may still be too shaky to warrant cap-and-trade legislation”.
At least, they used to undergo massive population explosions.
In a paper published this week in Nature a group of researchers analyse the absence of such events since 1994.
The culprit, you guessed it, is climate change.
Nils Stenseth and colleagues show that changes in winter weather and snow go hand-in-hand with changes in Lemmus lemmus populations.
They further show that when the regular explosion of lemming numbers doesn’t occur predators such as foxes switch their attention to other species, leading to knock-on effects throughout the eco-system.
In a News and Views piece analysing the research, Tim Coulson and Aurelio Malo, of Imperial College London, explain that lemmings like to scurry about in a gap that warm ground melts between it and the snow layer above it.
This so-called subnivean space is relatively warm and keeps the rodents safe from things that would like to eat them.
What Stenseth and colleagues found was that climate change seems to have eliminated the subnivean space and, worse, created a sheet of ice over the moss on which lemmings like to nibble.
“The critical reader will complain that the story is based on correlations.
Although this is true, it is often the only way to study populations and the consequences of changing climate for ecosystems,” write Coulson and Malo.
“The collection of detailed long-term data on the dynamics of free-living populations of animals and plants rarely attracts the same excitement as genomics or particle physics, yet such data are vital in characterizing the consequences of climate change for the natural world on which we depend.”
Cyclones appear to be responsible for a large amount of organic carbon tied up in ocean sediments.
In a paper published in Nature Geoscience, Robert Hilton and colleagues report on the impact of cyclone-induced floods on carbon in the LiWu River in Taiwan.
They found that between 77 and 92% of non-fossil carbon eroded from the LiWu catchment area was moved during floods linked to cyclones.
As increased sea surface temperatures from global warming could increase the intensity of cyclones, this could create negative feedback, with bigger cyclones locking up more organic carbon in sediments.
Sadly this is not going to stop global warming.
Criminal damage in the name of climate change is not a criminal offence, according to a shock ruling from a British court.
A jury yesterday acquitted six Greenpeace activists who claimed that the threat of global warming was a ‘lawful excuse’ for the damage they caused while protesting at a coal power plant (see this blog post for background).
Climate change scientist James Hansen had previously backed the six: he released a statement declaring “We will need our Mercedes-driving lawyer friends to tell us if the verdict has greater significance -- but the jurors were common people, not politicians.
“The main point, that the government, the utility, and the fossil fuel industry, were aware of the facts [of climate change] but continued to ignore them are more generally valid worldwide.
It raises the question of whether the right people are on trial.”
The contentious ‘hockey stick’ climate change graph has again been upheld as broadly accurate, doubtless to the rage of climate denialists/sceptics/whatevers.
Has global warming stopped?
Is this a nail in Al Gore’s coffin?
What this new paper by Noel Keenlyside, of the Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences in Germany, sets out to do is incorporate data on short term variations in climate into our models of climate change.
By doing this they push us into the arena of creating shorter term predictions, in this case of the next decade.
This does not mean we don’t need to worry about global warming.
“The natural variations change climate on this timescale and policymakers may either think mitigation is working or that there is no global warming at all,” says Keenlyside ( Reuters ).
Whether their prediction of a plateau for warming for a decade in North America and Europe is correct or not, their research may signal a shift that many climate researchers have been calling for for awhile now — toward service-oriented climate science ...
The NY Times wraps up its main piece with a useful quote from Kevin Trenberth, of the US National Center for Atmospheric Research: “Too many think global warming means monotonic relentless warming everywhere year after year.
It does not happen that way.”
I am sure that this is an excellent paper by world class scientists.
But when I look at the broader significance of the paper what I see is that there is in fact nothing that can be observed in the climate system that would be inconsistent with climate model predictions.
If global cooling over the next few decades is consistent with model predictions, then so too is pretty much anything and everything under the sun.
The BBC is facing allegations that it altered a news story about climate at the behest of an activist.
A series of emails from BBC reporter Roger Harrabin and activist Jo Abbess were posted on the Campaign Against Climate Change website on April 4th.
After a series of back and forths Harrabin writes “Have a look in 10 minutes and tell me you are happier.
... We have changed headline and more”.
The original headline - Global Warming ‘dips this year’ – changed to the current Global Temperatures ‘to decrease’.
Needless to say as soon as these emails were noticed they were picked up by unhappy sceptic bloggers ( here , here and here for example).
The BBC told us:
This would mean global temperatures have not risen since 1998, prompting some to question climate change theory.
But this year's temperatures would still be way above the average - and we would soon exceed the record year of 1998 because of global warming induced by greenhouse gases.
Europe and the US could be headed for a trade war over climate change.
Climate change is being blamed for problems at the annual ice festival in Harbin, China.
Huge intricate sculptures are disappearing before the thousands of tourists that flock to the festival get to see them.
“"The average temperature of winter in Harbin is 5 degrees Celsius higher than historical records,” says Yin Xuemian, a senior meteorologist at the Heilongjiang Observatory ( Reuters ).
“In December 2002, ice lanterns in Harbin melted right after they were sculpted.
[In 2006] Lots of money and energy were spent on redoing the sculptures.
As the temperature rises, the period of ice and snow activities have shortened dramatically.”
If you like coral reefs you should enjoy them while you can, they won’t be around for long.
Global warming and the ocean acidification that comes with it will decimate reefs by the end of this century, according to a new review article in Science.
“The impact of climate change on coral reefs is much closer than we appreciated.
It's just around the corner,” says study author Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, of the University of Queensland.
“... The warmer and more acidic oceans caused by the rise of carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels threaten to destroy coral reef ecosystems, exposing people to flooding, coastal erosion and the loss of food and income from reef-based fisheries and tourism.
And this is happening just when many nations are hoping that these industries would allow them to alleviate their impoverished state.” ( Reuters ... Telegraph )
Although there is no new original research here, when all the numbers are brought together they are pretty frightening.
Atmospheric carbon dioxide will exceed 500 parts per million sometime between 2050 and 2100.
This will drive global temperatures up at least 2°C, “values that significantly exceed those of at least the past 420,000 years during which most extant marine organisms evolved” says the paper.
It seems obvious that penguins will be in trouble if global warming continues.
If you like it cold and icy then a hotter planet is not going to work in your favour.
A new report from environmental group WWF highlights the problems the dinner-jacketed birds face.
“As the ice melts, these icons of the Antarctic will have to face an extremely tough battle to survive,” says Emily Lewis-Brown, Marine and Climate Change Officer at WWF-UK ( press release ).
WWF says overfishing and a reduction in sea ice is putting the Emperor, Gentoo, Chinstrap, and Adélie penguins under pressure.
The report is actually just a two page document timed to coincide with Bali and it has long been known that penguins have, in the words of 2001 paper published in Nature (subscription required), “potential high susceptibility to climate change”.
While the world’s climate experts meet in Bali, the rest of the world is getting on with the serious business of elaborate hoaxes and stating the obvious.
First up: activists from the Rising Tide movement successfully impersonated a major business group and pretended they were going to cut carbon emissions by 90%.
“Leading scientists say decisive action must happen now to reduce our emissions.
However, corporate interests have stymied substantive action and are derailing genuine efforts of civil society to adequately address climate change,” says Matt Leonard, member of the movement ( press release ).
Wired has a full interview .
The spoof press release was supposedly from the US Climate Action Partnership, which counts General Motors, Shell, and environmentalists’ bête noire Rio Tinto among its members.
Both blogs and news sources were taken in: examples with later retractions at Thomson Financial News ( story , correction ) and It’s Getting Hot In Here ( original , correction ).
A fraudulent news release was distributed today that misstates the positions of the US Climate Action Partnership (USCAP).
In addition, the release cites a website that does not represent USCAP or its views.
Neither USCAP nor its member organizations were involved in the development of this website or the distribution of today's announcement.
This fraudulent website has been shut down.
It’s not a good time to be a flying fox.
Justin Welbergen, from the University of Cambridge, has just published some new research on them and he thinks climate change means they are all going to die.
The issue for the animals, which are not foxes at all but fruit bats, is that they’re just not that good with heat.
This is a bit of a problem if you live in an Australia that is getting slowly hotter.
Welbergen and his colleagues found that temperature extremes caused mass die-offs, with females and the young being especially vulnerable.
When temperatures reached 42.9°C, thousands of the bats keeled over and flapped no more ( paper should appear here today).
Climate change may also be benefiting some types of the bat, by allowing them to expand their range by reducing the number of cold nights, which they can’t tolerate.
“If so, this provides an example of how climate change may act like a double-edged sword,” write Welbergen and co, “it can cause a species to expand its distribution in response to a reduction in the number of cold nights, while putting the same species at an increased risk from extreme warm events.
It has been acknowledged before that climate change is causing changes in species distributions.
Nature Reports Climate Change had an article on this recently , noting that in Australia some possums have been getting so hot they fell out of their trees.
Stefan Klose, one of the research team, told the Daily Telegraph , “In a very dramatic way we see the outcome of extreme climate events that are predicted to increase as a result of climate change by the Intergovermental Panel on Climate Change.
These animals are simply not able to cope with higher temperatures and so they die.
They are the seed dispersers for Australia's rainforest so the ecosystem effects could be very considerable.”
According to the Times over 30,000 fruit bats have died since 1994 in heat waves “associated with global warming”.
Conservation Magazine thinks monitoring roosts when high temperatures are expected is the way forward.
This isn’t going to please fruit growers.
According to the North Queensland Register a “‘plague” of flying foxes is tormenting the regions’ farmers.
A small piece of good news for the animals: lychee farms in North Queensland have been told to dismantle electric grids used to stop bats eating the tasty fruit ( ABC ).
This year’s edition of the UN Human Development Report makes bleak reading.
Unless we deal with climate change, it says, efforts to reduce poverty will stall then reverse, the poorest countries will suffer first and not even the richest countries will escape global warming.
Efforts to improve health and education are also threatened ( summary PDF , full report PDF ).
“Ultimately, climate change is a threat to humanity as a whole.
But it is the poor, a constituency with no responsibility for the ecological debt we are running up, who face the immediate and most severe human costs,” said Kemal Derviş, administrator of the UN Development Programme ( press release PDF ).
More droughts, floods and storms are already reinforcing existing inequalities in standards of living, says the report.
Climate change must be tackled now.
“The world lacks neither the financial resources nor the technological capabilities to act.
What is missing is a sense of urgency, human solidarity and collective interest,” says the UN (report home page ).
“This innovation, compared to what we had available most recently, is like watching the most spectacular high-definition TV in living colour versus watching the picture on a small black-and-white television,” says Robert Bindschadler, chief scientist of the Hydrospheric and Biospheric Sciences Laboratory at Goddard (NSF press release ).
The appearance of a massive swarm of jellyfish, and their subsequent decimation of an Irish salmon farm, are this week being blamed on global warming.
This isn't the first time climate change has been linked to jellyfish outbreaks.
Last summer, the same jellyfish (Pelagia notiluca) was spotted in unusually high concentrations in the Mediterranean, again prompting speculation about impacts of sea temperature rise ( New Scientist ).
Reuters reported that a volunteer campaign had removed eight tons of jellyfish from the Spanish coastline.
Both reports mention temperature and decline in predators as causes.
A recent study linked increasing populations of jellyfish in the North Sea to climate change and predicted that more jellyfish would appear over the next 100 years.
If the two events are truly linked the UK's salmon industry may have to be added to the list of climate change victims.
World experts have gathered in Valencia to produce a synthesis of all the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports released to date ( Nature – subscription required).
Thus, there is a rash of climate change news.
In Australia the former head of the country’s Commonwealth Scientific and Research Organization’s atmospheric research unit warned before the meeting that current policy is based on science that is already out of date ( ABC ).
“If you think climate change is on the agenda, just wait another couple of years,” he told the Sydney Morning Herald .
online resource dedicated to in-depth coverage of climate science and the implications for policy, the economy and society.
The collapse of UN-led international efforts to combat climate change means a new approach that is “politically attractive and relentlessly pragmatic” is required, according to a new report.
The 14 authors of a new report on climate policy describe themselves as “an eclectic group of academics, analysts and energy policy advocates”.
They say the Kyoto Protocol style approach “crashed” last year with the perceived failure of the Copenhagen meeting.
“To reframe the climate issue around matters of human dignity is not just noble or necessary.
It is also likely to be more effective than the approach of framing around human sinfulness –which has failed and will continue to fail,” write the authors , including Gwyn Prins, of the London School of Economics; Roger Pielke Jr, of the University of Colorado; and Hiroyuki Tezuka, who represented the Japan Iron and Steel Federation.
A new approach should focus on three objectives, says the paper, ensuring energy access for all, developing in a way that does not undermine Earth systems, and ensuring societies can withstand all climate vagaries, “whatever their cause may be”.
The Hartwell group argues that the inclusive approach of previous attempts to reach a global climate consensus needs to be broken up, with forests, biodiversity, air quality and other issues put back into silos and made to “again stand on their own”.
Their paper also suggests that an almost exclusive focus on carbon dioxide is unwise, and there should be more action on other greenhouse agents, such as black carbon and tropospheric ozone.
Bill Hare, of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, told the BBC , he did not buy this.
“The paper’s focus away from CO2 is misguided, short-sighted and probably wrong,” says Hare.
“If you take action on black carbon and do not reduce CO2 emissions then you may end up with more warming in the long term.”
Hare also says that the Kyoto Protocol is “one of the few things that have worked” and he questions the Hartwell group's acceptance of industry funding.
Philanthropic institutions in the United States more than tripled their support for climate-related causes in 2008 relative to the previous year, reports Laura Thompson Osuri today on Nature news.
The findings come from the Foundation Center, a New York-based organization that supports philanthropies.
In total, donations shot up from a 2007 total of US$240 million to $897 million in 2008, and covered a wide variety of activities.
Some examples of initiatives funded in 2008 include research by Stanford scientists into adapting agriculture for a warmer climate and work by a Wang Lan, a materials scientist at the China Building Materials Academy in Beijing, on reducing greenhouse-gas emissions from cement production.
None of the foundations contacted by Nature would divulge their planned contributions for 2010.
Because Hewlett will not repeat its $500-million, one-time donation, however, the total foundation support for climate-related causes is likely to drop from its 2008 high, reports Thompson Osuri.
Considered by some a silver bullet and by others a hopeless dream, the idea that we can simply capture our carbon dioxide emissions and store them safely away is nothing if not compelling.
After all, it lends an air of practicality to the notion that human ingenuity can somehow continue the unabated use of fossil fuels over the coming decades without dangerously warming the climate.
This week’s Science (subscription) looks at how close we are to being able to capture carbon dioxide, both from the point of emission at coal- or gas-burning power plants, and directly from air.
A series of news, opinion and review articles shows that while many obstacles need to be overcome before carbon capture and storage (CCS) is implemented effectively, there are also abundant reasons to hope that it will happen.
But the scale of the challenge is palpable.
In a review , Stuart Hazeldine of the University of Edinburgh, UK, says that the construction of many tens to hundreds of large CCS plants worldwide would be needed to reduce future worldwide emissions from energy by 20%.
And in order for the technology to make a substantial contribution to climate mitigation, a viable CCS industry needs to be in place between 2020 and 2030.
Construction would have to start now if plants fitted with CCS technology are to be operational by 2014, giving enough time to demonstrate commercial credibility by 2020.
The UK's Met Office has had its funding for climate research slashed by a quarter, following withdrawal of financial support by the government's Ministry of Defence (MoD).
The loss of £4.3 million (US$7.0 million) in funding from the MoD will affect the Met Office Hadley Centre for Climate Change in Exeter, the world-class climate modelling institute whose researchers made key contributions to the last assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2007.
"This news comes as a shock," says climate scientist Martin Parry, formerly at the Met Office and now at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change at Imperial College London.
"The UK's core modelling work on climate change has been funded from this source, up to now.
"
Now that remarkable headway has been made into understanding the physical science of climate change, there’s a feeling among climate experts – including those of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – and among funding agencies of the need to shift the focus of climate research from identifying the cause to assessing the impacts, whether hurricanes, oceanic dead zones or forest fires.
A case in point is the new study just launched by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) is the US to examine how climate change will influence hurricane activity in the coming decades.
In an excellent news feature in Science magazine, Eli Kintisch takes up the issue by looking at how the $1.8 billion available for the US Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) is likely to be reoriented towards climate impacts research under a new administration.
But evaluating climate impacts will require more than a shift in CCSP’s vision.
As Kintisch points out, the research budget available to CCSP has declined from $1.9 billion in 1994, whereas climate research advocates estimate approximately $4.5 billion will be needed by 2014 to sustain the needs of both academic and federal climate scientists.
The widening gap between escalating costs and narrowing research budgets is placing a strain on basic earth monitoring and means that fewer scientists are tackling increasingly complex issues, such as the impacts of aerosols, writes Kintisch.

In 2002, the world's governments agreed to significantly slow the rate of biodiversity loss by 2010.
Time is almost up, and by most accounts they've failed.
Now that climate change is emerging as one of biodiversity's greatest threats, scientists are proposing new ways to tackle the crisis.
Hannah Hoag reports.
“The first business of conservation is telling species apart,” says Hebert.
Before barcoding, biological specimens were identified on the basis of morphology, behaviour and genetics.
The technique will offer a “quantum jump” in the rate that species are registered, says Hebert.
What once took months can now take a few hours.
It also gives biodiversity a boost: barcoding has repeatedly shown that one species is, in fact, three, or ten (Evol.
Biol. 7, 121; 2007).
Dan Janzen, a tropical ecologist and conservation biologist who splits his time between the University of Pennsylvania in Philadephia and the Area de Conservación Guanacaste (ACG) in Costa Rica, sees the value in DNA barcoding.
He is charged with identifying the estimated 12,500 species of caterpillar in the ACG — an area the size of New York City and its suburbs.
In his years of studying this conservation area, he has witnessed changes in biodiversity.
For one, the species he studies are moving up the mountains.
In general, species worldwide are expected to try to move to higher elevations as temperatures rise.
As DNA barcoding technology matures, one can envisage scientists using handheld DNA decoders to document such changes in a region's biodiversity or to rapidly identify regions that contain species of interest.
“If we are engaged in a game of triage, we might like to preserve those that are genetically distinct,” says Hebert.
Managed by a three-way agreement among the Norwegian government and two conservation organizations — the Global Crop Diversity Trust and the Nordic Genetic Resource Center — the vault aims to safeguard crop genetic diversity, which will provide resources to help agriculture adapt to climate change.
Although seed banks exist globally, the vault at Svalbard is an insurance policy against the loss of seeds held elsewhere.
Most of today's crops have been carefully bred for traits that fit the present climate.
According to modelling studies, climate change will start to negatively affect crop production by 2050.
In southern Africa, for example, maize yields are predicted to fall by as much as 30 per cent if temperatures rise 1 °C ( Science 319, 607–610; 2008 ).
And with a 2 °C temperature rise, more than 80 per cent of the land area over most African nations would be climatically unsuitable for the crops now growing there (Glob.
Environ. Change 19, 317–325; 2009).
“That would be a food crisis,” says Cary Fowler, executive director of the Global Crop Diversity Trust.
Fowler says it's likely that farmers will have to adapt their agricultural practices by using analogous crops from other locations in the future.
But if today's varieties do not adapt to tomorrow's climates, new varieties containing traits for drought tolerance or pest resistance, for example, could be bred using seeds from global seed banks, or from the Svalbard vault, as a last resort.
Domesticated crops aren't the only ones at risk: as many as 16 to 22 per cent of the wild relatives of cowpea, peanut and potato could go extinct by 2055, according to one study (Agric.
Ecosys. Environ.
126, 13–23; 2008).
Experts such as Kenneth Street, a genetic resource scientist at the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas, in Aleppo, Syria, are tracking down these wild relatives, which could be used to boost a crop's genetic diversity and resilience to climate change.
Using electronic maps that show soil type and climate, these modern-day seed hunters identify environments with conditions that favour genetic diversity.
“Usually, we travel to high lands or marginal lands where modern varieties couldn't grow, where farmers are eking out an existence with marginal crops or still using traditional varieties,” says Street.
“We concentrate on areas that are likely to have drier, or hotter, or more salty conditions.” A recent expedition to Tajikistan led Street to a remote village where farmers handed him a collection of wheat seeds, one of which offered resistance to Sunn pest, an insect that favours warmth and destroys cereal crops in warm dry areas.
“We are continually on the hunt for novel sources of resistance,” he says.
“To some, agriculture is the enemy in the climate change debate — it is the source of a lot of greenhouse gases,” says Fowler.
“But we have to make sure that agriculture adapts.
If it doesn't, all our other efforts on climate change are down the drain.”
The Nature Conservancy has made conservation investments in Columbian watersheds, including Chingaza National Park, which provides water to Bogotá.
“There are many stresses from water use.
The sugar cane sector is thirsty, but the people who live there also need it for daily activities and for drinking water,” says Alejandro Calvache, a water fund specialist at The Nature Conservancy, based in Cartagena, Columbia.
TNC, in collaboration with the sugar cane growers' association, the regional environmental authority and several grassroots organizations, is building a water fund that will oversee a massive program of reforestation, water protection, soil improvements, education and training.
By investing in the region's ecosystem services, the project, which is called 'Agua Por La Vida y la Sostenibilidad ' — meaning 'Water for Life and sustainability' — aims to lessen climate change impacts and threats to biodiversity.
Water funds exist globally to conserve watersheds, but this is one of the first to include climate change modelling to help direct investments.
The International Center for Tropical Agriculture, a research institute in Columbia, is modelling scenarios to determine the effects of climate change on local water resources.
These scenarios are then fed into a computer-based decision-making tool called InVEST, which has been developed by the Natural Capital Project, a partnership between TNC, Stanford University and the World Wildlife Fund.
InVEST identifies the areas where climate change is unlikely to threaten activities the water fund has been invested in — such as promoting the reforestation of a hillside or teaching eco-friendly cattle-ranching practices — and their returns.
“Traditionally, conservation has pulled on people's heart-strings,” says Heather Tallis, lead scientist at Natural Capital.
“We try to appeal to people's lifeblood, like drinking water.”
Some researchers caution, however, that accurate regional climate change forecasts are still fraught with uncertainty (Nature 463, 284–287; 2010), so care is warranted in relying on them to direct investment decisions.
But Calvache says one of the strengths of the climate-influenced approach is its flexibility.
“You can invest money, see what happens and see if those were the best returns in terms of conservation goals,” he says.
“There are many uncertainties in climate change ... being flexible is extremely important.”
Some species have shifted their ranges in response to climate change, but not all will be able to keep pace.
That realization radicalized Camille Parmesan, an integrative biologist at the University of Texas at Austin.
She figured out that some threatened species could be rescued by deliberately removing them from dead-end locations and relocating them to more appropriate climes, an intervention dubbed 'assisted migration', 'assisted colonization' or 'managed relocation' ( Science 321, 345–346; 2008 ).
“You might have really good intentions, but in many cases it will come with a large risk,” says Jessica Hellmann, a conservation biologist at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana who recently proposed a decision-making framework for 'managed relocation' that can help characterize uncertainty and establish priorities (Proc.
Natl Acad.
Sci. USA 106, 9721–9724; 2009).
Ricciardi points out that unless you address the root causes of climate change, assisted migration “will temporarily save a species at best, until you have to move it again”.
Still, says Parmesan, “This tiny amount of warming is already causing conservation problems.
You've got to be willing to do something that's a little more risky.
There is no no-risk option.”
Over the year, the endangered loggerhead turtle meanders through the ocean, foraging on jellyfish and crustaceans along sea surface temperature fronts.
The position and intensity of these thermal gradients, which are set up by ocean circulation, are expected to shift with climate change, altering the turtles' preferred locations.
But where and when they'll move is uncertain.
The loggerhead's dynamic range means that stationary marine protected areas may not adequately protect the turtle.
But a mobile protective area that moves in space and time, following sea surface temperature fronts, just might do the job (Conserv.
Biol. 24, 70–77; 2010).
Traditional conservation approaches assumed species ranges would always stay in the same place: if you protected the geographic region, the species within it would be protected forever.
But species don't stay put when temperatures move outside their comfort range.
This realization has changed the way people think about conservation strategies, says Lee Hannah, a senior scientist in climate change biology at Conservation International's Center for Applied Biodiversity Science in Santa Barbara, California.
The concept could be applied more broadly to other marine species, such as sharks or whales, and to land-based animals.
A whole population of animals threatened by climate change could be tagged with microscopic trackers and followed through space and time, allowing the protected space to be modified as the animals move seasonally to feed and breed.
The IPBES would offer scientific advice to governments on the societal services provided by ecosystems such as rainforests.
Come June, biologists and policymakers will gather in South Korea to discuss the future of a proposed scientific panel to monitor biodiversity and offer advice on its protection.
Although the idea for the panel, which would compare in scope and size with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), was first discussed publicly at a 2005 international conference on biodiversity in Paris ( Nature 442, 245–246; 2006 ), it has recently gained momentum.
At the launch of the International Year of Biodiversity in Berlin in January, German Premier Angela Merkel championed its creation.
Says Neville Ash, the head of ecosystem management at the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, in Geneva, “When you think about climate change, the IPCC is the standard authoritative reference on the state of the science.
That is entirely missing on the state of biodiversity and ecosystem services.
If you're a policymaker at the international level, there isn't a single consolidated and robust source of science on biodiversity and ecosystem services to turn to.”
Like the IPCC, the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) would improve the links between science and policy, and ensure decisions are based on the best available science ( Curr.
Opin. Environ.
Sustain.10.1016/j.cosust.2010.02.006 ; in the press).
It would oversee global and regional biodiversity assessments, identify and analyse trends, and explore future changes.
It would also invest in training.
“Scientific capacity around the globe is not equal,” says Harold Mooney, an environmental biologist at Stanford University and the chair of Diversitas, an international programme of biodiversity science.
“Capacity building is one of the pillars of the programme.”
Though scientists are generally supportive of the idea, some are concerned that the IPBES will consume the lion's share of their research time and that its impact is unsure.
“Basic research on climate systems gets shunted aside in order to get the 'products' out that have been promised to policymakers in each IPCC report,” says Parmesan.
“What has to be considered is whether the trade-off [of] good policies gained by such an assessment would be worth the good science lost.”
June 1 is almost here, and for residents of the eastern US, Caribbean and Central America that means just one thing: stock up on the plywood and batten down the hatches, for the Atlantic hurricane season is upon us.
This week’s Nature features a minor rush of hurricane-related items.
First off, in a technical manuscript , Ryan Sriver and Matthew Huber of Purdue University spell out how tropical cyclones could play a significant role in mixing the ocean’s topmost layers.
They find that about 15 percent of the peak ocean heat transport can be linked to the ocean mixing caused by cyclones.
Kerry Emanuel of MIT has had much the same idea before, but the Purdue work extends and better quantifies the role of hurricanes.
It’s an interesting study that turns some conventional wisdom on its head: instead of worrying about how climate change affects hurricanes, maybe we should be worrying instead about how hurricanes affect climate change.
Quirin Schiermeier, our correspondent in Munich, has a longer news feature on this, plus more on ocean mixing in general.
(See also Martin Visbeck’s essay on ocean mixing from last week).
I've got a short news story previewing the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season.
The National Hurricane Center in Miami has put out almost exactly the same forecast as last year, calling for an above-average number of storms.
The 2006 predictions didn’t pan out so well – blame a late summer El Nino that surged unexpectedly, quashing the number of expected hurricanes.
This year, forecasters don’t expect that to happen – and in fact anticipate a weak La Nina, the opposite weather pattern that should permit more hurricanes to form.
In other words, buckle up.
One of the interesting things about this year’s season is that there is a new director for the hurricane center.
This is a very big and high-profile job in the US; the center director serves as a public face for warning of dangerous storms, including trying to get people to evacuate when necessary.
The previous director, Max Mayfield, was well liked by nearly everyone (even if New Orleans officials didn’t listen to his warnings as much as perhaps they should have as Hurricane Katrina approached the city in August 2005).
Now the hot seat belongs to Bill Proenza, a former director of the southern region of the National Weather Service.
He’s a frequent and outspoken critic of his bosses, and this month has been complaining that his center doesn’t get enough money for forecasting.
He may be right, but the Atlantic is by far the best-funded and best-studied of all the world’s hurricane regions.
Let us not forget the Pacific or the Indian oceans, which get hammered regularly without the benefit of a highly regarded, highly publicized hurricane center to spread warnings.
If you want to stay up to date as the hurricane season progresses, I recommend checking out the Florida newspapers.
The Miami Herald and the St. Petersburg Times are particularly good sources of local information.
For more of an overview, check out this week’s New York Times science section , which has a pair of lead stories devoted to hurricanes; John Schwartz, a technology reporter who covered much of the Katrina failure, has a piece on how engineers try to outwit the storms through construction.
And Cornelia Dean, who has long covered coastal development issues, has a good overview on the ongoing debates over the potential links between climate change and hurricanes.
Here at Nature, we too will do our part to keep you involved and informed.
Complementing our existing coverage online and in print, Nature Reports Climate Change , NPG's dedicated climate change website will be launching next week - check in with us for updated coverage as the season gets underway.
For climate relevant stuff, of which there's a nice amount, try the Earth and Environment category .
It boasts Peter Liss on the links between phytopankton and clouds, Andrew Watson on the circulation of the southern ocean and its importance in ice ages, and Eric Wolff on phase-locking and Milankovitch cycles.
And there's plenty more for the broad of interest -- try Axel Kleidon on the emergent properties of life and climate, David Wilkinson on what it means to be putrid or Daniel Pauly on pirates, bio-oceanography and short collective memories.
Solutions to climate change could come in extremely small sizes, according to a report released last week by the UK Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA).
“Environmentally Beneficial Nanotechnologies: Barriers and Opportunities” explores the application of nanoscience in five key areas that could reduce greenhouse gas emissions, namely: insulation, photovoltaics, electricity storage, engine efficiency and the hydrogen economy.
The report suggests that applying nanotechnology in these five key areas could contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by up to 2 % in the short term and up to 20 % by 2050 with similar reductions in air pollution.
Nanotech innovations could also provide a solution to reducing cost and increasing efficiency of solar cells.
The report says this is unlikely to result in significant GHG emission reduction in the UK, where there is relatively little sun, but could be of significance to reducing global emissions.
Jonathan Kohler at the Department of Land Economy, University of Cambridge, however, believes that photovoltaics can have a significant output even in British climatic conditions.
If the cost was reduced through advances in nanotechnology, we could see the large scale application of photovoltaics in the UK in the next twenty years, he says.
A nanotech application with clear benefits for a country like the UK where 50% of energy demand is domestic would be the development of effective insulation for solid walled buildings.
As a branch of science in its infancy, significant peer-reviewed research in this area is yet to come – as a result the latest IPCC WGIII report on mitigating climate change doesn’t consider nanotech solutions to climate change.
Aside from the funding and research required to develop these concepts, there are specific concerns that need to be addressed such as the potential toxicity of newly developed materials and the need to allay public fears that the materials could behave both strangely…and unpredictably.
Here is the situation: Annex I countries that cannot meet their GHG emissions targets under the Kyoto Protocol pay into the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) fund, which then pays for emissions reductions in developing countries.
These emissions reductions can take many forms as long as "additionality" can be proven – that is, the reduction in GHGs would not have occurred without the CDM funding.
CDM projects have included capturing landfill-produced methane, creating facilities to burn biomass for energy, and installing wind power capacity.
However, CDM projects have also included burning HFC-23 and this is where the perverse incentive creeps up.
HFC-23 is the byproduct of HCFC-22 production.
HCFC-22 is a refrigerant and strong ozone depletor, ostensibly banned by the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer.
Developing countries, however, were given a loophole arrangement under the Montreal Protocol (MP) specifically for HCFC-22, so while most countries in the world with any degree of industrial activity have agreed to abide by the MP, developing countries do not have to meet HCFC-22 phase-out targets.
Because of this loophole, as a cheap and effective refrigerant HCFC-22 continues to be an important industrial chemical, produced in especially high volume by "rich developing" countries such as China, India and Korea.
Both HCFC-22 and HFC-23 are also strong greenhouse gasses, but HFC-23 has a 270-year lifetime in the atmosphere, HCFC-22 only 12 years, and thus HFC-23 has over ten times the Global Warming Potential of HCFC-22 at 14,800 times CO2-equivalent (see Table TS.2 in the WGI Technical Summary of IPCC AR4 ).
Those seeking to fund CDM projects jumped early at the chance to abate the release of HFC-23 to the atmosphere.
It turned out to be quite easy (read: cheap) to install capture-and-burn equipment on HCFC-22 factories, and with a ton of HFC-23 burned being the equivalent of over 14,000 tons of CO2 prevented from reaching the atmosphere, the race to fund HFC-23 burn projects was on.
The problem from an international policy perspective is that producers of HCFC-22 now make more money burning HFC-23 than they do selling HCFC-22.
Imagine what being paid handsomely to burn your waste does to your incentive to reduce your waste.
If your waste stream costs you to dispose of it, you might try to improve your production to reduce waste and thus save money.
And even if you did get paid to burn your waste, it might make financial sense to reduce waste anyway if your efficiency improvements paid more in reduced operating expenses than burning waste generated in income.
But neither is the case for HCFC-22 factories.
For them a double financial incentive now exists: keep making HCFC-22 in copious amounts at a profit, which will produce HFC-23 as a now-valuable waste product.
And since HCFC-22 producers need not even lift a finger to burn their HFC-23 (those funding the CDM project fund the capture and burn device), any incentive for switching away from the ozone-depleting HCFC-22 as a refrigerant is also destroyed.
Aside from very good in-depth reporting from Fiona Harvey of the Financial Times, based in part on the work of Michael Wara of Stanford (see the 8-Feb-07 issue of Nature ), the HCFC-22/HFC-23 issue has gone largely unreported thus far.
While the New York Times has run a small handful of articles in the past year on HCFC-22 and its ozone-depleting properties, none have raised the HFC-23 specter.
According to my Lexis-Nexis search, no other American newspaper has covered the issue.
As individual states in the U.S. begin forming interstate agreements on GHG trading in advance of a federally-instituted nationwide emissions reduction program, unintended consequences like depleting stratospheric ozone in favor of reducing GHGs will need to be carefully watched for.
It looks as if the Southern Ocean - the great white hope for sucking up mankind's carbon emissions - is slowly losing its efficiency as a carbon sink due to largely unforseen climate feedbacks.
It's early days, but this first real-world measurement of a slowdown in the ocean's ability to dissolve carbon could have worrying implications for those currently thinking about how to stabilize atmospheric greenhouse levels.
The 2007 hurricane season is about to get officially underway.
Never mind that nature has already provided the first named storm in the North Atlantic: Andrea.
Several forecasts suggest that the 2007 season in the North Atlantic will be well above average.
Sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are above normal and atmospheric conditions look likely to be favorable for tropical storm activity.
In 2005, the record breaking year in the North Atlantic, record high SSTs in the critical region from 10 to 20 degrees N in the North Atlantic provided ample fuel for the 28 named storms (normal about 15, previous record 21 in 1933) and 15 hurricanes (normal about 6, previous record 12).
Atmospheric conditions were favorable with weak wind shear (that otherwise tends to tear a vortex apart) and the absence of stable layers that prevent convection from developing.
In contrast in 2006, SSTs were much lower and closer to the long term normal, and the atmospheric conditions were not favorable, as a developing El Niño in the Pacific created an atmospheric circulation that increased the wind shear in the Atlantic.
This year, in 2007, there is no El Niño in the Pacific, and SSTs and the upper ocean heat content are more favorable for Atlantic storms.
There seems to be general agreement on these points, yet the whole issue of Atlantic hurricanes is mired in controversy over the role of global warming.
It is not a disagreement that SSTs are higher but rather whether the warming is due to natural processes such as the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation or global warming.
To the public, the result is the same for now.
To me this is obvious: global warming is “unequivocal” to quote the recent IPCC Working Group I report and global SSTs have increased about 0.6 degrees C. In the last half century this warming is associated with increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
It is not possible that the Atlantic has escaped from this warming.
The latest shot fired on this issue was by Chris Landsea in Eos on the long term Atlantic hurricane record.
The Atlantic has the best record of tropical storms owing in part to aircraft surveillance since 1944.
It is widely recognized that the older records are less reliable as the reports depend on shipping or landfall of the storms.
Landsea makes this case quite well, but he goes further.
He assumes that the percentage of landfalling storms should be constant over time and this provides a basis for adjusting the older records and increasing the numbers of storms by 2.2 per year from 1900 to 1965, when the satellite era began.
The critical assumption is that this fraction should remain the same, yet it is abundantly clear that SSTs have increased and so other things have not remained the same.
Given the dependence of hurricanes on high SSTs above about 26 degrees C, shouldn’t increased SSTs increase the scope for storms to develop farther to the east over what were colder waters and for the tracks to become longer?
An example may be Vince in October 2005, which was the first tropical storm to make landfall in Spain and Portugal.
Indeed shouldn’t one expect a decreasing fraction of landfalling storms in a warming climate?
Our intention was, and remains, to provide readers with pointers to interesting climate news and informal summaries of the state of play on various topics.
We wanted, and still want, to offer a wide range of views, and to move beyond the natural sciences into the social sciences and the political world as and when necessary.
To this end we supplemented the various staff members at Nature , Nature Reports Climate Change and the nascent Nature Geoscience who can blog on this site with invited contributors, thinking of those who had responded to our invitations as our early “core contributors”.
We remain open to suggestions from you all about how to make the blog a useful addition to one of the world’s most pressing conversations.
We look forward to many fruitful discussions on climate change in our journals and others, in the news, and in the world at large.
Warnings that switching to biofuels as a ‘clean’ energy source could threaten food security and increase deforestation have become increasingly stark this week.
Today, BBC News reports on new study by the UK based Co-op Insurance Society that reiterates some of these concerns.
The CIS report warns of the potentially severe environmental impacts of increased biofuel production.
According to the BBC, the study found that as much as nine per cent of the world's agricultural land could be needed to replace just 10% of the world's transport fuels.
The land needed for energy crops could encroach on what little land is available for food in countries threatened by famine.
It does make sense to compare the per capita CO2 emissions of Mexico City and Los Angeles (see figure below) to illuminate the debate on shared but differentiated responsibilities on greenhouse gases emissions and show that just as urban centers register different levels and paths of economic development, cities do not contribute at the same level to global warming.
For instance, the real GDP per capita of Los Angeles (US$40,031) is almost 3 times that of Mexico City (US$13,470).
The paradox here is that many of those urban centers with almost negligible contributions to the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are more vulnerable to the negative impacts of climate change are.
One reason of this relates to the local level of expenditures per capita in Mexico City, which are similarly tiny when compared with those of Los Angeles.
In such conditions, the binding constraint for this and other cities of the developing world is the lack of economic resources from peoples’ taxes and of economic growth to deal with any component of the climate agenda.
I wrote a longish feature for Nature this week on geoengineering .
It goes into various details perhaps a little deeper than some accounts have, and of course also leaves out stuff that in an ideal world it would have got in.
The bottom line is that lowering the earth's average temperature by putting long-lived particles of some sort into the stratosphere is, as has long been known, technologically feasible, and would alter the course of, but not completely stop, climate change.
Crucially, as yet we cannot predict with any confidence what the net changes under a warming+cooling regime would be, and though there are signs they might be a little smaller than was once thought they could easily be large enough to be complete showstoppers.
The article gives, I think, full voice to the uncertainties and risks involved (though I suspect some will differ, especially since the article has served as a springboard for the AEI , which makes this comment peculiarly ironic).
What I did try and do, at least a little, was explore the reasons why many researchers don't even want to look at this issue.
There's a fairly widespread feeling that even studying it lends it a certain legitimacy, and that that legitimacy could be used as a rhetorical tool -- or even as a basis for real-world programs -- by people who have no interest in reducing CO2 emissions.
I can understand this as a position; people obviously have a right to avoid doing research that they believe will be misappropriated.
But that said I think that this view is at least somewhat on the wane.
One reason is Paul Crutzen 's intervention last year (see further discussion in the journal Climate Change ).
Another, I think, is increasing consciousness of ocean acidification , though this is speculation on my part, and didn't as I recall make it into the finished article.
Ocean acidification provides a really strong argument for cutting carbon dioxide emissions that geoengineering can do nothing about.
Its acknowledgement may thus, in a strange way, provide people with a license to speculate about such ideas, since it allows all such speculation to carry the firm proviso that even if you did try geoengineering, you'd have to cut emissions anyway -- that there's no either/or.
The conference was opened by Tim "Weather Maker" Flannery , which is a pretty big name for a new field to manage to attract, I'd have thought.
Here's an overview of the conference by Kelpie Wilson of the Energy Bulletin .
One interesting aspect is the idea of tying this issue to the issue of crappy stoves that drive indoor air pollution and waste a lot of energy.
As I mentioned we've a look at the subject in Nature this week, too -- a commentary ( pdf ) from one of the field's main men, Johannes Lehmann of Cornell, which takes things forward nicely, I think.
One of the advantages he points out for biochar sequestration -- as opposed, say, to sequestration of carbon in aquifers -- is that once the carbon is in the soil "it is difficult to imagine any incident or change in practise that would cause a sudden loss of stored carbon".
And he also argues that this sort of practise could be carried out at a serious scale:
I have calculated emissions reductions for three separate biochar approaches that can each sequester about 10% of the annual US fossil-fuel emissions (1.6 billion tonnes of carbon in 2005).
First, pyrolysis of forest residues (assuming 3.5 tonnes biomass per hectare per year) from 200 million hectares of US forests that are used for timber production; second, pyrolysis of fast-growing vegetation (20 tonnes biomass per hectare per year) grown on 30 million hectares of idle US cropland for this purpose; third, pyrolysis of crop residues (5.5 tonnes biomass per hectare per year) for 120 million hectares of harvested US cropland.
In each case, the biochar generated by pyrolysis is returned to the soil and not burned to offset fossil-fuel use.
Even greater emissions reductions are possible if pyrolysis gases are captured for bioenergy production.
Cities play key and diverse roles in the climate change arena.
Regarding mitigation, a high proportion of energy, industrial and transportation emissions is generated by urban areas.
Although most of the electricity and fuels are produced outside cities, they are aimed at satisfying cities’ “thirst” of energy.
Therefore, urban areas place a huge burden not only on the absorptive capacity of the local environment; they also influence wide patterns of energy and land use in the surrounding and more distant areas, in the livelihoods and quality of life of people living outside cities’ boundaries.
As of vulnerability and adaptation, urban centers concentrate a large proportion of coastal and other populations most at risk from the effects of climate change (IPCC Summary for Policy Makers).
The need for urban and local authorities and civil groups to develop actions to reduce greenhouse gases is part of the agenda of several cities in United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America (www.iclei.org).
Yet, the need to act to increase cities’ capacity to adapt to climate change and to understand the mechanisms to increase their resilience is not so well established, especially in developing countries.
The irony here is that many of the urban areas more vulnerable to the negative impacts of climate change are those with almost negligible contributions to the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
For instance, each citizen of Los Angeles emits an average of 15.6 tons CO2 e. These amounts are huge when compared to amounts in Mexico City, where each inhabitant releases four times less than in Los Angeles (3.6 tons CO2 e).
If we multiply the per capita numbers by the total population, then Los Angeles and Mexico City emit 234 and 64.8 million Tons per year respectively (See footnote 1).
At the same time, cities are centers of diverse kinds of innovations (including technological innovation) that may contribute to de-carbonizing our societies and making them more sustainable and resilient.
Only through the transformation of the infrastructure, especially transport, and the use of power in cities’ buildings, in the behavior, and in the production and consumption patterns of their residents, will it be possible to reduce greenhouse gases.
Furthermore, urban centers might cope with the impacts of climate related events by introducing changes in the availability of water and other natural resources, in environmental conditions, and in buildings characteristics.
There are examples of well governed cities, which have introduced actions to ensure the provision of infrastructure and services, and urban planning and management that reduces the vulnerability of people, industries and infrastructures.
Yet, those cases are exceptional, and adaptation practices which increase cities’ resilience are taking place on a very limited basis (IPCC Summary for Policy Makers).
Hunt, J.
(2004), “How can cities mitigate and adapt to climate change?, Building, research and information 32(1), p.55
With the IPCC reporting that greenhouse gas concentrations can be stabilized at an extremely small cost relative to global GDP, why should advocacy press right up to the scientific frontier where claims are most vigorously contested and knowledge most uncertain?
The case for mitigation is already strong without invoking hurricane damages.
And consider this: even if we simply assume that greenhouse gases have a large and immediate impact on hurricane intensities, there is little that mitigation efforts can do anyway to stem the ever-growing economic toll associated with hurricanes.
This week in Nature we have a news story on an attempt to follow up Frank Keppler's work on methane produced aerobically by green plants which we published early last year ( news story | paper ).
The Keppler piece, which suggested that methane emissions from green plants were a significant but previously unappreciated factor in global methane emissions, caused quit a lot of fuss, understandably, in the media -- since methane is a greenhouse gas which, over short time horizons, is about 75 times more powerful than carbon dioxide -- and quite a lot of befuddlement among plant scientists.
If it were true, it would have significant implications for the way that people model methane production, and the levels of production that one might predict in a warming world.
The debate rumbled on last year (another news report , this time by my colleague Quirin).
Both groups have criticized the other's choice of experimental method.
Dueck says that Keppler's group kept plants in sealed plastic containers instead of flow chambers, and exposed them to sources of stress such as bright sunlight and high temperature, which could have produced methane as an artefact.
Keppler retorts that the use of 13C is an artificial piece of chemical trickery with unknown effects on plant metabolism, and also argues that methane production can vary by up to three orders of magnitude between species.
On isoprene, this is as good a place as any to mention an interesting perspective by Manuel Lerdau in Science a few weeks ago on a possible isoprene-ozone positive feedback ( paper ).
Isoprene within leaves protects the plants that produce it against ozone.
But when isoprene gets out into the air, as it will, it can react with nitrogen oxides to make ozone.
Only some species produce isoprene, and so these isoprene-producing plants both protect themselves against ozone and, in Nox-rich environments, increase the ozone stress on their non-isoprene-producing neighbours.
Even the venerable New York Times is prone to completely botching a discussion of the science of climate change.
In a front page article today, the NYT reports on how the National Arbor Day Foundation has updated plant hardiness maps to reflect recent changes in climate.
(A plant hardiness map presents the lowest annual temperature as a guideline to what plants will thrive in what climate zones.
) The NYT misrepresents understandings of variability and trend and in the process confuse more than clarify.
The New York Times reports that these differences can all be attributed to human-caused climate change, using the case of Atlanta as an illustration:
Using data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Arbor Day map indicates that many bands of the country are a full zone warmer, and a few spots are two zones warmer, than they were in 1990, when the map was last updated.
The underlying issue has to do with understanding the role of human-caused climate change in the context of climate variability on long time scales.
The publication in 2004 was a remarkable event, because the hockey-stick had been elevated to an icon by the 3rd Assessment Report of the IPCC.
This perception was supported by a lack of healthy discussion about the method behind the hockey-stick.
In the years before, due to effective gate keeping of influential scientists, papers raising critical points had a hard time or even failed to pass the review process.
For a certain time, the problem was framed as an issue of mainstream scientists, supporting the concept of anthropogenic climate change, versus a group of skeptics, who doubted the reality of the blade of the hockey stick.
By framing it this way, the real problems, namely the ‘wobbliness’ of the shaft of the hockey-stick, and the suppressing of valid scientific questions by gate keeping, were left out.
Hopefully, sociology of science will later study this unfortunate period of climate science, but we may conclude now that science itself has indeed corrected claims of premature knowledge.
We see now a healthy and broad discussion of the issue.
We had the opportunity to respond to no less than four comments on our 2004 Science paper, but unfortunately only two comments were published.
Similarly, Michael Mann and his coworkers had to respond to at least 2 comments to their Journal of Climate article in 2005.
At the EGU General Assembly a few weeks ago there were no less than three papers from groups in Copenhagen and Bern assessing critically the merits of methods used to reconstruct historical climate variable from proxies; Bürger’s papers in 2005; Moberg’s paper in Nature in 2005; various papers on borehole temperature; The National Academy of Science Report from 2006 – al of which have helped to clarify that the hockey-stick methodologies lead indeed to questionable historical reconstructions.
The 4th Assessment Report of the IPCC now presents a whole range of historical reconstructions instead of favoring prematurely just one hypothesis as reliable.
When looking back we are satisfied with what has been achieved – namely an open, open-minded exciting discussion about the merits and problems related to different methods; an atmosphere where mere claims about the informational content of proxy-data meet a more critical response; an evolving practice of testing the skill of reconstruction methods in the laboratory of millennial forced global climate model simulations, where the formation of proxy-data is simulated in - so far too simplified - models.
The week before last, I was one of an army of geoscientists travelling to Vienna from Europe and the world for the General Assembly of the European Geophysical Union (EGU).
And of course, we are all aware of climate change.
There was a talk on “The carbon footprint of academic travelling – assessing the sustainability of different ways of travelling to the EGU Assembly”.
Too late, since most of us had already come by plane.

The extent of Arctic sea ice in August was the second lowest in the satellite record, according to a report issued today by the National Snow and Ice Data Center.
A week or so is left in the summer melt season.
So where will this year’s minimum fall compared to other years?
As of September 3, according to NSIDC, sea ice extent was the third lowest on record , behind 2007 and 2008.
So it will be interesting to see where we wind up once the point of maximum melting is reached.
The Fourmile Canyon fire blazing in the foothills of Rockies just west of Boulder has burned more than 3,500 acres and prompted the evacuation of more than 3,500 people.
At least a dozen homes have burned, including those of four firefighters.
Boulder County officials say it could be several days before the fire is contained.
The fire with its long, arcing smoke plume is evident from space, as the satellite images below from the Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies reveal.
Click on each one for an animated time-lapse loop of imagery.

The smoke plume from the Fourmile Canyon fire just west of Boulder, Colorado streams eastward for almost 100 miles on Sept. 6th.
As hurricane Earl sweeps up the East Coast, threatening the most densely populated part of the country, possible links between global warming and tropical cyclones are already being explored by journalists.
The first story I’ve found is by Seth Borenstein of the Associated Press.
WASHINGTON — Pushed by an ill-timed trough of low pressure, Hurricane Earl is heading uncomfortably close to an area relatively few hurricanes tend to go: the Northeast coastline.
And Earl may be foreshadowing more northerly big storms to come with global warming, two hurricane experts said Thursday.
The idea is that global warming should cause sea surface temperatures to rise.
And since the energy stored in the surface waters of the ocean fuels hurricanes, there should be increases in hurricanes with global warming.
So far, so good.
But how well have scientists really pinned down this link?
It turns out that according to one of the world’s foremost experts on the subject, the picture is more complicated than scientists previously thought.
With Hurricane Earl bearing down on the Outer Banks of North Carolina earlier today, it attained winds of 140 miles per hour, putting it in the record books.
Jeff Masters reports in his WunderBlog that this makes it the third strongest hurricane on record to make it this far north in U.S. coastal waters.
Only Hurricane Esther of 1961 and Hurricane Connie of 1955 made it farther north in U.S. coastal waters at a higher strength.
Both storms had winds 5 mph stronger than Earl–145 mph.
One other Atlantic hurricane was stronger than Esther and Connie at a more northerly latitude–the second storm of 1922 , which had winds of 150 mph.
However, this hurricane was far out at sea, north of Bermuda.
Since Masters’ post, Earl has weakened.
As of 5 p.m. Eastern time, it was packing maximum sustained winds of 115 miles per hour, according to the National Hurricane Center , making it a Category 3 hurricane.
It is expected to weaken further, “but Earl is expected to remain a large and strong hurricane as it passes near the Outer Banks.”
Earl’s predicted track would keep its eye offshore of North Carolina, but Masters reports that hurricane force winds are still possible for the Outer Banks.
A small deviation in Earl’s track to the left, resulting in a direct hit on eastern Long Island and Providence, Rhode Island, would probably be a $10+ billion disaster, as the hurricane would hit a heavily populated area and drive a 7 - 15 foot storm surge up Buzzards Bay and Narragansett Bay.
The odds of this occurring are around 3%, according to the latest NHC wind probability forecast .
The forecast is calling for a 28% chance of hurricane-force winds on Nantucket, 7% in Providence, 4% in Boston, 7% in Eastport, Maine, and 17% in Hyannis.
As Hurricane Earl’s eyewall descended on it early this morning, a weather buoy east of the Bahamas busily recorded data about the conditions it was experiencing and relayed that information to shore.
At 2:50 a.m., when Earl’s greatest fury was focused on Station 41046, the storm was listed as a Category 4 hurricane — which indicates sustained winds of 131 to 155 miles per hour.
Yet the peak wind reading of 96 miles per hour sent back by the buoy wasn’t nearly that cataclysmic.
Here in Boulder, at the foot of the Rockies, we occasionally experience gusts that high as our fabled Chinook winds race downward toward the plains from the mountain peaks.
Hurricane Earl is now on the cusp of beginning its sweep up the Eastern Seaboard of the United States.
One forecast model, NOGAPS , has Earl’s western eyewall hitting North Carolina’s Outer Banks at about 2 a.m. Friday, and then Nantucket, Massachusetts about 24 hours later.
The prediction is that it will be Category 1 or 2 hurricane by then.
This is the worst case scenario, since other models place Earl a little farther to the east.
That said, damages from this hurricane could be severe.
Earlier today, Roger Pielke, Jr. posted an update in which he noted that Hurricane Edna’s track up the coast in 1954 looks very similar to that predicted for Earl.
That storm caused $3.7 billion in normalized damage, Pielke says.
And another hurricane with a similar track caused $10 billion in normalized damage in 1944.
Of course, in addition to Earl’s track, much will depend on how much strength Earl retains when it gets to cooler, more northerly waters.
No surprise here — with the exception of the Northwest and much of California, August was anomalously warm in most of the United States, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .
Over the next couple of weeks, a number of climatic updates for August will be issued by NOAA and NASA.
And the National Snow and Ice Data Center will probably issue its next analysis of Arctic sea ice within a few days.
I’ll be following it all here.
This one has apparently broken free from the Ward Hunt Ice Shelf on Ellesmere Island in Canada.
It’s about the size of Bermuda — much smaller the gargantuan chunk of ice that broke off the Petermann Glacier in Greenland, creating an “ice island” larger than Manhattan.
But according to NASA , this is still a significant event because it looks like the Ward Hunt ice has been in place for as many as 6,800 years.
And it won’t be reforming any time soon.
The satellite images below, from NASA’s Earth Observatory , show the ice as it looked a little earlier in August, and eight years ago for comparison.
Note the fractures just to the east and northeast of Ward Hunt Island, as compared to the image shot in 2002.
Also note the ice free fjords in the more recent image.
NASA points out that while the ice shelf seems larger to the west-northwest, it’s actually not.
Most of what you see is floating sea ice frozen to the shelf, not part of the actual ice shelf itself.
In it’s most recent analysis , the Climate Prediction Center of the National Weather Service noted developing La Niña conditions, with cool sea surface temperature anomalies strengthening across the central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean.
In an interview in the Guardian yesterday, the “skeptical environmentalist,” Bjørn Lomborg , said that global warming is ”undoubtedly one of the chief concerns facing the world today” and “a challenge humanity must confront.”
In a book to be published in September, he also says the world could solve climate change by investing $100 billion per year.
“Bjørn Lomborg, the self-styled “sceptical environmentalist” once compared to Adolf Hitler by the UN’s climate chief, is famous for attacking climate scientists, campaigners, the media and others for exaggerating the rate of global warming and its effects on humans, and the costly waste of policies to stop the problem.”
Yesterday wasn’t a particularly good day for Pachauri.
The InterAcademy Council, an organisation of world science bodies, released its long-awaited report on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, calling for fundamental reforms.
The IAC called for more transparency, greater openness to differing views, and greater care in avoiding policy prescriptions.
It also called for the IPCC to limit the term of its head to six years, the time required to produce one assessment report.
Meanwhile, Joe Romm — whom Time magazine has dubbed a “Hero of the Environment” and “the world’s most influential climate blogger” — was MIA on the IPCC review for almost a day.
This morning, he has finally posted a 660-word analysis .
Compare that to his 5,000-word attack piece on Andrew Revkin (featuring quotes from a blogger who say he has received letters from Wiley Coyote ) two days ago.
Here was Romm’s headline: “What’s the difference between climate science and climate journalism?”
Well, here’s another headline worth considering: “What’s the difference between climate activism and climate journalism?”
For only the fourth time in recorded history, sea ice has melted enough for the fabled Northwest Passage to open.
At the same time, the Northeast Passage along the northern coast of Russia has been openning intermittently as well.
A few weeks ago, the National Snow and Ice Data Center noted that sea ice was melting rapidly from the area of the Northwest Passage.
(Also see my post about it here .
) Now, as we approach the end of the melt season in the Arctic, the passage has opened for the fourth consecutive year.
It is now possible to completely circumnavigate the Arctic Ocean in ice-free waters, and this will probably be the case for at least a month.
This year marks the third consecutive year–and the third time in recorded history–that both the Northwest Passage and Northeast Passage have melted free, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center.
The Northeast Passage opened for the first time in recorded history in 2005, and the Northwest Passage in 2007.
It now appears that the opening of one or both of these northern passages is the new norm, and business interests are taking note–commercial shipping in the Arctic is on the increase, and there is increasing interest in oil drilling.
The great polar explorers of past centuries would be astounded at how the Arctic has changed in the 21st century.
As a followup to my earlier post on the possible connection between global warming and the Russian heat wave, I’ve been trying to catch up with Martin Hoerling .
Marty is a research meteorologist, specializing in climate dynamics, in NOAA’s Earth System Research Laboratory located here in Boulder, Colorado.
First, though, I must give credit where credit is due: This morning, Andrew Revkin wrote about a report from the Climate Science Investigation team, or CSI, a group at NOAA that Hoerling heads.
As Revkin reported today, back on August 13 CSI published a draft report online concluding that a natural phenomenon called “atmospheric blocking” was the principal cause of the extreme heat in western Russia.
The CSI group found no evidence that the long-lasting and astonishingly intense heat wave was caused by global warming.
[UPDATE 8/25 11:30 a.m.: Kevin Trenberth of the National Center for Atmospheric Research emailed me today to say that he disagreed with Hoerling on this issue.
I will try to interview him soon.
In the meantime, check out this document from a recent workshop on attribution of climate events.
]
When we say ‘principally’ we’re certainly not saying that [the blocking phenomenon] was the only cause.
And rarely in climate and weather is there a single silver bullet that says this is caused by that .
. .
So principally what we’re saying when we use that word is that this event, the block, explains the majority of the temperature conditions that developed at the surface, but it may not explain all of it .
. .
So this would be your 800 pound gorilla, but there are still some other weights to be thrown around.
Update 8/23: I replaced the original global image with this close up of the North Atlantic.
It depicts the formation of Danielle more clearly, and also doesn’t take as long to load!
Second update, morning of 8/24: According to the National Hurricane Center , the second wave of low pressure flowing out of Africa — in the wake of Hurricane Danielle — stands a 90 percent chance of itself becoming hurricane.
Third update, evening of 8/24: The hurricane center has downgraded Danielle to a tropical storm.
Literally in its wake, the second wave of low pressure is still estimated to have a 90 percent chance of becoming a hurricane.
On the subject of hurricanes, I interviewed Judith Curry of Georgia Tech today for a future radio spot.
“Everybody was predicing a very active hurricane season, but so far we haven’t seen very much at all,” she said.
This has partially been the result of the blocking pattern thought principally responsible for the heat wave in Russia .
According to Curry, it has also made the atmosphere dry in the tropical North Atlantic region.
“But now that blocking pattern has broken, so we may see hurricane activity resume, and in fact we have already seen it with Hurricane Daniellle.”
Fourth update, 10:30 a.m. 8/25: Danielle is now a hurricane again, and now a third wave of low pressure is flowing out of Africa.
See Jeff Masters’ Wunderground.com blog for more details.
Note: This will be the last update on this post.

The animation above shows the evolution of “total precipitable water” in the North Atlantic over the course of 72 hours, ending this evening (August 23) Boulder time.
I offer it here simply because I think it is impossibly cool — and beautiful.
And for one other reason: It shows the development of the second Atlantic hurricane of the season, Hurricane Danielle.
More about that in a minute.
But first, what are we looking at here, and what’s “total precipitable water”?
Earth has done an ecological about-face: Global plant productivity that once flourished under warming temperatures and a lengthened growing season is now on the decline, struck by the stress of drought.
“These results are extraordinarily significant because they show that the global net effect of climatic warming on the productivity of terrestrial vegetation need not be positive — as was documented for the 1980’s and 1990’s,” said Diane Wickland, of NASA Headquarters and manager of NASA’s Terrestrial Ecology research program.
Barton, an 11-term Republican from Texas, is chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and one of the oil lobby's best friends on Capitol Hill.
Late last month he fired off letters to professor Michael Mann of the University of Virginia and two other scientists demanding information about what he claimed were "methodological flaws and data errors" in their studies of global warming.
The scientists' offense was that they had authored a controversial study that reported a sharp rise in global temperatures during the 20th century, based on an analysis of tree rings, glacial ice and coral layers.
The study was an important source for a 2001 report by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that argued the 1990s had been the hottest decade in 1,000 years.
A graph summarizing the sharp upturn last century after hundreds of years of flat temperatures became known as the "hockey stick," and it has been derided ever since by skeptics.
There's certainly room for scientific debate about Mann's research.
A front-page article in the Wall Street Journal on Feb. 14 cited a rebuttal by two Canadian scientists, focusing on Mann's alleged mathematical mistakes.
But other scientists have noted that there is so much other evidence of global warming that even if Mann did make serious mistakes in his statistical calculations, it wouldn't change the scientific picture very much.
"[I]ndependent groups, with different analysis methods, have arrived at similar results for the last millennium," climatologists Gavin Schmidt and Stefan Rahmstorf argue in a post on their Web site, RealClimate.org.
Barton's goal wasn't scientific clarity but political intimidation.
That was the conclusion of Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, a New York Republican who chairs the House Committee on Science, which also claims jurisdiction on climate change issues.
He wrote a blistering July 14 letter to Barton: "My primary concern about your investigation is that its purpose seems to be to intimidate scientists rather than to learn from them, and to substitute Congressional political review for scientific peer review.
This would be pernicious.
" He added that the precedent set by this effort "to have Congress put its thumbs on the scales of a scientific debate" was "truly chilling.
"
The political mischief in Barton's probe is that it tries to fuzz the climate debate when a consensus is finally emerging that climate change is a serious global problem and one that is man-made.
The national academies of science of 11 leading countries, including the United States and Britain, issued a joint declaration this year that "there is now strong evidence that significant global warming is occurring" and that the "scientific understanding of climate change is now sufficiently clear to justify nations taking prompt action.
"
This growing scientific consensus prompted a "sense of the Senate" resolution last month that "greenhouse gases accumulating in the atmosphere are causing average temperatures to rise at a rate outside the range of natural variability," and that the problem is caused by "human activity.
" Another sign of the scientific clarity on the issue came yesterday when the Senate energy committee met with top climatologists and then expressed bipartisan support for taking action.
Even President Bush agreed that the scientific evidence is solid by endorsing a Group of Eight communique this month that described climate change as "a serious and long-term challenge" and warning that human activities "contribute in large part to increases in greenhouse gases associated with the warming of our Earth's surface.
"
The strategy of Exxon Mobil and other business interests that resist action on global warming has been to maintain the notion that the scientific evidence is shaky.
That strategy was outlined in a remarkable 1998 "Action Plan" prepared by business opponents of the Kyoto treaty, which argued: "Victory will be achieved when .
. .
average citizens 'understand' (recognize) uncertainties in climate science.
"
Barton's investigation may be a last roundhouse swing in this bash-the-science strategy.
Perhaps it pleased energy and natural resource interests, which gave Barton $523,099 in his 2004 congressional race, and Exxon Mobil, which has given him $17,500 since 2001.
But this battle is ending.
A consensus is emerging among responsible Republicans and Democrats.
The basic science on climate change isn't in doubt any more.
The question is what to do about it.
The cap-and-trade law that is solving the acid rain problem is a very rare species: an unmitigated public policy triumph.
Sulfur dioxide emitted by power plants has been cut in half at a fraction of the predicted cost.
Now, nearly two decades after that landmark bill, cap-and-trade is again taking center stage -- this time in the context of climate change legislation.
Last month, the House of Representatives passed legislation authored by Reps. Henry Waxman (D-CA) and Ed Markey (D-MA) that would use a cap-and-trade system to achieve deep cuts in the greenhouse gases that are causing global warming.
The action now moves to the Senate, where Majority Leader Harry Reid has pledged to move similar legislation this fall.
The current momentum for serious climate change legislation should be a cause for celebration among environmentalists.
And to be sure, most major environmental groups, including Environmental Defense Fund, have championed the Waxman-Markey bill and the cap-and-trade approach it relies on.
Yet despite the proven success of cap and trade, we are already hearing from critics that cap and trade is a giveaway to polluters and ineffective to boot.
Critics then argue either that we should tax carbon instead (if they are serious about global warming) or charge that cap-and-trade is just a tax in disguise (if they seek to sabotage it).
Here are four reasons why cap and trade not only differs from a tax, but is a superior, more effective means to slow and eventually halt global warming.
Environmental certainty.
Let's keep our eyes on the prize: avoiding dangerous climate change.
Emissions need to start declining fast enough in the US, as well as other countries with large emissions, in order to avoid warming that would cause ice sheets to disintegrate, drought to become endemic, and killer heat waves to become the norm.
Global warming exceeding 3-4 degrees Fahrenheit would cause such risks to increase markedly.
The Waxman-Markey target of a 17% cut below 2005 levels by 2020, and 83% by 2050, can help avoid the danger zone, assuming other countries act quickly, too.
A legally binding cap is the only way to assure that this emissions objective will actually be attained.
International opportunity.
The atmosphere is indifferent to where carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, is emitted.
So long as overall emissions come down, warming is kept in check.
But while the benefit from reducing a ton of emissions in Boston or Bali or Beijing is the same, the cost varies widely.
The "trade" in cap and trade saves money by allowing companies to take advantage of such differences.
Many of the most cost-effective abatement opportunities are in the developing world.
The ultimate goal, once countries like China and Brazil have adequate systems for monitoring their emissions, is a global carbon market -- benefiting both the developing countries that would reduce emissions and sell the resulting credits, and the industrialized countries that would buy them.
Political viability.
In our view, cap and trade is the best policy on the merits.
But it is also the politically viable path.
The Waxman-Markey legislation builds on a blueprint put together by the U.S. Climate Action Partnership (USCAP), a broad coalition of businesses and environmental groups.
Meanwhile, a recent survey shows that of all regulatory approaches, the public likes taxes least.
A key political advantage is that this cap and trade program provides a built-in, flexible mechanism to compensate for higher energy costs -- either directly (via free allocation of emission permits) or indirectly (dispensing the revenue from auctioning permits).
Much has been made of the supposed "corporate giveaways" in the Waxman-Markey bill.
But in fact, if the bill favors any single group it is households: over the span of the program, more than forty percent of the total value of emission permits, through a combination of reductions in utility bills and tax rebates, would go to households.
That amounts to a present value of more than half a trillion dollars going directly to American families.
If that's a giveaway, we'll take it.
In contrast, just over twenty percent of the permit value would go to industry, with another twenty percent funding public purposes such as investing in energy efficiency and helping communities and ecosystems adapt to a warming climate.
(The remainder goes to small businesses and deficit reduction.
)
When they're out of ammunition, critics often resort to the claim that cap and trade is too complicated and subject to gaming, while taxes are simpler.
They somehow overlook the fact that the U.S. tax code is over 16,000 pages long -- or that every time Congress has tried to "simplify" taxes, the loopholes and exemptions have wormed their way back in, an outcome aided and abetted by highly-paid lobbyists and then implemented by high-priced lawyers.
Not to mention the fact that the acid rain cap and trade program has a 99% compliance rate -- something that the IRS could only dream of.
Some environmental advocates complain that the Waxman-Markey bill is imperfect.
And it is imperfect -- just like any legislation that contains the compromises necessary to get it passed.
But a focus on the flaws completely misses what a monumental shift the Waxman-Markey bill would set into motion.
Cap-and-trade succeeded in the acid rain case because it fundamentally restructured the incentives faced by industry: companies could no longer freely pollute the atmosphere, so they figured out new ways of producing electricity with less pollution.
A cap-and-trade system for carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases -- pervasive throughout our economy -- will restructure incentives on a much grander scale -- tipping the balance toward low-carbon, high-efficiency technologies, and rewarding entrepreneurs and innovators who develop the next generation of clean technologies.
In contrast to the success of cap and trade in addressing acid rain, the federal government has never used a tax to control a large-scale pollution problem.
The window of opportunity to avoid a dangerous warming is closing fast.
We can't afford the time to tinker with a tax.
Let's rely on a proven approach, and cap greenhouse gases.
The 1,400 page American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 does not contain a revenue neutral carbon dioxide emission fee.
The America’s Energy Security Trust Fund Act of 2009 implements a gradually increasing fee on carbon dioxide emissions in 17 pages, with revenue neutral rebates.
Why not incorporate a revenue neutral carbon dioxide emission fee into the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009?
And here's one good reason NOT to use cap-and-trade: A trillion dollar, volatile, derivitized carbon market could crash the financial markets again, and put environmental protection on the back burner for a very long time.
I could not disagree more.
And while I applaud all efforts to stem the tide of global warming, Waxman-Markey gave so much away that it's meaningless.
Here's to hoping that the Senate examines the alternatives to cap and trade--including a revenue-neutral carbon tax.
Cap and trade cannot be sold on its face, in my opinion.
The lobbyists who arranged the "Comprehensive Climate Bill" had it best--hide it among many other good sounding things like dreams of solar panels and windmills and the millions of new workers fixing them, because these jobs cannot be outsourced from Americans.
(that is until a "Comprehensive Immigration Bill" is passed to solve that)
I used to be on board with the idea that C02 causes global warming.
But there is a lot of evidence that is not the case and the manmade global warming theory is a big hoax.
First, any argument that tries to use a regional phenomenon to disprove a global trend is dead in the water.
Anthropogenic global warming theory does not predict uniform warming throughout the globe.
We need to assess the balance of the evidence .
In the case of this particular region, there is actually very little data about the changes in the ice sheets.
The growth in the East Antarctic ice sheet indicated by some evidence is so small, and the evidence itself so uncertain, the sheet may well be shrinking.
But even this weak piece of evidence may no longer be current.
Some recent results from NASA's GRACE experiment, measuring the gravitational pull of the massive Antarctic ice sheets, have indicated that on the whole, ice mass is being lost.
Second, ice-sheet thickening is not inconsistent with warming!
Warmer climates tend toward more precipitation.
The Antarctic is one of the most extreme deserts on the planet.
As it warms, we would expect it to receive more snow.
But even a whopping warming of 20 degrees -- say, from -50 degrees C to -30 degrees C -- would still leave it below freezing, so the snow wouldn't melt.
Thus, an increase in ice mass.
While on the subject of ice sheets: Greenland is also growing ice in the center, for the same reasons described above.
But it is melting on the exterior regions, on the whole losing approximately 200 km3 of ice annually, doubled from just a decade ago .
This is a huge amount compared to changes in the Antarctic -- around three orders of magnitude larger.
So in terms of sea-level rise, any potential mitigation due to East Antarctic Ice Sheet growth is wiped out many times over by Greenland's melting.
We are truly fortunate that climatic changes are highly buffered, and change, even though it is accelerating at a great pace, is nevertheless a slow process for human beings.
Insidiously slow.
Let me get this straight... A global drought is causing cooling?
Which is recorded as globing warming because drier air contains fewer clouds, therefore letting more sunlight in and warming the air?
So what we perceive as warm temperatures are actually cooler.
And as the air further cools and loses moisture, it will get warmer?
But this is because it is getting cooler.
Deserts>> And as the air further cools and loses moisture, it will get warmer?
But this is because it is getting cooler.
>>
So if that region of land was not a desert, then with clouds, both maximum(down) and minimum(up) air temperatures would be moderated.
Now because there are no clouds, the desert land has actually warmed, but the air is less hot that it would be if...... both land and air are just gaining a no weather temperature,
But to us the desert is both much warmer and colder.
The ground may approach 90 or more degrees centigrade, the air 50C during the day, at night there could be frost formed from the little water in the air.
You may now appreciate, when you don't know what is happening, the initial climatic picture can be very confusing.
Remove water vapour and we travel towards a Moon climate.
We may only know this once we arrive.
This is not good enough.
All we are saying is that Yes, It's Hotter than in the past 200 years.
Agreed. Yes, we should not "pollute".
Agreed. But is CO2 the main driver of global warming?
We need to know more!
Having your ice and eating it"Second, ice-sheet thickening is not inconsistent with warming!
Warmer climates tend toward more precipitation.
The Antarctic is one of the most extreme deserts on the planet.

But even a whopping warming of 20 degrees -- say, from -50 degrees C to -30 degrees C -- would still leave it below freezing, so the snow wouldn't melt.

"
So, glaciers melt, this is evidence for (or at least not against) global warming.
Antarctica gets bigger - this is also evidence for global warming.
What could happen that ISN'T evidence for global warming?
Any chance of any predictive hypotheses that could be verified in the future?
Antrctic Ice is GrowingIs it really all that unclear whether Antarctic ice is increasing or decreasing?
Please note the following:
"And down south last September, NASA satellites showed the Antarctic Ice Field to be the largest it has ever been in the 30 years it has been observed by satellite (based on an analysis of 347 million radar altimeter measurements made by the European Space Agency's ERS-1 and ERS-2 satellites).
"
This is from an anti global warming site:
TheKidSalamiNo, no-one has ever said that increasing ice mass in the Antarctic is evidence for global warming.
They have just said that it is not inconsistent with global warming.
That is, increasing ice mass in one area of the globe proves and disproves nothing about the global climate, especially while evidence from elsewhere (ie.
everywhere with ice) means that the general trend of global ice levels are downwards.
Americans fall into six distinct groups regarding their climate change beliefs, attitudes and behaviors, according to a new report, “Global Warming’s Six Americas,” by researchers at Yale and George Mason universities.
The researchers, who surveyed 2,129 American adults last fall, found that these “six Americas” include:
The Alarmed (18 percent of American adults) are the most convinced that global warming is happening, caused by humans and poses a serious and urgent threat to people in the United States and future generations.
They rate global warming as a very high national priority and strongly support a variety of climate change policies, such as regulating CO2 as a pollutant.
The Concerned (33 percent) believe global warming is a serious problem and support an active national response, but, compared to the Alarmed, rate it as personally less important and have taken fewer actions to save energy at home or on the road.
They do, however, express a willingness to make purchasing decisions based on whether companies are enacting or opposing steps to reduce global warming.
The Cautious (19 percent) are somewhat convinced that global warming is happening, but say they could change their minds.
They have only thought a little about the issue, do not consider it personally important and tend not to worry about it, largely because they believe the impacts won’t occur for at least 35 years.
The Disengaged (12 percent) are not at all sure global warming is happening and have not thought much about the issue.
Only a third believes that global warming is caused by human activities, and they overwhelmingly say they simply don’t know whether global warming will harm future generations.
The Doubtful (11 percent) say they don’t know whether global warming is happening or not, but if it is, it is caused by natural environmental changes and won’t harm people in the United States for at least 100 years.
The Dismissive (7 percent) are sure that global warming is not happening, thus they do not worry about it or support most policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
They do, however, support several policies that help individuals save energy, like tax rebates for people who purchase energy efficient vehicles or solar panels.
“When we talk about ‘the American public’ and its views on global warming, that’s a misnomer,” said Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale F&ES Project on Climate Change and a co-author of the report.
“There is no single American voice on this issue.”
“Too many climate-change education and awareness campaigns have been like throwing darts in a dark room,” said Leiserowitz.
“Climate change is ultimately a human problem.
If we want to constructively engage Americans in the solutions, we have to first know our audience.”
The study was conducted by the Yale F&ES Project on Climate Change and the George Mason University Center for Climate Change Communication.
It was funded by the Yale Center for Environmental Law & Policy, The Betsy and Jesse Fink Foundation, the Surdna Foundation, the 11th Hour Project, The Pacific Foundation and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
We’ve often been asked to provide a one stop link for resources that people can use to get up to speed on the issue of climate change, and so here is a first cut.
Unlike our other postings, we’ll amend this as we discover or are pointed to new resources.
Different people have different needs and so we will group resources according to the level people start at.
There is a new booklet on Climate Literacy from multiple agencies (NOAA, NSF, AAAS) available here ( pdf ).
I don’t see NOAA or NOAA’s NWS mentioned.
Does anyone feel they have enough courage, moral obligation and know how to stand up to two generals and a Vice Admiral?
– to see that they are held accountable for their wrong doing on global warming?
What I’ve been looking for is a site that actively debunks Steve McIntyre’s ClimateAudit site.
I’ve noticed that climate scientists rarely link to him.
On his site, he appears to make some very serious allegations about the integrity of the IPCC process, and is still engaged in fighting the hockey stick (and now, spaghetti) wars.
Hi, I don’t mean to turn this into yet another sceptic thread, but I’ve read in another site that there apparently are doubts about current models assuming that climate sensitivity is constant.
(Do they indeed assume this?
)
Also, the individual asserts that control systems theory has not been properly addressed in the current models, and that some climate scientists who have properly accounted for this have doubts about the current models.
I’m not a climate scientist, just an interested layperson, and I thought I’d seen all the sceptic arguments, but this is a new one for me.
Would appreciate any reply.
Thanks!
Basically, you really don’t even need to believe in global warming to want to live more efficiently, right?
I mean, it’s the right thing to do for many other critical reasons.
Apart from improving our health:
It improves our national security.
Oil could spike to $5.00 a gallon tomorrow if something happened in the Middle East or a hurricane hit Huston.
If that happened, the economy and our security would be greatly weakened, Duh!
Living more efficiently ultimately lowers our impact on wildlife and forest areas in the form of less acid rain, fewer catastrophic oil spills, and less strip mining.
Finally, if we can become more energy self-sufficient on a very local level we become that much less vulnerable to region-wide disasters like Hurricanes or mass blackouts.
In this regard, renewable energy, isn’t just good for the environment.
It’s also the key to keeping the power on when everybody else is sitting in the dark.
A couple months ago I was looking for a really simple graph showing the ice core CO2 measurements with the modern day rise superimposed on it to show to a contrarian.
An easy resource for any of the simple but powerful graphs that the science has produced (some of which simply don’t appear within the IPCC reports in a way that is presentable to the public) could be useful.
Hey I was wondering what anyone thought of this article: http://thenewsroom.com/details/329988/Business?c_id=adm It’s kind of interesting and it makes you think about global warming from an economic standpoint.
Do you think anyone in the United States government might be into this type of thing?
How does stuff like this affect the energy crisis?
Great infomative site!
Just heard of the huge chunk of the artic that recently broke off..bloody scary!!
Hey guys..australia has invented new solar cell technology called ’sliver’ cells – 15x more efficient than the current ones and flexible too.
In production within 18 months -2 years.
What this means is that the avearage family house can be producing 30Kw+ at the same price as a normal 2Kw solar system.
and it uses 99% less silicon than conventional ones as well!
There are ways to reverse global warming..all it takes is people to be aware of their options and to apply the blowtorch to their respective governments.
Just take a minute to think of all the possibilities that this new technology promises.
Flexible–so the bonnet and hood of your car can be made of sliver cells and that will supply more than enough power to it’s electric motor for even the most blaze speed freak to raise a sweat over.
It’s time to stop talking about what we are going to do and get in there and damn well DO-IT!!!!
I know I am!!
Hope this has been an inspiration.
Compend’s a good move, I think.
Within the last few days I’ve read in news services of Dr. Mike Raupach ’s and Dr. Pep Canadell’s report for the Aussie CSIRO Global Carbon Project that emissions have intensified and carbon-loading of the atmosphere has increased near or beyond IPCC worst-case scenarios.
No Hank Roberts-style adept at net linkages, I google Steve Rintoul and other ocean-sniffers from time to time.
Thank you for permitting me to gum crumbs from the high table.
Great post – thanks!
One thing you could add to it and maintain over time would be a list of climate focused blogs.
Many of us maintain links to other blogs with a climate change focus and this helps create community and spread awareness.
Since you’ve got a good following and are well respected, maintaining a clearing house list of such blogs in this this post would be a great community service.
I’m reminded of a scene from the play “Greater Tuna”, a very funny play that revolves around the only radio station in the town of Tuna, Texas.
In one scene, the Station Manager is interviewing a “concerned citizen” who is advocating the removal of several books from the Library.
One book that is subject to his wrath is “Uncle Tom’s Cabin”.
When asked why, he replies incredulously, “Why, it only presents one side of the slavery issue.” There are some issues that only have one side, and the science of climate change is such an issue.
Lawrence, that is bloody amazing.
I found a good blurb on it here .
5 to 7 years to recoup the cost of your solar panel instead of 20 as is the case with current solar voltaic products on offer!
And they’ll be mass-produced and flooding the market within a couple years.
Great list of resources, thanks.
Here’s another one, which I guess could go under “Informed, but in need of more detail” – here at http://environmentalresearchweb.org we’re providing free updates on the latest research in climate change and other environmental change topics as well as on potential solutions such as renewable energy.
The Royal Society [UK] has: Climate change controversies: a simple guide at: http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/page.asp?id=6229 .
New Scientist magazine has: Climate change: A guide for the perplexed at: http://environment.newscientist.com/channel/earth/climate-change/dn11462 .
Grist has How to Talk to a Climate Skeptic at: http://gristmill.grist.org/skeptics .
I particulalry like dthe entry explaining about the Vinland ‘grapes’.
It is anecdotes like this which impress the non-scientists and make them think that perhaps the sceptics are on to something after all.
Someone mentioned the EdGCM model you can download and run.
Perhaps better for beginners is Ben Matthews’ Java climate module , which is interactive and lets you play around with various parameters in realtime.
Also mentioned previously on this site is Kerry Emanuel’s Phaeton’s Reins , which is one of the best introductory essays on climate change I’ve read.
broach global warming as an issue.
The wrong person was fired.
according to a climate study that describes a runaway-train
“U.S.
aims to stop G8’s tough push on global warming.
on a new deal to fight global warming after the Kyoto
Also, many people I know, that are reasonable and intelligent, but not necessarily interested in the details of Global Warming were easily swayed by the Swindle Show (“The Great Global Warming Swindle”).
Their comments were along the lines of: “very powerful” or “more controversial than I thought” or even “opened my eyes.” All that happened was a few of the usual suspects (the same handful of skeptics) were paraded about, more or less, they made they same tired old (or debunked) arguments, displayed a graph or few, and correlated environmental-ism, as an -ism, that is actual “junk science” that can hurt the impoverished world (like Africa, etc).
I am a little confused and disheartened by the fact that – a few hands can be waved about, a few spurious arguments can be made, and one only needs say “it’s actually too complex a system and the debate over what is driving the Climate is still wide open to debate, at this time.” Why is the rhetoric of claiming it is more, or too, complex, and it is still wide open to debate – so effective?
Actually, I do think an aspect of creationism (something along “intelligent design”, except the fundamentalists have co-opted that phrase — now I don’t know what to call it) should be taught, or at least mentioned — but probably in Physics, not Biology.
Just like I think Fred Hoyle’s et al version of the “start” of the Universe ought to be mentioned along side the Big Bang theory.
Just like I think meterology and climatics (neat new word?!
) courses out to at least describe the skeptic side.
A beginner’s page shouldn’t use anacronyms like IPCC, AR4 and TAR without saying what they mean like International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
Good points Tim.
Nearly everyone in here has known for years that climate change is happening in the Upper Midwest.
NOAA NWS supervisors told the public, for many years, that global warming wasn’t happening or was not a problem.
They were ordered to tell national media during the summer flood of 1993 not to bring up global warming while doing national interviews.
Would we be better off if NWS did make global warming an issue in 1993 and afterwards?
I think so.
In 1989, American environmentalist Bill McKibben wrote a book about climate change, for ordinary people.
In The End of Nature, McKibben sounded one of the first warnings that the industrial age was altering Earth and argued that unless greenhouse gas emissions were cut back, the planet would change irrevocably.
“I wrote The End of Nature and thought, 'People will read this and be all set,'” he says.
Governments would limit greenhouse gas emissions.
Citizens would change their expectations.
Some 20 years later, the global average temperature is still rising.
So it's perhaps unsurprising that McKibben's latest book, eerily titled Eaarth, reflects a darker view.
In Eaarth, McKibben writes that now it's clear Earth will never be the same; it ought to be renamed.
The release of these books, both out this month, has been timed well, given that the geoengineering genie is now out of the bottle, as climate modeler Raymond Pierrehumbert puts it in Kintisch’s Hack the Planet.
Just last month, experts met for the first time – at the Asilomar conference centre in Monterey, California – to consider how the field can be regulated.
Meanwhile, governments are holding parliamentary hearings on the subject and venture capitalists are looking to it as an investment opportunity.
It’s a far cry from the state of play just two or three years ago, when climate intervention was still considered by most to be an outlandish idea.
While the idea of doing trials to test the various proposed methods for climate control is now more mainstream, it’s still contentious for two reasons: the potential side-effects, and also the fear that it will turn our attention away from the urgency of mitigation.
So for the most part, geoengineering is still an armchair activity, as Kintisch puts it, and as a result the pool of people involved in still relatively small.
Despite that fact, however, Kintisch and Goodell cover the subject from decidedly different perspectives, according to Inman.
He writes:
"Both books cover a lot of the same ideas and quote many of the same sources, and both have in-depth chapters about two particular options: fertilizing the oceans with iron, and ships spewing cloud-brightening particles.
Kintisch's book, though, offers up more examples of geoengineering…Kintisch also digs deeper than Goodell into explaining the details of how geoengineering might work — and why it would be so difficult to do well.
A reporter for the journal Science who regularly covers geoengineering for the journal's ScienceInsider blog, Kintisch likewise takes an insider's view in Hack the Planet.
That's not to say Kintisch argues in favour of geoengineering, but that he writes from firmly within the world of science, and for an audience who's comfortable with science, too.
He never explains the term 'hack' in the title, for example, which is borrowed from computer hacking and reflects the idea that geoengineering involves interfering with fundamental aspects of the climate to change how the whole system works.
For this reason, scientists and other science-literate readers — especially those who already have some familiarity with geoengineering — will probably prefer Kintisch's book over Goodell's.
Cleo Paskal must be cursing the publishing gods.
Had Paskal , author of Global Warring: How Environmental, Economic, and Political Crises Will Redraw the World Map, finished her book last fall – when 'climate security' was a buzzword in foreign policy circles - she'd have timed it perfectly, writes Keith Kloor in a review on Nature Reports Climate Change .
All anyone wants to talk about these days is purloined emails, errors in the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and the literary pursuits of its chair Rajendra Pachauri.
But, notes Kloor, Paskal’s book is about much more than security experts talking up the threat posed by rising seas.
Instead, the author - a London-based journalist and a scholar at the think tank Chatham House - presents a vision of a new world order, in which the United States and the European Union face off against China and Russia as climate change takes hold.
Canada currently claims the Northwest Passage as part of its territorial waters, and this standoff could prod Canada to explore a strategic relationship with Russia, which has its own designs on the Arctic.
Meanwhile, China is knocking at Canada's door, eager to purchase a slice of the country's abundant natural resources.
In a 'stateless' Northwest Passage, Russia and China could end up being the big players, especially if they forge stronger economic ties to Canada, writes Kloor.
Economist Nicholas Stern released his new book just a couple of weeks ago, in which he updates his assessment of the costs of tackling climate change from his 2006 review for the UK government.
In Blueprint for a Safer Planet, Stern frames this as an affordable, effective global deal that could be adopted at the UN negotiations in Copenhagen in December.
Fellow economist Frank Ackerman, who has written extensively on the costs of climate change, and who has critiqued Stern’s 2006 Review , gives his take on the new book over on Nature Reports Climate Change.
Here are are some excerpts on the science.
Ackerman writes:
Climatologist James Hansen, among others, has argued that stabilizing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations at 450 p.p.m.
would leave them at a dangerously high level and has called for a safer limit of 350 p.p.m.
Stern responds that his global deal, putting us on track to 450 p.p.m., is at the outer limits of what is politically feasible in the near term; achieving Stern’s goals for 2050 would position us to revise global targets downward in the future, if needed.
His conclusion highlights the striking congruence between parts of the Stern proposals and parts of UK climate policy:
A short while ago, stand-up economist Yoram Bauman reviewed Frank Ackerman’s ‘Can We Afford the Future?
: the Economics of a Warming World’, a layman’s guide to one of the most pressing and complex questions of out time, over on Nature Reports Climate Change.
To the Editor - Yoram Bauman has written a hostile and dismissive review of my book, Can We Afford the Future?
: The Economics of a Warming World (Zed Books, 2009).
With my book, he says, "the bumper-sticker culture of cable TV news has finally reached ... the economics of climate change.
" I allegedly failed to recognize the virtues of mainstream economics and oversimplified the subject "for the masses".
Oddly enough, Bauman is best known for performing as a stand-up comedian making fun of mainstream economics.
His signature performance offers a flippant 'translation' of ten principles of economics from a leading textbook.
How could a stand-up comic dislike bumper stickers and communication with "the masses"?
I plead guilty to summarizing a complicated subject in four provocative, non-technical statements suitable for printing on bumper stickers.
This was an intentional strategy to combat the 'eyes glazing over' effect that technical economics has on most people, and to lead the reader into substantive discussion of the big issues about the costs and benefits of climate change mitigation.
More than two years have passed since Nick Stern’s report on the economics of climate change was published, yet the question of how to weigh the costs against the benefits of acting on climate change – and whether such an approach in even ethical – is still being hotly debated.
Stern's adherents, on the one hand, support the stance of the former World Bank economist who argues that taking strong, early action on climate change outweighs the costs of doing nothing, or of delaying action.
On the other hand, some of Stern’s detractors – most notably ‘skeptical environmentalist’ Bjorn Lomborg - argue that although climate change is happening, major reductions in carbon emissions are simply not worth the money .
(Others argues that Stern was right for the wrong reasons , but I won't go into that here).
The latest to weigh on the issue is Frank Ackerman , a research economist at Tufts University in Massachusetts, whose new book Can We Afford the Future?
: the Economics of a Warming World is reviewed by Yoram Bauman over on Nature Reports Climate Change.
Bauman teaches at the University of Washington, but he is perhaps better known for adding levity to such impenetrable topics as climate economics with his stand-up comedy routines .
Bauman picks out some highlights of Ackerman's analysis, namely his policy prescription for massive government-funded clean-energy R&D and his coverage of Harvard economist Martin Weitzman 's work on improbable, but not impossible, catastrophic climate change.
Smith does an excellent job of conveying how oil, formed from the compressed remains of tiny plants and animals, could cause the demise of the most sophisticated species to have ever lived.
And although we may be running out of the stuff, its pervasiveness in society means that weaning ourselves off oil will be no mean feat.
There are no clear estimates of exactly how much oil is left in the ground, but the overwhelming message in Crude is that there are easily enough fossil fuel reserves to radically alter our climate should we use them all.
For anyone interested in the state of the earth’s climate, the most recent reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change are essential - if not exactly bedtime - reading (I prefer a bit of Proust myself).
Fair enough, the panel’s synthesis report collapsed the three prior encyclopaedic volumes into a summary of what one really needs to know about climate change, its impacts and what we could/ought to do about it, but it’s still not the most accessible synopsis I’ve seen.
Now this problem has been solved with a diminutive and accessible translation in the form of Mike Mann and Lee Kump’s Dire Predictions , reviewed here for us by Jay Gulledge of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change .
Gulledge, who briefs decision-makers in various sectors on the science and projected impacts of climate change, applauds the fact that he no longer has to consider whether to lug around three books the size of the Los Angeles telephone directory, and can instead use this “lavishly illustrated volume”, which he says is “little more than a centimetre thick and fits neatly in the outer pocket of my backpack”.
Former Time magazine reporter Eric Roston chronicles the story of carbon and its significance in the wider universe in his first book ‘The Age of Carbon’, which Mark Lynas reviews over on Nature Reports Climate Change.
“People are broadly concerned, but not entirely convinced”, concludes the l atest poll on public opinion of global warming by social marketing group Ipsos Mori.
Despite the deluge of media reports in the last year documenting the scientific consensus on climate change and the startling rapidity at which impacts are being seen around the world - most notably perhaps the ever-decreasing Arctic sea ice - 60% of the British Public is uncertain that climate change is caused by humans, and many others believe that scientists are overstating the problem.
There is growing concern that an economic depression and rising fuel and food prices are denting public interest in environmental issues.
Some environmentalists blame the public's doubts on last year's Channel 4 documentary The Great Global Warming Swindle, and on recent books, including one by Lord Lawson, the former Chancellor, that question the consensus on climate change.
The Great Global Warming Swindle resulted in a record 250 complaints to regulatory watchdog Ofcom (including the first ever peer reviewed complaint), but that’s still a fraction of the 2.5 million viewers.
Like many of those who saw the Channel 4 documentary, readers of Lawson’s offering on climate change ‘An Appeal to Reason’ are probably unaware it has been scientifically discredited in almost every review, including one on Nature Reports Climate Change by Sir John Houghton , Honorary Scientist at the UK’s Hadley Centre.
Promised as a "rare breath of intellectual rigour" and a "hard headed examination of the realities" of climate change, this offering is neither cool nor rational….and is largely one of misleading messages.
Lawson’s fundamental misunderstanding of basic scientific concepts is first displayed in his interpretation of the temperature records for the first part of this century, with which he attempts to discredit the science of climate change, and the work of many thousands of researchers who’ve dedicated entire careers to the problem.
More recently, he repeats this in an amusing attack on the recent Nature paper by NASA’s Cynthia Rosenzweig.
As Houghton rightly points out, Lawson is in need of climate science 101.
But then, it seems, he's not alone - at least on that count.
What happens to the planet if air traffic keeps multiplying too fast for new climate-friendly plane upgrades to keep pace with the rising greenhouse emissions?
The IPCC mulled it over almost a decade ago, even before sounding its 2001 global warming alarm call .
Lately the problem has been pressing ever harder on European consciences, so that EU parliament members recently vowed to fast-track plans for trading aviation emissions on a carbon market - while airlines yelped defensively that they'd gotten an unfair tarring in mediagenic protests .
London's Science Museum examines this race of energy efficiency against passenger numbers in a new exhibit, Does Flying Cost the Earth?, which I took a look at in Nature Reports Climate Change this week.
Much of the show is reproduced online , including the museum's smart matrix of pros and cons for various technologies proposed to clean up jet fumes.
(There are more details in a recent roundup of aviation innovation from Nature News ; subscription required.
) For a quick gut-level hit of the central dilemma, the museum has included a very simple video game where you're in charge of containing the damage from a booming aviation industry.
Indeed, Reay compares it Rachel Carson’s celebrated Silent Spring in its ability to engage millions and commends its even-handed coverage of the ‘climate debate’.
Reay writes:
Over on The Intersection Chris Mooney refers to it as "the best global warming book I've ever read", and has a similar stance to Reay.
Of Walker and King, he writes:
Their overview of the science and policy of climate change is a model of clarity, comprehensiveness and, above all, sanity.
It truly does find a middle ground in the climate debate.
On the contrary, Prins (who authored a Commentary in Nature last year with Steve Rayner calling for a radical alternative to the Kyoto Protocol) argues that the book is both “troubling” and “relentlessly normative” in that it represents “an unquestioning acceptance of the received wisdom”.
Prins is especially disgruntled with how Walker and King, in his view, polarize perspectives on the way forward on climate policy:
[They] have no scintilla of doubt that the Kyoto Protocol is the road to follow and that anyone who deserts it is wrong and possibly corrupt.
So we have as heroes the EU, which doesn't "duck" the problem, and as villains the US, languishing under the rule of "President Bush and his fiercely partisan advisers".
They lump all "sceptics" — anyone who disagrees with them — together like the damned in a Hieronymus Bosch painting of heaven and hell.
As suggested by the title, the book documents the White House-led censorship of James Hansen, director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, who bravely spoke out about the dangers and urgency of global warming long before many of his fellow climate scientists.

If there was one thing that most observers seemed to agree on in the aftermath of the hacking at the University of East Anglia, it was, as Fred Pearce wrote in Yale Environment 360 , that the emails revealed a "bunker mentality among many of the scientists" at the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit.
Other metaphors have been suggested by Judith Curry, a climate scientist at Georgia Tech University, who has said, repeatedly, that the stolen CRU emails revealed a "tribalism" among climate scientists , and a " circling of the wagons strategy .”
More recently, controversies over minor errors in the 2007 assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have escalated the debate over the integrity of climate science.
Meanwhile a prominent segment of the climate science community say that the waves of bad press since Climategate broke in November is much ado about nothing.
For example, earlier this month, Gavin Schmidt, senior climatologist with the NASA’s Goddard Institute of Space Studies, told the New York Times :
Schmidt also asserts that the media is culpable.
In recent posts on the Real Climate blog, which Schmidt co-founded, he has taken aim at specific media outlets and journalists .
Last month, he decried the "media frenzy" over the IPCC press stories:
Recently, there was another unauthorized disclosure of email correspondence between scientists that seems to bolster Curry's argument.
This exchange, from a listserv maintained by the National Academy of Sciences, captured scientists discussing ways to more effectively counter the attacks on their credibility from climate skeptics and conservative politicians, which Stanford climatologist Stephen Schneider, in the email dialogue, likened to a "smear campaign" of "neo-McCarthyism.
"
Cleo Paskal must be cursing the publishing gods.
Had Paskal , author of Global Warring: How Environmental, Economic, and Political Crises Will Redraw the World Map, finished her book last fall – when 'climate security' was a buzzword in foreign policy circles - she'd have timed it perfectly, writes Keith Kloor in a review on Nature Reports Climate Change .
All anyone wants to talk about these days is purloined emails, errors in the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and the literary pursuits of its chair Rajendra Pachauri.
But, notes Kloor, Paskal’s book is about much more than security experts talking up the threat posed by rising seas.
Instead, the author - a London-based journalist and a scholar at the think tank Chatham House - presents a vision of a new world order, in which the United States and the European Union face off against China and Russia as climate change takes hold.
Canada currently claims the Northwest Passage as part of its territorial waters, and this standoff could prod Canada to explore a strategic relationship with Russia, which has its own designs on the Arctic.
Meanwhile, China is knocking at Canada's door, eager to purchase a slice of the country's abundant natural resources.
In a 'stateless' Northwest Passage, Russia and China could end up being the big players, especially if they forge stronger economic ties to Canada, writes Kloor.
On the eve of a historic climate change summit, there are swirling political and scientific currents.
India joins the U.S. and China in pledging to reduce its carbon emissions .
“What's most interesting here is that you're starting to see, essentially, a race to the top.
After Obama announced two weeks ago that the United States would commit to a reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions at Copenhagen, China quickly followed with its own pledge.
That, in turn, led to Indian officials telling journalists that their country doesn't want to be viewed as the laggard in climate talks.
(India's been gaining a reputation, fairly or no, as a major obstacle.
) Peer pressure seems to work.”
Is Al Gore starting to have his own doubts too?
The former U.S. Vice President tells The Times that Copenhagen targets are insufficient to stave off climate catastrophe .
“Even a final treaty will have to set the stage for other tougher reductions at a later date.
We have already overshot the safe levels of CO2 in the atmosphere.
Are we doing enough?
The answer is obviously no — 450 [parts per million] is not the right target.
But it is presently seen as beyond the capacity of governments around the world.
We are stretching the capacity of governments even to hit a 450 target.”
Meanwhile, fallout continues from the stolen emails at East Anglia University’s climate unit.
As the AP reports, the university said it will conduct its own internal review ,
Additionally, Rajendra Pachauri, chairman of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC), says that claims of scientific impropriety warrant a UN investigation: As reported in The Telegraph, he told BBC Radio :
In the meantime, the highly respected American Meteorological Society (AMA) has released a statement on the affair, saying that nothing in the emails suggest that the scientific consensus on climate has been weakened:
“For climate change research, the body of research in the literature is very large and the dependence on any one set of research results to the comprehensive understanding of the climate system is very, very small.
Even if some of the charges of improper behavior in this particular case turn out to be true — which is not yet clearly the case — the impact on the science of climate change would be very limited.”
It seems like yesterday when everyone was downplaying expectations for success at next week’s climate summit in Copenhagen.
Not anymore.
Nicholas Stern writes in the Guardian :
“How do you draw something up that doesn’t require treaty approval by the U.S. Senate (no one thinks there are 67 votes for a real climate policy)?
How do you give credit for actions already taken?
How do you keep carbon trading from turning into one more Wall Street boondoggle?”
James Hansen, for his part, continues to insist that cap and trade is an “inefficient compromise” and that governments going to Copenhagen are “lying through their teeth” if they say otherwise.
In Grist, Hansen writes that climate negotiators need to solve one main equation:
"Any credible plan for avoiding dangerous climate change will have to address the question of what India, China, Russia and the U.S. are going to do with the coal they have underground that we cannot afford for them to release into the atmosphere.
If they are not going to use that coal, ever, then who is going to compensate them for the benefits lost?
And if they are going to use it, then who is going to pay for its carbon content to be sequestered?”
A week ago, prospects for an international climate agreement were fading fast.
Now, with only days to go before the Copenhagen summit gets underway, recent developments in China and the U.S. have renewed hopes for a “breakthrough” deal.
“the first time in more than a decade that an American administration has offered even a tentative promise to reduce production of climate-altering gases.”
Not to be outdone, China has just announced that it’s premier,Wen Jiabao, will also attend the climate summit, and the country plans to reduce its own “carbon intensity” over the coming decades.
As Juliet Eilperrin writes in the Washington Post :
“The move by the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter to announce a near-term target of a 40 to 45 percent reduction, coming a day after President Obama set U.S. climate goals for the talks, suggests a possible breakthrough in Denmark next month in the long-stalled climate negotiations.”
But it’s not just the recent U.S. and China actions that are propelling momentum.
Connie Hedegaard, Danish minister for the climate conference tells the Washington Post :
"One by one, governments from all over the world are delivering before the climate conference next month.
Last week, we saw concrete targets from Brazil and South Korea, and Russia improved its bid.
All across the globe, things are moving.
"
Still, Alan Wang of the Natural Resources Defence Council tells the Times of London that these opening targets put forward from Beijing and Washington have symbolic heft:
“What has been noticeably absent so far in the ClimateGate discussion is a public reaffirmation by climate researchers of our basic research values: the rigors of the scientific method (including reproducibility), research integrity and ethics, open minds, and critical thinking.
Under no circumstances should we ever sacrifice any of these values; the CRU emails, however, appear to violate them.”
Arguably the world’s most famous climate scientist, and Director of NASA’s Goddard Institute of Space Studies in New York, Hansen’s conviction that a climate catastrophe is looming has led him, in recent years, to increasingly take on the role of advocate, sending numerous pleading letters to world leaders and CEOs, and attending well-publicized protests against coal plants.
It’s also prompted him, at the age of 68, to write his first book, which looks at the dangerous climatic events that will greet the next generation if the fossil fuel use continues unabated.
Due out in December, Storms of My Grandchildren is the silver lining of Hansen’s recent fight with prostate cancer, which afforded him a six-week recuperative period during which he finished his book.
In an interview with Keith Kloor, Hansen discusses the climate problem and potential solutions, his personal carbon footprint and his frustration with political ‘greenwashing’.
"I am sorry to say", he writes in his book, "that most of what politicians are doing on the climate front is greenwashing — their proposals sound good, but they are deceiving you and themselves at the same time.
"
Hansen tells Kloor that former US Vice President Al Gore is among those deceiving themselves that we are on track to solving the climate problem.
"I saw him on Larry King last night," says Hansen, "and what really worries me is that he sounds optimistic that we're now on a track to solve this problem.
" He lets out an incredulous chuckle.
"We're not, however, on a track, and that's clear.
"
Less than three weeks before more than 60 world leaders will gather in Copenhagen for a historic climate change summit, the Obama Administration is saying don’t count them out.
According to the Guardian , White House officials have told reporters that President Obama will soon announce a U.S. proposed target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
Until now, it’s been assumed that the U.S. couldn’t offer an emissions reduction target until its Congress passed a climate change bill, the details of which are still being worked out in various Senate committees.
But as one senior White House official tells Politico :
An increasing sense of urgency for international action comes today with the publication of The Copenhagen Diagnosis .
The report, compiled by 26 climate researchers, is an update of the latest climate science since 2007.
A number of the participating scientists have issued statements accompanying the report , among them Matthew England, joint Director of the Climate Change Research Centre of the University of NSW, Australia:
"We have already almost exceeded the safe level of emissions that would ensure a reasonably secure climate future.
Within just a decade global emissions need to be declining rapidly.
A binding treaty is needed urgently to ensure unilateral action among the high emitters.
"
While many are feeling pessimistic about the prospects for a deal at Copenhagen, Geoffrey Lean at Grist believes the big climate summit still has a pulse .
He reports that “environment ministers from 40 key countries—assembled this week for a two-day preparatory meeting in Copenhagen—made good progress towards a political agreement.”
“It is all very difficult.
But there is a chance that, with luck and skill, a climate-saving deal can be reached.
And while far from ideal, the hope that a deal is still salvageable is a lot better than the doom that was so widely pronounced at the start of the week.”
Meanwhile, are people suffering from “climate fatigue,” and tuning out the steady drumbeat of alarming news on climate change?
Richard Kerr in Science examines the communication challenges [subscription required].
He writes:
“Almost all climate scientists are of one mind about the threat of global warming: It's real, it's dangerous, and the world needs to take action immediately.
But they disagree about the best way to convey the urgency of the situation to the public and policymakers.”
At Yale Environment 360 , Ted Nordhaus and Michael Shellenberger argue that one thing not to do is hype the danger incessantly.
Pointing to the consistent polling that shows Americans to have soft support for climate change measures, the authors assert:
The U.S. Congressional climate bill will be tabled until next year, reports The Wall Street Journal .
Says Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus:
"It's common understanding that climate-change legislation will not be brought up on the Senate floor and pass the Senate this year.
"
Just how important is the U.S. climate bill to a climate change agreement in Copenhagen?
It’s everything, argues Geoffrey Lean in Grist :
“Never before has such a vital, international treaty depended so crucially on the 535 members of the U.S. Congress. Even previous environmental breakthroughs, such as the Montreal Protocol on the ozone layer or the Washington Convention on Endangered Species, were preceded by U.S. legislation. As such, the rest of the world is experiencing for the first time how its vital interests can be affected by American politics, as senators from coal or oil states object to legislation that would curb emissions from fossil fuels.”
In lieu of this, “the Obama Administration is considering endorsing a limited short-term climate pact,” reports Juliet Eilperin in the Washington Post .
She writes:
Passing climate legislation through the US Senate may be tricky, but that hasn’t scared off the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency from doing its part.
As Stephen Power at the WSJ’s Environmental Capitol notes:
“Congress might be a long way from passing legislation to fight climate change, but the Obama administration appears one step closer to creating its own regime for controlling greenhouse gases.”
But if an accord isn’t reached this year, the global climate-change negotiations may be “headed toward the same aimless end” as the notoriously endless ‘Doha round’ of global trade talks, writes Bryan Walsh at Time magazine .
“Addressing climate change demands a paradigm shift on a scale akin to that required to end the Cold War.”
"The threat of climate change means we need to make a transition from a system that relies heavily on high-carbon fossil fuels, to a radically different system that includes nuclear, renewable and clean coal power.”
Ready for another puzzler?
What’s going on with that Indian government report claiming there is no evidence that global warming has shrunk Himmalayan glaciers?
Rajendra Pachauri, the chairman of the IPCC, is hopping mad over this, and gives The Guardian an earful, and then some .
Finally, in the feel-good story of the day, Politico reports that two U.S. political combatants know how to set aside their differences at the end of the day and share warm and fuzzy gifts.
"We are really very good friends,” Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer tells Politico, referring to Republican Senator Jim Inhofe, who has called global warming 'the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people.
' Adds Boxer: “It’s a good working relationship we have.
People are very surprised about it.”
Amidst this backdrop, cap-and-trade, which is the basis for the congressional climate legislation, is getting raked over the coals again.
Two attorneys for the U.S Environmental Protection Agency penned an op-ed for the Washington Post, in which they asserted :
“The House and Senate climate bills are not a first step in the right direction.
They would give away valuable rights in cap-and-trade permits and create a trillion-dollar carbon-offsets market that will not lead to needed reductions.
Together, the illusion of greenhouse-gas reductions and the creation of powerful lobbies seeking to protect newly created profits in permits and offsets would lock in climate degradation for a decade or more.”
“We’ll need to spend trillions of dollars over time to save the planet from climate change.
All the more reason not to let lobbyists make a financial game out of this deadly serious effort.”
Did American politicians thus bet on the wrong horse, muses Keith Johnson at the WSJ’s Environmental Capitol ?
He suggests it might be wise to set aside the conventional wisdom about carbon taxes being “a political dead-end.” Johnson lays out how environmentalists can find common ground with deficit hawks on a climate bill centered on a carbon tax.
“The snows of Mount Kilimanjaro will be gone within two decades, according to scientists who say that the rapid melting of its glacier cap over the past century provides dramatic physical evidence of global climate change.”
So if Copenhagen doesn’t produce a global warming treaty next month, which now seems likely , what about setting up a global environmental body?
The environmental ministers for Italy and Kenya float this idea in a Guardian op-ed .
They note that Chancellor Merkel of Germany and President Sarkozy of France are lobbying to have the idea taken up at Copenhagen:
“In a letter to the UN secretary general [Merkel and Sarkozy] emphasised that we must overhaul environmental governance and use Copenhagen climate talks in December to progress the creation of a world environmental organisation.”
“is somewhat of an anomaly for Canada, whose government has been accused of sabotaging the global climate change talks by its development of the Alberta tar sands and its refusal to make deep cuts in its greenhouse gas emissions.”
Three days of hearings on climate legislation in the U.S. Senate’s Environment and Public Works committee concluded on Thursday.
The big story to emerge, according to Politico , is a key moderate Democrat’s “serious reservations” about the bill.
Recalcitrant Republicans, meanwhile, heard about the national security implications of climate change from retired military brass and former Republican Sen. John Warner, who is a close ally of the military.
He cautioned:
"We are talking about energy insecurity, water and food shortages, and climate-driven social instability.
We ignore these threats at the peril of our national security and at great risk to those in uniform.
"
The African Union takes up the issue of "climate refugees" in a new treaty that addresses the plight of displaced people.
According to IRIN , a U.N. news service:
“the inclusion of displacement by natural disasters was informed by the global debate on the need to develop a framework for the rights of ‘climate refugees’ - people uprooted from their homes and crossing international borders - because the changing climate threatened their survival.”
The public battle starts anew on the U.S. congressional climate & energy bill, as senate hearings get underway today.
Keith Johnson over at the WSJ’s Environmental Capital believes that three camps will shape the debate:
“Those that believe climate legislation will actually strengthen the economy, those that figure it will have significant but manageable costs, and those that figure it will further burden a recession-challenged economy.
Much of the opposition in the Senate—both from Republicans and Democrats—centers on how big the final bill is and who picks up the tab.”
Despite the tough congressional slog, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that he was hopeful the U.S. congress would pass the bill before the upcoming Copenhagen climate change conference in December.
At a press conference on Monday , the Secretary General said he would be personally calling Senators to pick up the pace.
“a source close to the Administration said it was ‘hard to see the benefit’ of his going to Copenhagen if there was no comprehensive deal for him to close or sign.
Another expert, who did not want to be named, said he would be ‘really, really shocked’ if Mr Obama went to Copenhagen, adding that European hopes about the power of his Administration to transform the climate change debate in a matter of months bore little relation to reality.”
Despite the increasingly bleak outlook for a comprehensive deal at Copenhagen, people around the world on Saturday expressed their concern about global warming.
At over 5,000 events, signs and banners were unfurled that read 350, a symbolic number in reference to 350 parts per million, which many scientists have said should be the limit for carbon dioxide concentrations in the earth’s atmosphere.
(We’re currently topping out at 387 parts per million.
)
That’s a pretty big if, especially in the case of the United States, since the U.S. official position is that it won’t commit to any targets until its Congress passes a climate change bill that is now in the senate.
“Without such a commitment,” the New York Times writes , “other nations are loath to make their own pledges.”
Except the EU, that is.
There’s still plenty of deal-making happening on the sidelines, though.
For example, the border between China and India may be heating up over competing land claims , but that hasn’t stopped the two countries from inking a deal to cooperate on energy and climate issues ahead of Copenhagen.
"The battle over the Senate climate bill starts in earnest today, with more details on the Kerry-Boxer bill, fresh economic analysis from the EPA, and a speech by President Obama backing the measure.
"
“There has been a sharp decline over the past year in the percentage of Americans who say there is solid evidence that global temperatures are rising.
And fewer also see global warming as a very serious problem – 35% say that today, down from 44% in April 2008.” Andrew Kohut, the director of the Pew Research center, tells AP that the poll's results probably reflect the bleak economic landscape :
“The priority that people give to pollution and environmental concerns and a whole host of other issues is down because of the economy and because of the focus on other things.”
"There were two small (and puzzling) bits of consolation in the poll: many respondents support limiting greenhouse-gas emissions, and many want the U.S. to join an international climate-change plan.
"
"One reason to stop focusing on what people think about the science of climate change is that a majority of the public supports action on emissions as well as international cooperation on climate change.
The policy challenge is thus to design policies that can be effective given the strong political support that has existed on this topic for some time.
The realities are that support is about as strong as it is likely to be, and really hasn't changed much over a decade or longer.
"
Ironically, the Poll came out a day after 18 scientific organizations sent a letter to the U.S. Congress , reaffirming “the multiple independent lines of evidence” for climate change:
“Observations throughout the world make it clear that climate change is occurring, and rigorous scientific research demonstrates that the greenhouse gases emitted by human activities are the primary driver.”
“given the impression that we are global-warming deniers of the worst sort, and that our analysis of the issue is ideological and unscientific.
Most gravely, we stand accused of misrepresenting the views of one of the most respected climate scientists on the scene, whom we interviewed extensively.
If everything they said was actually true, it would indeed be a damning indictment.
But it’s not.”
Roger Pielke Jr., never one to shy away from a battle, believes that Dubner and his co-author Steven Levitt have indeed been critized by Joe Romm over at Climate Progress.
Dubner's charges have been denied by Romm, who has written multiple, lengthy posts in just the last 24 hours to defend himself .
Regardless of who claims the high ground in this episode, Bradford Plumer reminds us over at The New Republic's website that Dubner has yet to "address any of the errors that scientists like William Connolley have pointed out," which Olive Heffernan summarized here :
In recent weeks, the big news on the U.S. business front has been about all the companies, such as Apple, quitting their membership in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce because of the latter’s hostility to regulatory action on global warming.
Now it seems that the climate issue is dividing energy producers as well.

I’m due to travel to Japan this Friday for a conference on Climate Change Effects on Fish and Fisheries.
If I get there, I’ll be providing regular updates from the conference here on Climate Feedback.
But that’s beginning to look like a big ‘if’.
The volcanic ash cloud from Eyjafjallajökull is still keeping planes grounded across the UK and could do for several days to come .
That’s bad news for a lot of people, but could it be good news for the climate?
There’s also the question of how the absence of contrails – or condensation clouds – from commercial airplanes will affect the climate in the short term.
Remember that post 9/11 contrail study , which supposedly showed that the average daily temperature over the continental US suddenly widened in the 3 days after the September 11 terrorist attacks, when all commercial air traffic was banned from American skies?
Its main conclusion – that daily highs and lows in temperature were more extreme in the absence of contrails - has since been refuted , but the flight ban over Europe should provide another opportunity to test the hypothesis.
And then, of course, there’s the ash from Eyjafjallajökull itself.
The eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991 cooled global temperatures by about half a degree over the following months, which has led some to propose pumping sulphate aerosols into the atmosphere as a means of artificially cooling the climate.
Katharine Sanderson writes on The Great Beyond :
So will the ash from have a lasting effect on our climate?
Probably not according to Alan Robock, a meteorologist from Rutgers University, New Brunswick, US.
“So far, the emissions have been so small, that I expect no climate impacts,” he says.
On April 14, there was 0.004 megatons of sulphur dioxide, as compared to 20 megatons for Mount Pinatubo in 1991, and it was emitted into the troposphere, where its lifetime is only a week or so, as opposed to 1-2 years for the stratosphere for Pinatubo.
The ash will also fall out quickly, so I expect no climate impact, unless the eruption gets much stronger.
When I started working last month on a news feature about gaps in climate science I was expecting a tough reporting job.
Too fresh, so I thought, were the scars the field and many leading scientists had received from the hacking affair at the Climate Research Unit (CRU) in Norwich to readily discuss with a reporter the ‘dirty laundry’ (my phrase) of climate science.
My concerns proved unfounded.
Some of the scientists I interviewed for the piece did complain about the “insane” climate of suspicion they are working in, and not only since the CRU incident rocked the field.
But none of them had the slightest reservation about openly speaking with me at length about gaps and uncertainties in their respective fields of inquiry.
As one would expect, there are indeed many gaps to be filled in this still rather young discipline of research.
My feature describes unressolved problems in four specific areas - regional climate prediction, precipitation changes, aerosols, and tree ring-based temperature reconstructions.
None of the considerable uncertainties related with these things have been kept secret by any means; but all four have led, and continue to do so, to enduring misconceptions and false claims which deserve better clarification and greater open discussion in the public and policy spheres.
I have also taken a closer look at some of the favourite ‘myths’ that keep circulating among the climate sceptics community and beyond, such as that global warming stopped ten years ago.
An accompanying editorial , drawing upon sociological insight, argues that the climate-research community should use a diverse set of voices, from different backgrounds, when communicating with policy-makers and the public, and that scientists should be careful not to disparage those on the other side of the debate.
International climate policy is largely focused on reducing emissions of carbon dioxide.
But even if we reduce emissions now, a proportion of CO2 will stay in the atmosphere for millennia.
A faster-acting strategy is needed if we’re to avoid dangerous climate change in the short term.
That’s the message from a team of experts writing in the latest issue of PNAS.
What’s needed to mitigate climate change fast, Nobel laureate Mario Molina and colleagues argue, is a focus on phasing out short-term warming agents.
They pinpoint four non-CO2 gases and particles that could be regulated under existing legislation.
Complementing cuts in CO2, these faster-acting mitigation strategies could “begin within 2–3 years, be substantially implemented in 5–10 years and produce a climate response within decades”, write the authors.
Their message on the need to regulate short-lived warming agents such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and black carbon is not new.
To some extent Molina and co-authors reiterate the call for early action that appeared in a Nature editorial back in July .
They, too, recommend that the Montreal Protocol be amended to include the phase-out of atmospheric HFCs, currently regulated under the Kyoto Protocol.
But they go further in their recommendations for dealing with black carbon, suggesting possible technologies to reduce its production from cooking stoves and diesel emissions, as well as feasible institutional and political arrangements to put these technologies in place.
In addition, they call for efforts to reduce pollutant gases such as methane and nitrous oxides that ultimately increase ozone - a significant greenhouse gas - in the lower atmosphere.
Regulating emissions from agriculture and transport would be crucial here.
Last on their wish list is more and better biosequestration - through means such as biochar - to give carbon sinks a much-needed boost.

Carbon dioxide emissions and their associated warming could linger for millennia, according to some climate scientists.
Mason Inman looks at why the fallout from burning fossil fuels could last far longer than expected.
hangover last?
And what about the global fever that comes along with it?
These sound like simple questions, but the answers are complex — and not well understood or appreciated outside a small group of climate scientists.
Popular books on climate change — even those written by scientists — if they mention the lifetime of CO
"That's complete nonsense," says Ken Caldeira of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Stanford, California.
It doesn't help that the summaries in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports have confused the issue, allege Caldeira and colleagues in an upcoming paper in Annual Reviews of Earth and Planetary Sciences 2 .
Now he and a few other climate scientists are trying to spread the word that human-generated CO
from fossil fuels will last in the atmosphere.
As he puts it in his new book The Long Thaw, "The lifetime of fossil fuel CO
in the atmosphere is a few centuries, plus 25 percent that lasts essentially forever.
The next time you fill your tank, reflect upon this" 3 .
"The climatic impacts of releasing fossil fuel CO
to the atmosphere will last longer than Stonehenge," Archer writes.
"Longer than time capsules, longer than nuclear waste, far longer than the age of human civilization so far.
"
The effects of carbon dioxide on the atmosphere drop off so slowly that unless we kick our "fossil fuel addiction", to use George W. Bush's phrase, we could force Earth out of its regular pattern of freezes and thaws that has lasted for more than a million years.
"If the entire coal reserves were used," Archer writes, "then glaciation could be delayed for half a million years.
"
in the atmosphere is probably the least well understood part of the global warming issue," says paleoclimatologist Peter Fawcett of the University of New Mexico.
"And it's not because it isn't well documented in the IPCC report.
It is, but it is buried under a lot of other material.
"
It doesn't help, though, that past reports from the UN panel of climate experts have made misleading statements about the lifetime of CO
molecule does spend about 5 years in the atmosphere.
But the oceans also release much of that CO
"The climatic impacts of releasing fossil fuel CO
to the atmosphere will last longer than Stonehenge, longer than time capsules, longer than nuclear waste, far longer than the age of human civilization so far.
"
because of the different rates of uptake by different removal processes.
" The IPCC's latest assessment, however, avoids the problems of earlier reports by including similar caveats while simply refusing to give a numeric estimate of the lifetime for carbon dioxide.
Contributing author Richard Betts of the UK Met Office Hadley Centre says the panel made this change in recognition of the fact that "the lifetime estimates cited in previous reports had been potentially misleading, or at least open to misinterpretation.
"
Instead of pinning an absolute value on the atmospheric lifetime of CO
increase will be removed from the atmosphere within 30 years, and a further 30% will be removed within a few centuries.
The remaining 20% may stay in the atmosphere for many thousands of years.
" But if cumulative emissions are high, the portion remaining in the atmosphere could be higher than this, models suggest.
Overall, Caldeira argues, "the whole issue of our long-term commitment to climate change has not really ever been adequately addressed by the IPCC.
"
lifetime, we cannot solve the climate problem by slowing down emissions by 20% or 50% or even 80%.
It does not matter much whether the CO
we emit will be soaked up by the ocean over a few hundred years, first being absorbed into the surface waters, and eventually into deeper waters, according to a long-term climate model run by Archer.
Though the ocean is vast, the surface waters can absorb only so much CO
, and currents have to bring up fresh water from the deep before the ocean can swallow more.
Then, on a much longer timescale of several thousand years, most of the remaining CO
to return atmospheric levels to what they were before industrialization, shows oceanographer Toby Tyrrell of the UK's National Oceanography Centre, Southampton, in a recent paper 4 .
Finally, the slowest process of all is rock weathering, during which atmospheric CO
emissions.
"For practical purposes, 500 to 1000 years is 'forever,'" as Hansen and colleagues put it.
In this time, civilizations can rise and fall, and the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets could melt substantially, raising sea levels enough to transform the face of the planet.
But this was not some peculiarity of their model, as the same behaviour shows up in an extremely simplified model of the climate 6 — the only difference between the models being the final temperature of the planet.
Archer and Victor Brovkin of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany found much the same result from much longer-term simulations 6 .
Their model shows that whether we emit a lot or a little bit of CO
Because of changes in the Earth's orbit, ice sheets might start to grow from the poles in a few thousand years — but there's a good chance our greenhouse gas emissions already may prevent that, Archer argues.
Even with the amount of CO
emitted so far, another ice age will almost certainly start in about 50,000 years.
But if we burn all remaining fossil fuels, it could be more than half a million years before the Earth has another ice age, Archer says.
The long-term effects of our emissions might seem far removed.
But as Tyrrell says, "It is a little bit scary, if you think about all the concerns we have about radioactive wastes produced by nuclear power.
The potential impacts from emitting CO
to the atmosphere are even longer than that.
" But there's still hope for avoiding these long-term effects if technologies that are now on the drawing board can be scaled up affordably.
"If civilization was able to develop ways of scrubbing CO

(2) p 168 makes the assertion that economics models are better than climate models.
They provide no evidence at all to back this up, and I don't believe it.
P 171: discussion of externalities.
Good. Rather superficial discussion of the problem of solving emissions through taxation - but then these are anti-tax peole, so thats just their natural bias.
P 174-5: rather extended example to demonstrate that externalities can be positive.
This is all in preparation for the idea of cooling the planet via stratospheric injection of aerosol precursors, which Caldeira has been pushing.
Long, rather tedious boosting of NM.
(5) All climate models produce the same answers because people tune the models to produce the same answers.
Zero evidence for this one, and appears to be contradicted by the divergence of the range of models available.
(6) CO2 is over-emphasised because water vapour is the dominant GHG.
I did that one years ago and I'm sure its been done again elsewhere (oh yes: RC ).
This is one of the have-you-got-a-clue issues; parroting this (as the Freakos do, and as their chosen climate experts do) shows that they are utterly hopeless.
(8) CO2 doesn't necessarily warm: ice cores show that T rises *after* CO2 rises.
Sigh; again, they need to read RC .
Though I think Eric Wolff said it best.
I didn't even get as far as their solution; if you fight your way on you'll find its just geoengineering by injecting SO2 into the stratosphere; so far so dull.
See RC .
[Update: The pdf is gone , so I can't check up, but I've recalled another error from the Freako's eggheads: that stopping the THC will stop the Gulf Stream.
that is Wrong; the GS is a wind-driven western boundary current
Uupdate; UCS didn't think much of it either.
I notice that they say "The authors claim climate models have a very wide range of future temperature projections (page 168).
" which is quite funny since I quote them complaining that all the moels produce the same answers...
Well, thanks for saving me ~$20.
That's one book I can cross off my reading list.
If they are as sloppy as this on climate, how can we trust them on anthing else?
Not entirely clear to me what the Freakonomics folks think is happening to climate though, so I don't know if there's a margin for a bet.
Since they made loads of money the first time round, they thought they'd do it again.
Only, they had to come up with something even bigger in the contrarian 'your all wrong' stakes - hence the climate change stuff.
The lazy articles have already started, so obviously this kind of crap works, sadly.
Let the letter writing begin.
Its not much, but its the best we can do.
If you want to sell a book in the US, based around the idea of Freakonomics, then a simple dollar proposition is to attack AGW rather than to affirm it.
Every Fox/Murdoch/ journo can play the role of advertiser for the authors by endlessly quoting from their dog's breakfast of a chapter.
It rather reminds me of the philosophical notion of bulldust - proponents of bulldust don't care whether they are right or wrong, just that the bulldust achieves their aim.
Endless plugs on Fox media is my guess as to their aim, in the SuperFreaker case.
Krugman appears to have started a thorough exposition of L+D's fallacious climate economics, focusing here on their misrepresentation of Weitzman.
Interestingly the latter's paper was the key to persuading K. to raise the alarm.
Regarding your point #2, questioning the assertion that economic models are better than climate models: It is my understanding, as a reasonably educated nonspecialist, that projections of future climate change are dependent upon projections of future economic activity.
Therefore, if the economic model is bad, then the climate model is going to have problems.
On the other hand, it also is true that future economic activity is going to be influenced by climate.
Therefore, the validity of the economic model is going to depend upon the validity of the climate model.
[That would depend what you mean by "models".
Were you to mean "models, including all input data" than clearly both are interdependent if you want them both to be good.
In which case the Freako's point fails.
If you mean, how good are the models, as models, assuming 100% good input data, then I maintain my point.
Also the climate models integrate the economic forcing (CO2 emissions, mostly) and so the answer in say 2050 is tolerant of some variation of the inputs.
Incidentally, having read what the Freako's *claim* their chapter is about, the most striking point is that this matter is irrelevant - so why did they bring it up?
-W]
I've read the chapter (it was posted as a PDF on climateprogress.org) and I think it's misleading and incredibly disappointing.
Details on my blog at http://www.standupeconomist.com/blog/economics/climate-change-in-superfreakonomics/
I'd like to see the L&N authors provide an estimate of the increase in acid precipitation due to the deliberate injection of 1-2 Mt.
Pinatubos of sulfates into the atmosphere every year and an analysis of long-term effects this increase would have on marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats and productivity.
My hunch is that the "cure" would be far worse the "disease" given the very well documented effects of acid rain from unregulated coal burning in the mid 20th century.
If anything they may have helped put global warming back in the news more and driven a lot of people to your blog and others to get more informed.
Unfortunately, the anger, disrepect and lack of clarity aren't helping people get educated!
And the last problem is that there have yet to be any practical means by which to change the situation.
In fact, the cleanest source of power that doesn't rely on any lucky facts of geography is nuclear power, which the same people who now so zealously believe global warming is 100% fact demonized nuclear power as 100% dangerous and harmful.
Which, being a physicist, I know it's not nearly as bad as most people think.
I notice your very helpful chart cuts off in the 90s.
Is that because for the last 8 or 10 years warming is not in evidence and the head of the IPCC has said that despite the overwhelming forcing of CO2 something has over forced it?
i.e. CO2 absolutely drives climate except when it does not.
And of course solar activity has very little to do with climate.
It is just a coincidence that low solar activity is happening during a cooling period.
Again.
What we need to do is to get as much plant food out of the atmosphere as we can.
If we can keep it at 280 ppm +/- 10 ppm all will be well.
Unless some durn fools plant too many plants.
Then we will either have to go after them or authorize carbon burning.
[The tag-line for our paper is "There was no scientific consensus in the 1970s that the Earth was headed into an imminent ice age.
Indeed, the possibility of anthropogenic warming dominated the peer-reviewed literature even then.
", and that is correct.
The trouble is that there is no "approved version" that we are trying to counter.
"Everyone believed in global cooling in the 70's" is the common claim, and we've debunked that.
You could restrict yourself to 1975 (clearly we couldn't, becasue there is stuff past then that is of interest) but then "Up until 1975, the cumulative number of "warming" articles did not exceed the "coolers plus neutrals.
" is also rather misleading.
For *all* periods the number of warming articles is greatest.
With the salient point being that the exact same research and analytical methodologies used to detect and explain this cooling period are those being used to detect and explain the post 1970s warming.
This why the L&N "global cooling vs. global warming" strawman is a strawman.
It is not coincidental that the 1940s-1970s cooling period stopped very soon after nations began requiring stringent controls on S02 aerosol and particulate emissions from industry and power plants.
This marked reduction in industrial aerosols in the 1970s and 1980s allowed the underlying signal of increased CO2 to be no longer dampened and masked, which if nothing else confirms the veracity of the overall global warming climate models and the entire 1900-present time series.
You could also throw in the dramatic increase in tropical deforestation in the 1980s and onward as a separate forcing toward increased ambient CO2 because of the large-scale removal of the natural carbon sinks that were absorbing a lot of the CO2 produced by industrial/fossil fuel emissions during the 1940s-1970s period.
You are unaware that in the long term, plants are carbon-neutral?
Most of the carbon removed during plant growth is released as plants decay or are eaten.
In the short term, new plant growth can be a carbon sink, but once the system matures, (such as in a mature forest,) it no longer removes substantially more carbon from the atmosphere than it puts in.
It's not as if we have problems releasing carbon through burning, either.
Wildfires do it all the time.
Should we perceive some fanciful need to add more carbon to the atmosphere, I somehow don't see us having great difficulty doing that.
It's not about whether global warming is true or not (it is), it's about whether the blogging community have got it wrong this time.
The idea that the rest of us are somehow supposed to overlook how miserably the SuperFreaks botched the facts (and even direct quotes from scientists!
) on global warming AND to overlook the way they "framed" their arguments ("global cooling", etc) is just ridiculous.
Al Gore is the Bernie Madoff of climate change.
You should probably remove item #5 at this point.
While I don't think the recent CRU leak is exactly a smoking gun, it provides the evidence you say doesn't exist in your 5th point.
Threatened with encroaching seas, dwindling water supplies and fiercer storms, Bangladesh is already suffering the ill effects of rising global greenhouse gas emissions.
Mason Inman reports on how the region is coping with climate change.
Halima Katun stands on top of a breached embankment in Bhola, Bangladesh, where her land was lost to erosion.
Ali Akbar Adi takes a break from steering his ox-driven plow across his small plot of land, digging furrows for a crop of lentils and beans.
"When salt water comes in, the yields are very low," he says.
As temperatures rise, creeping seas levels are just one of the threats that could wreak havoc on the region — often referred to as ground zero for climate change — and unravel its recent economic and social progress.
Nonetheless, nature is harsh on Bangladesh.
"We are nature's laboratory on disasters," says Ainun Nishat of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in Dhaka, Bangladesh.
"We don't have volcanoes.
But any other natural disaster you think of, we have it.
" The rivers swell with summer monsoons, filling Bangladesh's vast flood-plain and submerging a quarter to a third of the land in a typical year — and up to two-thirds in the worst of years.
Several cyclones usually tear through the heart of the country each year, drowning people in storm surges and ripping up trees and homes.
Less sudden calamities — droughts in the country's few highland areas, erosion of the river banks and coastlines — also rob people of food and land.
Climate change will almost certainly make these disasters worse, threatening to reverse the country's progress.
Hurricanes in this region have gotten stronger in recent decades 1 , and continued warming in the Indian Ocean could see the trend continue, some researchers predict 2 .
Monsoon rainfall is likely to increase and to fall in more intense bursts 3 , making the annual floods broader, deeper and longer, and this could increase river erosion, too.
Farmers are already reporting changes in the growing seasons.
More erratic weather is making it hard for them to grow crops on the schedules that worked in the past.
And then there's the danger of the encroaching sea, which threatens to submerge a substantial part of the country, to worsen monsoon floods and to help storm surges clear protective embankments.
"All of that combines to [make] a recipe for pretty horrific disaster," says Atiq Rahman, executive director of the Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies (BCAS) in Dhaka and a lead author on the latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
Of all of the effects of climate change, sea level rise may pose the most pervasive challenge for Bangladesh.
Nearly the entire country is a vast, flat delta, where even a modest climb in the height of the Bay of Bengal could push water deep inland if it weren't for the protective barriers along the coast.
After being fairly stable for a couple of thousand years, sea levels have crept up about 20 centimetres since the mid-1800s.
For the coming century, the 2007 IPCC report talks about sea level rise in centimetres — to be precise, 18 to 59 centimetres.
But most climate scientists agree these estimates are too conservative, as they overlook the ways glaciers and ice sheets can slip, crack and calve off icebergs to dump increasing amounts of ice into the oceans.
Now that researchers are watching this happen and beginning to understand these processes, known as glacial dynamics, some are predicting much larger increases in sea levels.
We are nature's laboratory on disasters.
We don't have volcanoes.
But any other natural disaster you think of, we have it.
To get a rough upper limit on how far sea levels could rise, glaciologist Tad Pfeffer of the University of Colorado at Boulder and colleagues recently calculated the effects of all the world's glaciers and ice sheets flowing at very high but plausible speeds.
By 2100, they figured, sea levels are likely to rise by 0.8 metres, and possibly as much as 2 metres 4 .
What is certain is that even if people stopped emitting greenhouse gases in the next few decades, Bangladesh would still be committed to coping with sea level rise for centuries 3 .
But continuing 'business as usual' could make the situation much worse as major ice sheets disintegrate.
Considering elevation alone, even a one-metre rise would swallow about 15 to 20 per cent of Bangladesh's land area, where about 20 million people live today 6 .
But such estimates can be misleading, since they leave out some crucial factors.
For one thing, Bangladesh's delta is now expanding, as sediments settle along the coast and create new land ( Fig.
1 ).
Erosion and accretion along the Bangladeshi coastline from 1973 to 2005.

"It's adding nearly 20 square kilometres a year in the coastal areas," says Maminul Haque Sarker, a morphologist at the Center for Environmental and Geographic Information Services (CEGIS) in Dhaka.
His recent analysis 7 of satellite images shows that Bangladesh has been gaining land for decades, and old maps from the early colonial era suggest the country has been growing this way for centuries, says Sarker.
"There's a lot of accretion, and a lot of erosion, and they're almost in balance," he says.
"We are gaining land — but it is a net loss.
" That's because the new land isn't of much use right away.
For these coastal areas to support many people, they need embankments to protect them from tides and storm surges, and then they take decades to become productive, says Sarker.
Many estimates of the land area that would be lost to sea level rise are also misleading because they don't factor in the embankments that protect much of the coast, argues Nishat of IUCN.
These embankments were built starting in the 1960s to keep high tides at bay, and they also blunt the force of storm surges.
They will hold back modest sea level rise, as long as they hold up — which is a major caveat.
In many places, such as near Ali Akbar Adi's fields in Bhola, the embankments have crumbled under the onslaught of floods and storm surges.
Some parts of the coast, though, can't be protected by dikes — such as the Sundarbans.
This thick, deep green, tangled forest — which stretches across the border into India, forming the world's largest single tract of mangroves — isn't as photogenic or well known as tropical rain forests, but it is one of the world's great hotspots of biodiversity.
Submerged regularly by the tides, the Sundarbans are key breeding grounds for fish and shrimp, and a refuge for the last few hundred remaining wild Bengal tigers.
These mangroves survive only in a slightly salty zone, where there's a delicate balance between encroachment of the saline tides and fresh water flowing down through the forest's rivers.
The forest's most common species, the looking-glass tree (Heritiera littoralis), is highly sensitive to increasing salt levels.
"With a 1 metre rise in sea level, the Sundarbans are likely to disappear, which may spell the demise of the tiger and other wildlife," said the IPCC in its 2001 assessment report 3 .
"Of the increase in salinity — maybe 15, 20, 30 percent is caused by climate change," says Mahbubur Rahman, head of the Water Resources Planning Division at the Institute of Water Modelling.
"It's very hard to tell.
" But the changes so far give an inkling of what's to come.
The dry season will get drier, reducing flows even more, according to Ahsan Uddin Ahmed, Executive Director of the Center for Global Change in Dhaka.
This will allow rising seas to penetrate deeper into the forest during high tide.
Even at the forest station in Karamjal, 60 kilometres upstream from the coast, deputy forest ranger Abdul Rob points out many of the mangroves are dying at their crowns and are becoming susceptible to fungal and viral infections.
It's already too salty for traditional crops, this region's residents say.
"This area was all [rice] paddy before.
Now, no paddy," says Matthew Digbijoy Nath of Choli, another village near the southwestern coast.
"The trees look nice, but the coconut trees — there are no coconuts on them.
" Saltwater intrusion also threatens the fish farms that dot the land here, he adds.
"If it gets more salty here, this population will not be able to live here.
No paddy, no fish.
How will people live?
"
But if Nath and his family leave the area, should they be considered 'climate change refugees'?
Their problems seem to be partly due to sea level rise, but so far the bigger impact is the dwindling flow from upstream.
As well as the flow being restricted from the damming of rivers in India, scientists say that high-elevation Himalayan glaciers, which provide up to half of the dry-season flow for the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers, are now thinning and threatening the supply of fresh water to the region 8 .
These impacts are predicted to get much worse, and there's little doubt that the future could see many climate change refugees — perhaps tens of millions — fleeing parts of Bangladesh.
Already, climate change is having enough of an impact here that it's partly responsible for pushing some people off their land, says Rahman of BCAS: "I believe there are climate change refugees already.
"
Looking glass trees, also known as Sundari trees, were toppled over by Cyclone Sidr, which tore through the region in November 2007.
A few small-scale projects run by aid agencies and other organizations have set out to help people cope with the impacts of climate change.
In the coastal areas, these include growing a salt-tolerant variety of rice and catching rain to use as salt-free drinking water.
However, such projects have reached only small numbers of people, and Chowdhury of COAST argues they will make "very little" difference in the future.
Chowdhury and others support large, concerted efforts to help people here adapt, for example by building embankments.
The main barrier to such projects is lack of money.
"With its own resources, Bangladesh will not be able to cope," Chowdhury says.
But Bangladeshis have not caused these problems, he argues, since their greenhouse gas emissions per person are about one-hundredth of the average American's 9 .
"We are demanding compensation and reparations.
"
Lutfun Naher Azad of the Socio-economic Development Programme, another local development organization in the coastal district of Noakhali, also supports such reparations — as long as they're used wisely.
"It would be bad if you gave money directly to the suffering people, because it will not help," she says.
"The money should be spent for building embankments," and other large-scale projects in building stronger homes and educating people on the effects of climate change and how they can adapt.
Some large-scale funds are already in the works to help developing countries adapt.
Setting up one such source, called the Adaptation Fund, was a key part of the latest round of UN talks on climate change, held in Poznan, Poland, in December.
It has amassed US$80 million so far and could start paying out this year, but developing countries say this is only a fraction of the billions of dollars per year that is needed.
So far, the only funds received by Bangladesh and other developing countries have financed 'national adaptation plans of action'.
Bangladesh completed theirs in 2005, and in September they issued a second-generation adaptation plan 10 laying out the tasks ahead.
The country has made big strides in coping with disasters, mainly through large projects funded by foreign aid.
In past decades, for example, cyclones tore through the region, the worst killing hundreds of thousands of people.
But when the category-5 Cyclone Sidr struck in 2007, the death toll was around 3,500, and the lives saved were credited largely to embankments, cyclone shelters and warning systems that protected many of the poor.
"What we need is to strengthen the embankments to withstand stronger storm surges, and to raise them significantly in some areas," says Rahman of the Institute of Water Modelling.
"We need to have a concerted effort on this.
They were designed without considering climate change, and need to be redesigned.
"
In Science this week, a commentary (subscription required) from John Sterman, who studies systems thinking at MIT’s Sloan School of Management, argues that the public may shy off of action against climate change because their basic mental model of the problem is wrong.
People don't intuitively understand how changing rates of carbon dioxide emissions affect the overall concentration of the gas in the atmosphere, Sterman says.
In fact, they often make mistakes when thinking about how 'inputs' and 'outputs' sum up to form a total 'stock' - "even in simple, familiar contexts such as bank accounts and bathtubs".
Time’s Bryan Walsh covers the piece today , tutting over the “tremendous gap” between knowledgeable scientists who favour aggressive steps and confused laypeople who don’t.
Walsh wants experts to “better explain in clear English the dynamics of the climate system, and how to affect it”.
Matt Nisbet at Framing Science goes a little further: “What’s needed is not simply getting more scientific information out there, but rather new methods for communicating about the problem that are adapted to the background of targeted publics, journalists, and decision-makers.”
But I’m not convinced that the apparent crisis of understanding Sterman points to is really a crucial barrier.
Here's the background: research Sterman published last year with co-author Linda Booth Sweeney of Harvard found that even MIT grad students make rudimentary mistakes when asked how to stabilize atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations.
Nisbet sums up :
In the experiment, MIT students with advanced training in either the sciences or economics were asked to read descriptions from the IPCC summary for policymakers that depicted the long term accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere.
When asked then to sketch what they estimated to be the emissions path needed to stabilize atmospheric CO2, nearly 2/3 of the elite MIT students erroneously reasoned that greenhouse gas emissions can stabilize even though emissions would continue to exceed the rate of removal from the atmosphere.
The students typically thought that stabilizing carbon dioxide emissions at current levels would likewise stabilize carbon dioxide concentrations at current levels.
The right answer is that emissions need to be cut drastically - by over 50%, given the numbers in Sterman's example.
This is an instance of the more general problem where “people have difficulty relating the flows into and out of a stock to the level of the stock”, says Sterman.
Sterman takes something of a logical leap, though, in connecting this mistake with poll results showing that majorities in the US, Russia, China and India - all important emitters - favor a ‘wait and see’ or ‘go slow’ approach to lowering emissions.
(More on recent climate poll results in this post , by the way.
) He writes:
For most people, uncertainty about the risks of climate change means costly actions to reduce emissions should be deferred.
But that’s an answer to the question of when to take major measures against the risks foreseen by climate experts.
It’s not about what those measures would look like, in terms of emissions trajectories.
As Sterman himself notes, "'wait-and-see' works well in simple systems with short lags.
" The Earth's climate is not a simple system with short lags.
Sterman then downplays that unrealistic view in comparison to the stock-flow misconception.
But if the polls are flagging up one climate science message that hasn't come across, it's this: on a complex planet rife with both physical and bureaucratic inertia, decisions made today take decades to have a meaningful effect .
It'd surely help the AGW cause were anything incontrovertible to happen, that could only be linked to anthropogenic climate change.
Skepticism would go out of fashion, and populations will be willingly corral themselves into action.
But even if no such "smoking gun" has yet materialized, still we're presumed to do something big right now, because we're told that we "cannot afford" to wait for...that smoking gun to materialize.
I am asked the following question at least 10 times a week by various people.
Is it (glacier retreat) due to global warming, many think so, but are looking for confirmation.
Even where the evidence is so clear it has still left people uncertain enough to not press for action.
A modern analogy is the credit crisis, as foreclosures began to rise 18 months ago, the information as getting out of this looming crisis.
No significant action was taken, and the it to our surprise turned out to be a real crisis.
online resource dedicated to in-depth coverage of climate science and the implications for policy, the economy and society.
Economists have been estimating the monetary benefits of the environment for quite a few years (e.g., see Table 1 of this review for a 1993 version published in the American Economic Association's Journal of Economic Perspectives).
Therefore, it puzzles me when I come across stuff like this at Climate Progress commenting on the IPI benefit-cost analysis of Waxman-Markey :
Using the value of $19 per ton of carbon pollution avoided, the authors determined that the total midrange projection of Waxman-Markey’s benefits is $1.5 trillion total between 2012-2050.
Projections estimate that the legislation would require $660 billion in investment during this time, which means that benefits are at least two times greater than costs ...
Until now, advocates of progress have had few estimates of economic benefits of action.
This is a credible estimate of the benefits of action, and it far outweighs the investment cost of building a clean energy economy.
The Environmental Protection Agency must take the next step by conducting a more thorough, rigorous analysis of benefits to conclusively demonstrate that Americans will have a net economic benefit from clean energy and global warming legislation.
"Until now"?
The federal government estimate of the benefits of climate change mitigation used in the IPI study is the result of a serious literature review.
They didn't come up with those benefit numbers themselves, they relied on economic research conducted by folks " who can't walk and chew gum " at the same time.
Economists are either (a) doing a poor job communicating with environmentalists or (b) environmentalists hate economists so much that they can't listen or (c) good economics is that which you agree with or (d) some combination of (a), (b) and (c).The thing about social science, maybe even science science, is there is good news (benefits) and bad news (costs).
Economists deliver both so my advice to Climate Progress is don't kill the messenger .
A great opportunity for economists to speak to climate scientists and vice versa is through the Union of Concerned Scientists.
UCS has been actively reaching out to economists for a couple of years now through efforts like the Scientists and Economists Call to Action.
We just brought a group of economist experts from all over the country together for a weekend workshop in DC on climate science, environmental economics, and working with the media on policy initiatives.
See http://www.ucsusa.org/globalwarming/.
... the Environmental Economics blog ... is now the default homepage on my browser (but then again, I guess I am a wonk -- a word I learned on the E.E.
blog). That is a very nice service to the profession.
Climate change will have significant impacts in both Australia and across the globe.
Australia is one of the most arid continents in the world.
It is vulnerable to risks such as disruptions to water supply; increases in the severity of storms, floods and droughts, coastal erosion due to sea level rise; and to negative human health impacts, for example through an increase in the range and spread of disease.
[1] The impacts of climate change are also a particular concern in the Asia Pacific region.
According to the fifth report from the Working Group on Climate Change and Development, Up in Smoke?
Asia and the Pacific, which was released in November 2007, ‘the human drama of climate change will largely be played out in Asia, where over 60 per cent of the world’s population, around 4 billion people, live’.
[2]
In responding to climate change, governments have traditionally approached it as an ecological problem or more recently, as an economic one.
To date the social and human rights implications of climate change have received little attention.
[3] Yet the human costs of climate change directly threaten fundamental human rights; rights to life, to food, to a place to live and work, rights that governments have an obligation to protect.
As Kyung-wha Kang, the UN Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights has stated:
Global warming and extreme weather conditions may have calamitous consequences for the human rights of millions of people...ultimately climate change may affect the very right to life of various individuals...[countries] have an obligation to prevent and address some of the direst consequences that climate change may reap on human rights.
[4]
Equity issues also arise in the climate change context because of its disproportionate impact on already vulnerable people and communities.
As articulated by the UK Secretary of State for the Environment, ‘socially, climate change raises profound questions of justice and equity: between generations, between the developing and developed worlds; between rich and poor within each country.
The challenge is to find an equitable distribution of responsibilities and rights.’[5]
What then, if anything, does the modern human rights discourse offer or require from governments when developing appropriate responses to the impacts of climate change?
The answer, it appears, is ‘a lot’.
As noted by the Deputy High Commissioner, states have a positive obligation to protect individuals against the threat posed to human rights by climate change, regardless of the causes.
The most effective means of facilitating this is to adopt a ‘human rights-based approach’ to policy and legislative responses to climate change; an approach that is normatively based on international human rights standards and that is practically directed to promoting and protecting human rights.
Part I of this paper considers the dimension of Human Rights and Climate Change.
Specifically, it looks at how the rights contained in the key international instruments are threatened by the impacts of climate change.
Part II then goes on to consider what obligations are imposed on Australia, in both international and domestic law, to respond to these threats.
Part III outlines how Australia may fulfil its human rights obligations, in the context of climate change responses; arguing that a human rights-based approach is the most effective way to respond to climate change.
As promised, Nature’s film on climate change went online last week on October 1.
You can view the film in full on nature.com (it lasts about twenty minutes in total).
It will also be on YouTube next week, at which stage I’ll embed it here.
The film was shot this July on location in Lindau at the 59th meeting of Nobel Laureates , and follows three young researchers – Brian Krohn, Faroha Liquat and Brandi Kiel Reese – on a journey to discover how their work on various aspects of chemistry can help solve the climate change problem.
Faroha Liquat, a PhD researcher based at Quaid-i-Azam University in Pakistan, is interested in devising novel ways to harness the power of the sun for the benefit of mankind.
She’s especially interested in developing cost-effective photovoltaic cells.
During the film, she has a very valuable interaction with the IPCC's Rajendra Pachauri on whether developing countries can prosper and be part of the climate change solution.
She’s currently visiting Pachauri’s institute, TERI, in Delhi .
During their week at Lindau, our young researchers hear about the changes already underway from climate experts, they challenge (and in some cases agree with) the views of political scientist Bjørn Lomborg, and they learn about the social responsibilities of scientists from the Nobel Laureates who first discovered the danger of CFCs.
Through these interactions, they explore the challenge of keeping global temperatures to within the 2 °C target.
Their take: we have the brains and the tools to solve this problem, we just need the political willpower.
Despite the expert nature of many of our interview subjects, the film provides a great overview of the climate change problem for anyone in need of an update in the run-up to Copenhagen.
Imagining we can control the climate is a fantasy that seems to be part of the Climate Munchausen Syndrome whereby disturbed people see climate disorders in a planet which is just chugging along in much the same as it has done for thousands of years.
online resource dedicated to in-depth coverage of climate science and the implications for policy, the economy and society.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has published a report, Climate Change United States Indicators, to help readers interpret a set of important indicators to better understand climate change.
The report presents 24 indicators, each describing trends in some way related to the causes and effects of climate change.
The indicators focus primarily on Climate Change United States, but in some cases global trends are presented in order to provide context or a basis for comparison.
The 24 Climate Change United States Indicators are as follows (links are to internal pages):
Greenhouse Gases : The indicators in this chapter characterize the amount of greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere through human activities, the concentra¬tions of these gases in the atmosphere, and how emissions and concentrations have changed over time.
Weather and Climate : This chapter focuses on indicators related to weather and climate patterns, including temperature, precipitation, storms, droughts, and heat waves.
These indicators of Climate Change United States can reveal long-term changes in the Earth’s climate system.
Oceans : The world’s oceans have a two-way relationship with climate.
The oceans influence climate on regional and global scales, while changes in climate can fundamentally alter certain properties of the ocean.
This chapter examines trends in ocean characteristics that relate to climate change, such as acidity, temperature, heat storage, and sea level.
Snow and Ice : Climate change can dramatically alter the Earth’s snow- and ice-covered areas.
These changes, in turn, can affect air temperatures, sea levels, ocean currents, and storm patterns.
This chapter focuses on trends in glaciers; the extent and depth of snow cover; and the freezing and thawing of oceans and lakes.
Society and Ecosystems : Changes in the Earth’s climate can affect public health, agriculture, energy production and use, land use and development, and recreation.
Climate change can also disrupt the functioning of ecosystems and increase the risk of harm or even extinction for some species.
This chapter looks at just a few of the impacts that may be linked to climate change, including heat-related illnesses and changes in plant growth.
EPA looks forward to expanding this chapter in future reports as the science evolves and the capacity to report on these types of indicators is broadened.
U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions.
In the Climate Change United States greenhouse gas emissions caused by human activities increased by 14 percent from 1990 to 2008.
Carbon dioxide accounts for most of the nation’s emissions and most of this increase.
Electricity generation is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, followed by transporta¬tion.
Emissions per person have remained about the same since 1990.
Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions .
Worldwide, emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities increased by 26 percent from 1990 to 2005.
Emissions of carbon dioxide, which account for nearly three-fourths of the total, increased by 31 percent over this period.
Like in the Climate Change United States, the majority of the world’s emissions are associated with energy use.
Atmospheric Concentrations of Greenhouse Gases.
Concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have risen substantially since the beginning of the industrial era.
Almost all of this increase is attributable to human activities.
Historical measurements show that the current levels of many greenhouse gases are higher than any seen in thousands of years, even after accounting for natural fluctuations.
Climate Forcing .
Climate or “radiative” forcing is a way to measure how substances such as greenhouse gases affect the amount of energy that is absorbed by the atmosphere.
An increase in radiative forcing leads to warming while a decrease in forcing produces cooling.
From 1990 to 2008, the radiative forcing of all the greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere increased by about 26 percent.
The rise in carbon dioxide concentrations accounts for approximately 80 percent of this increase.
U.S. and Global Temperature .
Average temperatures have risen across the lower 48 states since 1901, with an increased rate of warming over the past 30 years.
Seven of the top 10 warmest years on record for the lower 48 states have occurred since 1990, and the last 10 five-year periods have been the warmest five-year periods on record.
Average global temperatures show a similar trend, and 2000–2009 was the warmest decade on record worldwide.
Within the Climate Change United States, parts of the North, the West, and Alaska have seen temperatures increase the most.
Heat Waves .
The frequency of heat waves in the United States decreased in the 1960s and 1970s, but has risen steadily since then.
The percentage of the United States experiencing heat waves has also increased.
The most severe heat waves in U.S. history remain those that occurred during the “Dust Bowl” in the 1930s, although average temperatures have increased since then.
Drought .
Over the period from 2001 through 2009, roughly 30 to 60 percent of the U.S. land area experienced drought conditions at any given time.
However, the data for this indicator have not been collected for long enough to determine whether droughts are increasing or decreasing over
U.S. and Global Precipitation.
Average precipitation has increased in the United States and worldwide.
Since 1901, precipitation has increased at an average rate of more than 6 percent per century in the lower 48 states and nearly 2 percent per century worldwide.
However, shifting weather patterns have caused certain areas, such as Hawaii and parts of the Southwest, to experience less precipitation than they used to.
Heavy Precipitation .
In recent years, a higher percentage of precipitation in the Climate Change United States has come in the form of intense single-day events.
Eight of the top 10 years for extreme one-day precipitation events have occurred since 1990.
The occurrence of abnormally high annual precipitation totals has also increased.
Tropical Cyclone Intensity.
The intensity of tropical storms in the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico did not exhibit a strong long term trend for much of the 20th century, but has risen noticeably over the past 20 years.
Six of the 10 most active hurricane seasons have occurred since the mid-1990s.
This increase is closely related to variations in sea surface temperature in the tropical Atlantic.
Ocean Acidity .
The ocean has become more acidic over the past 20 years, and studies suggest that the ocean is substantially more acidic now than it was a few centuries ago.
Rising acidity is associated with increased levels of carbon dioxide dissolved in the water.
Changes in acidity can affect sensitive organisms such as corals.
Arctic Sea Ice.
Part of the Arctic Ocean stays frozen year-round.
The area covered by ice is typically smallest in September, after the summer melting season.
September 2007 had the least ice of any year on record, followed by 2008 and 2009.
The extent of Arctic sea ice in 2009 was 24 percent below the 1979 to 2000 historical average.
Glaciers .
Glaciers in the Climate Change United States and around the world have generally shrunk since the 1960s, and the rate at which glaciers are melting appears to have accelerated over the last decade.
Overall, glaciers worldwide have lost more than 2,000 cubic miles of water since 1960, which has contributed to the observed rise in sea level.
Lake Ice.
When looking at lakes in the northern Climate Change United States scenario, lakes generally appear to be freezing later and thawing earlier than they did in the 1800s and early 1900s.
The length of time that lakes stay frozen has decreased at an average rate of one to two days per decade.
Heat-Related Deaths .
Over the past three decades, more than 6,000 deaths across the United States were caused by heat-related illness such as heat stroke.
However, in the Climate Change United States analysis considerable year-to-year variability makes it difficult to determine long-term trends.
Length of Growing Season.
The average length of the growing season in the lower 48 states has increased by about two weeks since the beginning of the 20th century.
A particularly large and steady increase has occurred over the last 30 years.
The observed changes reflect earlier spring warming as well as later arrival of fall frosts.
The length of the growing season has increased more rapidly in the West than in the East.
Leaf and Bloom Dates.
Leaf growth and flower blooms are examples of natural events whose timing can be influenced by climate change.
Climate Change United States observations of lilacs and honeysuck¬les in the lower 48 states suggest that leaf growth is now occurring a few days earlier than it did in the early 1900s.
Lilacs and honeysuckles are also blooming slightly earlier than in the past, but it is difficult to determine whether this change is statistically meaningful.
Bird Wintering Ranges .
Some birds shift their range or alter their migration habits to adapt to changes in temperature or other environmental conditions.
Long-term studies have found that bird species in North America have shifted their wintering grounds northward by an average of 35 miles since 1966, with a few species shifting by several hundred miles.
Observations for Climate Change United States found on average, bird species have also moved their wintering grounds farther from the coast, consistent with rising inland temperatures.

Mojib Latif denies his research supports theory that current cold weather undermines scientific consensus on global warming
A leading scientist has hit out at misleading newspaper reports that linked his research to claims that the current cold weather undermines the scientific case for manmade global warming.
Mojib Latif, a climate expert at the Leibniz Institute at Kiel University in Germany, said he "cannot understand" reports that used his research to question the scientific consensus on climate change .
He told the Guardian: "It comes as a surprise to me that people would try to use my statements to try to dispute the nature of global warming.
I believe in manmade global warming.
I have said that if my name was not Mojib Latif it would be global warming.
"
He added: "There is no doubt within the scientific community that we are affecting the climate, that the climate is changing and responding to our emissions of greenhouse gases.
"
The reports attempted to link the Arctic weather that has enveloped the UK with research published by Latif's team in the journal Nature in 2008 .
The research said that natural fluctuations in ocean temperature could have a bigger impact on global temperature than expected.
In particular, the study concluded that cooling in the oceans could offset global warming, with the average temperature over the decades 2000-2010 and 2005-2015 predicted to be no higher than the average for 1994-2004.
Despite clarifications from the scientists at the time, who stressed that the research did not challenge the predicted long-term warming trend, the study was widely misreported as signalling a switch from global warming to global cooling.
It said: "The BBC assured viewers that the big chill was was merely short-term 'weather' that had nothing to do with 'climate', which was still warming.
The work of Prof Latif and the other scientists refutes that view.
"
He said the ocean temperature effect was similar to other natural influences on global temperature, such as volcanos, which cool the planet temporarily as ash spewed into the atmosphere reflects sunlight.
"The natural variation occurs side by side with the manmade warming.
Sometimes it has a cooling effect and can offset this warming and other times it can accelerate it.
" Other scientists have questioned the strength of the ocean effect on overall temperature and disagree that global warming will show the predicted pause.
Latif said his research suggested that up to half the warming seen over the 20th century was down to this natural ocean effect, but said that was consistent with the 2007 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
"No climate specialist would ever say that 100% of the warming we have seen is down to greenhouse gas emissions.
"
The recent articles are not the first to misrepresent his research, Latif said.
"There are numerous newspapers, radio stations and television channels all trying to get our attention.
Some overstate and some want to downplay the problem as a way to get that attention," he said.
"We are trying to discuss in the media a highly complex issue.
Nobody would discuss the problem of [Einstein's theory of] relativity in the media.
But because we all experience the weather, we all believe that we can assess the global warming problem.
"
Climate Change deniers seek to confuse the issue to prevent or postpone any meaningful action that can be done to get us out of our fossil fuel dependence and solve the climate problem, and this is just another example of it!
I would say that his work undermines the warmist claim to be scientific.
If you click on the link above you can see that his forecast is for a slight cooling in some areas, no change in others during the next decade.
He may well be right about that and he may well be right that it does not alter the "fact" of global warming.
But it puts the warming theory in a position where whatever happens it will be right.
If it warms, well that is a demonstration that the theory is right.
If it cools well that is also a demonstraion that the theory is right.
The theory cannot be falsified and is thus more akin to a religion than a science, at least if we accept Popper's definition of what constitutes a scientific theory.
The ACC predictions climatologists are talking about are over time scales of decades to a century.
Cooling over these timescales WOULD negate climate change theory whereas warming would confirm it.
Recent decades confirm it.
What is this nonsense?
Does the Guardian have some sort of vested interest in promoting the warmist agenda when it is to all extent falling apart at the seams, quite irrespective of the current bout of cold weather?
David Adam's interest is presumably his job, like the many other thousands of hangers-on and parasites who would have to search for some sort of useful occupation if they were forced to admit that anthropogenic global warming was essentially a vastly over-hyped scare story with the most dubious scientific foundations.
And as for the quixotic measures proposed to resolve the 'problem'...
Dr Latif remarks that 'I believe in manmade global warming', which sounds pretty much like the start of the environmentalist's Nicene Creed, or perhaps more like 'I believe in the Second Coming' or 'I believe that the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse will appear in the sky on December 31, 2049'.
This has become an almost religious belief that it has become sacrilege to cast doubt upon, as if the near-death of Christianity in the modern era has made people yearn for its archetypal representations as manifest by the medieval Inquisition.
But what is this 'scientific consensus' about global warming?
There is no such thing.
To quote the world's leading atmospheric scientist, Prof. Richard Lindzen of MIT, 'Future generations will wonder in bemused amazement that the early 21st century's developed world went into hysterical panic over a globally average temperature increase of a few tenths of a degree and, on the basis of gross exaggerations of highly uncertain computer projections combined into implausible chains of inference, proceeded to contemplate a roll-back of the industrial age.
' Consensus, my foot!
The "climate change debate" can't be engaged by the public anymore than the latest theories on quantum mechanics or molecular biology.
No, we are contemplating breaking our addiction to fossil fuels that are in limited supply anyway and advocating stopping further deforestation.
Talk about implausible chains of inference!
like the many other thousands of hangers-on and parasites who would have to search for some sort of useful occupation if they were forced to admit that anthropogenic global warming was essentially a vastly over-hyped scare story with the most dubious scientific foundations.
The REAL money would be in science that dismissed ACC theory since it is clear that the vested interests in maintaining business as usual i.e.
oil, coal, cement, agribusiness, roads, cars, etc etc are the ones with the cash.
Trouble is there ISN'T any science that dismisses the fact of man-made climate change.
But we aren't discussing the science.
we are discussing science denial.
Unfortunately governments don't change direction unless pressurised to do so and for that to happen the general public has to see where their true interests lie - with keeping in line with the propaganda of the swivel-eyed right and the industrial vested interests or doing what is best for the long-term well-being of the biosphere upon which we ALL depend for our survival.
If global warming is lies how do you think that works?
Or maybe climate science is just filled with idiots, not liars at all and anyone who glances at the data can see that there is no such thing as global warming?
But we aren't discussing the science.
we are discussing science denial.
Unfortunately governments don't change direction unless pressurised to do so and for that to happen the general public has to see where their true interests lie - with keeping in line with the propaganda of the swivel-eyed right and the industrial vested interests or doing what is best for the long-term well-being of the biosphere upon which we ALL depend for our survival.
Even in regards to the issue of climate change alone, short-term gain is always going to win out because that's just how people think.
The chances of a "pay now for later gain" party ever getting elected is basically zero.
But seriously, the quality of a lot of the climate posters on cif never ceased to amaze me, we know who we are talking about, Deconvoluter, Teratornis, VTG, etc etc for the grace and finesse and MeFinny2 playing the Chopper Harris role.
There are still a few who seem to be putting in the hard work (let's hear it for Legjoints) but really we need GPWayne to awaken from his slumber and rise like King Arthur to lead us to victory.
Depressing isn't it.
Or, put another way, welcome to "Cif Climate"!
What part about the difference between climate and weather is it that you don't understand?
Look at the temperature trends on the decade time scale.
The temperature continues to rise.
Here it is again.
The climate is truely fascinating for those with an open mind.
Reality is much more interesting than narrow minded paranoid deusions.
Can someone please help me here?
Up until yesterday I believed in global warming.
And then this Mojib Latif shows up with research results that definitely confirm that the world goes through cycles of climate change and is now - after a period of warming - entering a period of cooling and that is why, for example, the Arctic ice shelf has been growing in the past few years and we will be experiencing for the next 15 or so years more cold winters like the one now.
And now he stands up and says he also believes in global warming.
Seeing as no one denies that the world goes through climate cycles, what is the point of bringing them up?
The point is that it's noise and the evidence for anthropogenic climate change is the discovery of a very clear signal against the background noise.
Simply showing that there is noise doesn't make the signal go away.
That said, if we were going to anything about the human contribution to climate change, it would have had to have been done 20 years ago, and government inaction has meant that it is now too late.
So called green taxes don't help either because they allow people to continue adding to the problem if they are willing to pay more tax.
None of the money raised is used to pay for climate change counter measures; it's just a way to raise tax instead on icome based tax, which most people in th UK will vote for because they think it will not hit them in the pocket, but of course it hits most people more that income tax would.
We need to accept that climate change has been happening, and will continue to happen even if we now take action.
We need to plan ahead for the impact of climate change.
Particulary we need to consider coastal erosion policy, insurance cover, building standards, transport during adverse weather, health impacts of heat waves and cold periods, and energy security and peak demands.
Also possible impacts on food availability, both locally and globally.
Energy efficiency and renewables are undoubtedly part of the action needed, but even if we moved to 100% green energy tommorow (in the UK or globally), climate change will still happen.
I answered two points.
First the scientific question - is the warmist view scientific?
Second I turned to the temperature because of your point where you say "The ACC predictions climatologists are talking about are over time scales of decades to a century.
Cooling over these timescales WOULD negate climate change theory whereas warming would confirm it.
Recent decades confirm it.
"
You go on to say to janet999 "But we aren't discussing the science.
we are discussing science denial.
" My point is really that you are not discussing science.
If we find that the world cools or does not alter in temperature for a decade and we then say the cooling or lack of warming is nevertheless consistent with the theory of global warming, we are dealing with a theory that is beyond refutation and for that reason alone it is not a scientific theory.
It does not matter how many people with glasses, white coats and important sounding titles are involved.
If there are no circumstances that could ever show the theory to be incorrect then it is more akin to a religion, it is not a science.
Rory Carroll speaks to members of the Uru Chipaya tribe, whose lifestyle in the Bolivian Andes is being threatened by the effects of global warming
Europe attempted to reassert its international leadership in the fight against global warming today, offering to slash its greenhouse gas emissions by up to 95% by 2050 and by 30% by 2020 if a climate change pact is sealed in Copenhagen in six weeks' time.
But his optimism contrasted with the increasing doubts around the world enough time remains to deliver a binding agreement in Copenhagen.
The EU also still has to settle disputes over the EU's carbon trading scheme and how the developing world will be paid to cope with the impacts of global warming.
Yesterday, European finance ministers failed to agree on a funding package for developing countries, with Poland and other poorer eastern European countries unhappy at being asked to subsidise action in countries such as China and India whose economies are growing strongly.
Poland is also leading the dissent on the EU emissions trading scheme (ETS).
The EU negotiating position offers to slash greenhouse gas emissions by between 80-95% by 2050 and to deepen cuts from 20 to 30% by 2020 if other world powers sign up for similar action.
The ministers said they also reached accord on tough action on deforestation and agreed that aviation would have to cut its emissions by 10% by 2020 compared with 2005 levels and shipping by 20%.
However, reluctance from the big players – the US, China, and India – to unveil targets or specific figures for a climate change pact, the EU was divided over tactics ahead of the UN conference in Copenhagen in December.
"Environment ministers are determined that the EU maintains its leadership position on climate change in order to promote an ambitious deal at Copenhagen," said Ed Miliband, the UK energy and climate change secretary.
"The level of ambition demonstrated by environment ministers will not deliver a fair and just global climate agreement in Copenhagen," said Sonja Meister, climate campaign coordinator for Friends of the Earth.
"Europe must go much further than this and live up to its historical responsibilities by committing to cut emissions by 40% domestically by 2020.

Environmental activists, indigenous leaders and Hollywood celebrities are gathering in Bolivia this week for the People's World Conference on Climate Change on climate change
Scientists to Congress: You can argue about the politics all you want, but if you decide not to act on climate change, it won’t be because the science wasn’t strong enough.
In a letter sent today, a slew of scientific organizations, including the American Meteorological Society, American Geophysical Union, Crop Science Society of America, and American Chemical Society, informed the U.S. Senate that there is a strong scientific consensus that manmade greenhouse gases are changing the climate and that claims to the contrary are scientifically indefensible:
“Observations throughout the world make it clear that climate change is occurring, and rigorous scientific research demonstrates that the greenhouse gases emitted by human activities are the primary driver.
These conclusions are based on multiple independent lines of evidence, and contrary assertions are inconsistent with an objective assessment of the vast body of peer-reviewed science.”
And they go further: “there is strong evidence that ongoing climate change will have broad impacts on society, including the global economy and on the environment.” They also say the United States will experience significant impacts; climate change isn’t just a problem for poor or developing countries :
Notably, eight agricultural, plant, and ecological organizations signed the letter, thoroughly undermining recent attempts by opponents of climate policy to spin manmade CO
emissions as “plant food” that’s good for the environment.
The letter, signed by 18 scientific groups, warns that: "For the United States, climate change impacts include sea level rise for coastal states, greater threats of extreme weather events, and increased risk of regional water scarcity, urban heat waves, western wildfires, and the disturbance of biological systems throughout the country.” More CO
This is the first time that so many professional scientific organizations have spoken in unison on the need for climate change policy:
“If we are to avoid the most severe impacts of climate change, emissions of greenhouse gases must be dramatically reduced.
In addition, adaptation will be necessary to address those impacts that are already unavoidable.”
You won’t find a political statement in the letter to the senators.
Instead, you’ll find a professional community united against politically motivated denialism designed to deceive the public and Congress about what scientists know about climate change.
You’ll also find a community of professional problem solvers eager to help our nation find the needed solutions, if and when our policy makers finally decide to act.
First, the sophisticated understanding of the climate system that has developed over the past century is a truly historic achievement shared by thousands of professionals representing many scientific disciplines in dozens of countries.
Claiming that we don’t know enough about climate change to do anything about it unfairly diminishes this accomplishment and stands as an affront to the profession.
As a scientist, I would have preferred to see our professional community come together like this sooner, but scientists are a fractious bunch and are politically shy.
It speaks volumes about the seriousness of climate change that they have come together at all!

In the last century growth in human populations has increased energy use.
This has contributed additional carbon dioxide (CO
) and other gases to the atmosphere.
Although the AAPG membership is divided on the degree of influence that anthropogenic CO
has on recent and potential global temperature increases, the AAPG believes that expansion of scientific climate research into the basic controls on climate is important.
This research should be undertaken by appropriate federal agencies involved in climate research and their associated grant and contract programs.
Geologists study the history of the earth and realize climate has changed often in the past due to natural causes.
The Earth’s climate naturally varies constantly, in both directions, at varying rates, and on many scales.
In recent decades global temperatures have risen.
Yet, our planet has been far warmer and cooler than today many times in the geologic past, including the past 10,000 years.
Certain climate simulation models predict that the warming trend will continue, as reported through NAS, AGU, AAAS, and AMS.
AAPG respects these scientific opinions but wants to add that the current climate warming projections could fall within well-documented natural variations in past climate and observed temperature data.
These data do not necessarily support the maximum case scenarios forecast in some models.
To be predictive, any model of future climate should also accurately model known climate and greenhouse gas variations recorded in the geologic history of the past 200,000 years.
Read AAPG's publication that further discusses worldwide climate.
The first chapter of Geological Perspectives of Global Climate Change is provided here as a PDF.
AAPG supports expanding scientific climate research into the basic controls on climate specifically including the geological, solar and astronomic aspects of climate change.
Research should include understanding causes of past climate change and the potential effects of both increasing and decreasing temperatures in the future.
AAPG supports thepursuit of economically viable technology to sequester carbon dioxide emissions and emissions of other gases in a continuing effort to improve our environment and enhance energy recovery.
So much of the wailing and gnashing of teeth around the climate bill in Congress revolves around the costs of curbing greenhouse-gas emissions.
What about the benefits?
That is, seemingly everybody—the Environmental Protection Agency, the Congressional Budget Office, the Energy Information Administration, not to mention private-sector lobbies—has tried to tally how much it will cost to nudge America toward cleaner energy and fewer greenhouse-gas emissions.
None have sought to figure out what kind of benefits the bill could bring.
That got some folks thinking.
“Climate change is arguably one of the most complex issues to face Congress in recent memory, and yet Congress is essentially conducting its deliberations after having reviewed barely half the data,” says a new brief out from NYU Law School’s Institute for Policy Integrity, an outfit basically created to bring cost-benefit analysis back to the environmental arena.
The upshot?
As flawed as it may be, the Waxman-Markey climate bill makes economic sense, offering benefits worth at least twice as much as it costs, if not more.
The authors set out to see how much a ton of carbon is worth—not what it trades for on carbon exchanges, but how much a ton of carbon not emitted to the atmosphere is worth society in terms of avoiding climate change.
Now, there are some important caveats.
That “cost of carbon” is a global cost; the U.S. doesn’t face quite the same risk from climate change as, say, Bangladesh.
Which means all the “benefits” cited in the paper are similarly global, even if the costs are not: “A large portion of benefits might not be felt directly or immediately within U.S. borders,” the paper notes, suggesting that U.S. voters think of it as a “highly effective, highly leveraged form of foreign aid.”
Of course, the Senate still faces attacks from the right and the left when it comes to the climate bill.
Will a move to tally not just the costs but the potential benefits of the bill make the Senate’s job any easier?
As a scientist, the article and the referenced study are disappointing to me.
The underlying premise that there is a direct correlation between atmospheric GHG and ‘warming’ and weather pattern changes has NOT been demonstrated.
This is simply taken as given.
On the contrary, what has been demonstrated is that solar activity is much more highly correlated to observed data.
Where is it written down that the earth’s climate is static?
All the data says otherwise.
Meanwhile, individuals and small businesses are struggling to make ends meet due to the current economic climate.
Most of these people saw their savings/retirement cut nearly in half, are struggling to run their businesses, or just to pay the bills.
These are hard working, taxpaying, Americans.
No matter how bad it has been during this “recession” these are the people that tightened their belts in order to make their mortgage payments.
Yet it is they whom will receive NO benefit whatsoever from this (since the product {gasoline, oil, electricity} they consume will be essentially no different than it is today.
The Primary difference is that after Cap and Trade, THESE FAMILIES, INDIVIDUALS, AND BUSINESSES WILL BE FORCED TO PAY SIGNIFICANTLY MORE FOR THE SAME THING THEY ALREADY HAVE.
The PERI study expressly states that there is an intentional redistribution of wealth component built in through subsidies and vouchers for some Americans (I will go ahead and speculate that the majority of the beneficiaries of said vouchers are already on some form of government assistance, and are what some refer to as the “chronic poor”… If they can push this through, this is the “GIMME” to their core constituents (the chronic poor/minorities) in return for votes.
Remember, midterm elections are coming up soon!
THIS IS SOCIALISM… If you want to go be a socialist (Or a Progressive, or even a Communist), there are places where these ideologies are accepted of even prevalent
If the government were really concerned with the environment they would eliminate public school buses as they are huge sources of pollution and no source for anything good.
The public school system has failed in so many ways and is somewhat responsible itself for causing America to be largest per capita user of energy in the world.
They don’t teach students how to really be conservative with their energy.
If public schooling were eliminated a vast amount of energy would be saved from not having those buses and school buildings to run.
People wouldn’t be any less smart because as it is a large majority leave high school not being able to read.
The big debate over climate legislation seems to be boiling down not to polar bears, ice sheets or light-switch taxes, but simply to jobs.
The pro (anti)-climate legislation forces argue that climate legislation will create (destroy) millions of jobs.
Both sides are wrong as climate legislation, and any environmental policy (past or future) will have limited macroeconomic impact over the long term.
Whether you support or oppose climate legislation should depend on how you feel about its real impacts (impacts on the environment and changes in the industrial sector of the U.S.) and your rate of time preference: if you use a high (low) discount rate then the future does not matter much and you oppose (are in favor of) climate legislation.
I was at the senate finance committee’s hearing on allowance distribution under climate change legislation earlier this week.
It was really interesting to see how engaged the senators were considering how much of their attention health care is taking.
Tessera Solar plans to plant 34,000 solar dishes — each one 40 feet high and 38 feet wide — on 8,230 acres of the Mojave Desert in Southern California.
Although the lengthy licensing process for the Calico solar farm remains in the early stages, several environmental groups are already raising red flags about the massive project’s impact on such protected wildlife as the desert tortoise, the Mojave fringe-toed lizard and Nelson’s bighorn sheep.

IMPACTS OF CLIMATE AND ENERGY POLICY ACROSS THE STATES
Billy Pizer , formerly of RFF and now in charge (kinda) of negotiating climate change treaties at the US Treasury, gave this list of "things to do" at his EAERE keynote ("Facing the Climate Change Challenge").
Environmental change, including climate change, can cause rapid phenotypic change via both ecological and evolutionary processes.
Because ecological and evolutionary dynamics are intimately linked, a major challenge is to identify their relative roles.
We exactly decompose change in mean body weight in a free-living population of Soay sheep into all processes that contribute to change.
Ecological processes contribute most, with selection—the underpinning of adaptive evolution—explaining little of the observed phenotypic trend.
Our results enable us to explain why selection is not realized even though weight is heritable and why environmental change has caused a decline in Soay sheep body size.
So, OK, I'll give it a whirl.
My analysis: climate change will hurt the sheep industry.
It is unclear whether climbers will be negatively affected by the indirect impacts of climate change on sheep size.
Sweetening cow breath is a matter of some urgency, climate scientists say.
Cows have digestive bacteria in their stomachs that cause them to belch methane, the second-most-significant heat-trapping emission associated with global warming after carbon dioxide.
Although it is far less common in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide, it has 20 times the heat-trapping ability.
... the Environmental Economics blog ... is now the default homepage on my browser (but then again, I guess I am a wonk -- a word I learned on the E.E.
blog). That is a very nice service to the profession.
The global energy balance is the balance between incoming energy from the Sun and outgoing heat from the Earth.
The global energy balance regulates the state of the Earth's climate, and modifications to it as a result of natural and man-made climate forcing , cause the global climate to change.
Energy released from the Sun as electromagnetic radiation has a temperature of approximately 6000°C.
At this temperature, electromagnetic radiation is emitted as shortwave light and ultraviolet energy.
Electromagnetic radiation travels across space at the speed of light.
When it reaches the Earth's, some is reflected back to space by clouds, some is absorbed by the atmosphere , and some is absorbed at the Earth's surface.
The Earth releases a lot of energy it has received from the Sun back to space.
However, since the Earth is much cooler than the Sun, its radiating energy is longer wavelength infrared energy or heat.
Sometimes, we can indirectly see heat radiation, for example as heat shimmers rising from a tarmac road on a hot sunny day.
The energy received by the Earth from the Sun balances the energy lost by the Earth back into space.
In this way, the Earth maintains a stable average temperature and therefore a stable climate (although of course differences in climate exist at different locations around the world).
The Earth atmosphere contains a number of greenhouse gases , which affect the Sun-Earth energy balance.
The average global temperature is in fact 33°C higher than it should be.
Greenhouse gases absorb electromagnetic radiation at some wavelengths but allow radiation at other wavelengths to pass through unimpeded.
The atmosphere is mostly transparent in the visible light (which is why we can see the Sun), but significant blocking (through absorption) of ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer, and infrared radiation by greenhouse gases, occurs.
The absorption of infrared radiation trying to escape from the Earth back to space is particularly important to the global energy balance.
Such energy absorption by the greenhouse gases heats the atmosphere , and so the Earth stores more energy near its surface than it would if there was no atmosphere.
The average surface temperature of the moon, about the same distance as the Earth from the Sun , is -18°C.
The moon, of course, has no atmosphere.
By contrast, the average surface temperature of the Earth is 15°C.
This heating effect is called the natural greenhouse effect .
The costs of inaction are high, and they fall unevenly across countries.
All countries will be affected, but it is clear that developing countries are the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, and they are likely to suffer disproportionately.
According to a recent OECD study , 9 out of 10 of the must vulnerable port cities are in developing countries.
Only one (Miami) is in an OECD country.
Mumbai has the highest number of people exposed to coastal flooding today, and by 2070 we expect that Kolkata (Calcutta) would take over this unfortunate “leadership”.
But ambitious climate change policies are affordable.
The forthcoming OECD Environmental Outlook shows that putting the world onto a pathway to stabilise greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at about 450 ppm CO2-equivalent would reduce GDP growth rates globally by an average of less than one-tenth of a percentage point (0.10%) per year from now to 2050.
This seems affordable given expected growth in living standards and the various calculations of the cost of inaction.
OECD is working on what shapes the incentives for different countries to participate in co-operative international action.
In some cases, there are direct or indirect co-benefits of climate policies.
For example, our recent analysis shows that achieving the ambitious climate target of 450 ppm would reduce air pollution significantly – sulphur dioxide emissions by 20-30% and nitrogen oxides by 30-40% by 2030.
All countries – but particularly developing countries -- will also need to build capacity to adapt to the impacts of inevitable climate changes already locked in due to past emissions.
OECD analysis has shown that a significant portion of ODA is directed at activities potentially affected by climate risk, for example investments in water supply and sanitation, or in transport infrastructure.
Our OECD Development Co-operation and Environment Ministers highlighted this last year, when they endorsed a Declaration on Integrating Climate Change Adaptation into Development Co-operation.
We are working now to develop guidance on how to do this better.
The policies needed to move towards a low-carbon economy are known and are available.
This includes taxes, tradable emissions permits, incentives for climate-friendly innovation, standards (such as building codes) and regulations – all of these are well known.
They can be combined in an effective policy “toolkit” to help to address climate change.
Emission trading schemes are spreading among OECD countries.
There is scope for learning about design features as we gain experience.
How can we avoid unnecessary price volatility?
How can we cover all gases and all sectors?
How can we move towards auctioning of emission rights, rather than grandfathering?
The world economy is expected to double and world population to grow by one-third by 2030.
With rising income and living standards, global consumption of fossil fuels, minerals, metals, timber and food crops is also growing.
For example, extraction of metal ores is projected to grow by 200% to 2020.
Expansion of mining and farming is putting pressures on biodiversity, polluting our rivers and aquifers, and exposing people to health risks.
And these environmental impacts of resource use are felt throughout the material “life-cycle”, from extraction and transportation, to use and disposal.
But prosperity does not need to increase the “weight of nation”.
By reducing, reusing and recycling, we can cut the need for virgin materials and improve resource efficiency.
This can also save energy and water, reduce waste and help mitigate climate change.
The challenge before us is to move towards a society where we create more value with less natural resource input, and where we leave room for future generations’ needs.
We also need global perspectives.
As international trade in goods and services grows, we are witnessing changing patterns of material flows within and among countries, with consequences for the location of the associated environmental impacts.
But we have reasons to be optimistic.
Today, we are at a turning point: government and business interests are converging to use natural resources and materials more efficiently.
Perceptions about what constitutes “waste” and how to manage material flows more sustainably are clearly changing, and changing fast.
Businesses are seeking new profits from better management of materials that were once regarded as waste.
They have invested in R&D and innovation to increase materials and energy efficiency in both production and consumption.
Companies are producing higher-value products with less material inputs.
“Design-for-Environment” targets are triggering companies to re-design their products to reduce material use and toxic inputs, and to make products more recyclable.
Mining industry has in place very effective Materials Stewardship programmes.
These initiatives are driven by concerns about reducing costs, but also by consumer demand for greener management of materials.
Promote new integrated approaches to counter-balance the environmental impacts of resource use throughout the entire life-cycle of materials--with stronger emphasis on material efficiency, product re-design and reuse, waste prevention, recycling and environmentally sound management of residues.
Set policy frameworks to promote resource efficiency by adopting full-cost resource pricing and volume-based waste charges, by removing market and trade barriers for recyclable materials, and by respecting international “rules of the game” on transboundary movements of waste, export credit, conduct of Multinational Enterprises and international investment to ensure that an international “Material-Cycle Society” is environmentally and economically sustainable
Enhance coherence among policies, not only on environment, natural resources and waste management, but also on trade, investment, technology and innovation.
For example, an OECD project is identifying barriers to trade in recyclable materials that might be removed by examining rules under the WTO and Basel Convention.
The OECD has long helped countries to promote sustainable materials and waste management.
This includes our work since the 1980s on transboundary movements of waste, which laid the foundation for the Basel convention.
And I am proud to report to you that this work has led to two OECD Council recommendations on Material Flows and Resource Productivity.
This means that OECD countries are committed to improve information, indicators and analyses on material flows and resource productivity, and to improve resource productivity and reduce negative environmental impacts of materials and product use.
This is one of our contributions to the G8 efforts on the 3Rs.
We have also examined policies that promote different aspects of the 3Rs, building on our expertise in economic analysis and country reviews, as well as waste management policies at national and international levels.
OECD analyses encompass aspects related to eco-innovation, sustainable manufacturing and trade in recyclable materials, as well as new work focusing on the potential for GHG mitigation from Integrated Material and Waste Management .
Kerry and Lieberman have apparently been waiting for a sign from above to release their climate and clean energy jobs bill, the American Power Act.
Instead, the unmistakable message that we need to get off of dirty, unsafe fossil fuels came from an undersea volcano of oil unleashed by the hubris, recklessness, and arrogance of Big Oil.
Before offering my thoughts on individual sections, here’s Dan Weiss, CAPAF’s Director of Climate Strategy:
“The Kerry-Lieberman American Power Act jump starts efforts to adopt comprehensive clean energy and climate polices that would cut oil use, increase security, reduce pollution and create jobs.
The BP oil disaster is like a signal flare warning us that we must reduce our oil use via investments in more efficient, cleaner energy technologies.
President Obama and Senate leaders must work together to craft a comprehensive program that achieves these goals.”
The auctioning is done along the lines I suggested here: How the Senate can fix cost containment in the climate bill with ‘price collar plus’ .
The floor price starts at $12 in 2013 and rises 3% plus inflation each year.
The ceiling starts at $25 increasing 5% plus inflation annually.
Moreover, I expect most of the offsets sold will be domestic ones — if we get an international deal (which is really only possible if we can pass a climate bill), then I expect international offsets will be fairly pricey by 2020.
And CBO said half of the domestic offsets are actual emission reductions in uncovered sectors.
There are a number of provisions to block market manipulation.
Now, there really wasn’t much possibility of market manipulation even in the House bill — see “ When Sen. Dorgan finds out what’s in the climate bill — hint, hint, White House — he might just support it .” It simply is very hard to corner the market and run up the price on a commodity that is highly fungible, like CO2 allowances, since in place of allowance you can reduce your energy use through efficiency, reduce your emissions through low carbon energy, fuel switch, buy a domestic offset, or buy an international offset.
Now that the bill limits participation in the auctions and has a hard ceiling, the prospects that the market could be seriously manipulated vanish entirely.
The bill creates “annual incentives of 2 billion per year for researching and developing effective carbon capture and sequestration methods and devices.” It also provides “significant incentives for the commercial deployment of 72 GW of carbon capture and sequestration.” Since I don’t expect we will see 72 GW of CCS until well past 2030, this isn’t going to cost taxpayers very much money (see Harvard study: “Realistic” first-generation CCS costs a whopping $150 per ton of CO2 — 20 cents per kWh!
). And if somebody does figure out how to do CCS practically and affordably — preferably with biomass cofiring — all the better (see Is coal with carbon capture and storage a core climate solution?
)
put in place the entire framework for U.S. climate regulations
31 Responses to “American Power Act to create millions of clean energy jobs, slash pollution and oil use, while boosting U.S. farmers and manufacturers”
Here we have it.
Congress is proposing to throw out a tool we know works on controlling pollution, the Clean Air Act, for a tenuous collection of subsidies for uneconomical nuclear and technologically non-existent green coal, collared credit prices with an unlimited safety valve, a demonstrably failed set of agricultural offsets, and 2020 targets that represent only marginal improvement over business as usual.
“Climate change and energy are in the news as the U.S. Senate, with much political drama, gears up to consider major legislation.
In the House passed version and in the Senate draft, many interests – manufacturers, farmers, utilities, and oil and gas companies – were successful in winning desired concessions.
Some ‘asks’ by industry are purely economic, part of the usual legislative give-and-take.
Others go to core aspects of environmental law and policy.
These requests go too far and should be rejected.
The Clean Air Act has served the country well.
First passed in 1970 and signed into law by President Richard Nixon, the Act is testimony to a concern for healthy air shared by Republicans and Democrats alike.
In the four decades since, the Act has cleaned up smokestacks, slashed smog and soot, cut acid rain, toxics and hazardous air pollution, held down pollution from cars, trucks and buses, and helped heal the ozone layer.
All the while, the Act has supported economic growth in America, both directly as technologies are invented and businesses built to solve pollution problems, and indirectly as Americans live healthier, more productive lives.
Yet, the pending climate bills would strip away key provisions of the Clean Air Act: the EPA is prohibited from ordering greenhouse gas cuts beyond those in the bill.
The states too are sidelined at least out until 2017.
And a key authority exercised by California to clean up cars is in the balance.
Time and again, the Clean Air Act has come to the rescue, moving in lock step with science.
Take sooty pollution, for example.
The EPA has acted to tighten standards when medical science demonstrated that lung disease and even death were being caused by smaller pollution particles.
Businesses say they are concerned about conflicting standards.
That’s easily resolved by directing the EPA to use only those tools specified by Congress for cutting climate pollution.
The Clean Air Act is set up perfectly to work with this kind of directive.
Already under the Act, certain kinds of pollutants are identified to be regulated through market mechanisms like trading, while others are handled through technology mandates.
The EPA is authorized, and in most instances required, under the Act, regularly to review the standards and update them.
In this way the EPA tightens standards to keep pace with science, but the more rigorous standard is a follow on to, not in conflict with, earlier directives.
Over the last decade, the states have led the way in devising and implementing strategies to cut greenhouse gases.
Their initiatives have worked well in containing pollution and raising revenues to support new clean energy projects that have grown local economies.
In the climate bills, these efforts are stopped by Congress.
They should not be.
Even in these bills, Congress recognizes that state and federal action can co-exist.
Case in point: New federal requirements for the use of renewable energy are called for in the climate legislation — as a complement to state action, not a replacement.
The states are not preempted on renewables and should not be on climate either.
Some Senators also want to strip California of its authority under the Clean Air Act to order cuts in climate pollution caused by cars.
This threatens a proven and vital instrument of environmental progress.
Vehicle by vehicle, the auto fleet today is remarkably cleaner than ever before.
Advances in electric and alternate fuel technology promise even more gains.
But the truth is that California has always pushed the progress toward a cleaner fleet.
The feds have followed.
Climate pollution proves the point: the federal government is acting only now, trailing California by nearly a decade.
Bottom line: cars would be dirtier and more inefficient today without California’s leadership, and that’s what we are in store for in the future if these provisions succeed.
It is important to remember that the pending climate bills represent only a very modest step forward in taking on the climate problem.
At 17 percent by 2020, the emission reductions are small compared to the cuts called for by scientists to stabilize the climate, and even then, the generous opportunity provided in the bills to count forest and farmland conservation against pollution reduction requirements means that pollution may be offset rather than actually cut.
Attempting these far reaching rollbacks of long-standing and proven environmental policy is a particularly bad idea in the context of climate change.
We know climate change presents greater challenges than any environmental problem confronted to date, imperiling the nation’s security and economy as well as public health.
To meet this challenge we should be acting now to reinforce and extend environmental policy tools, not take them away.”

“What the hell’s wrong with you?
This is the perfect storm to go all out for a robust clean energy jobs bill and you are sitting on your hands.
Are you insane?
We are destroying half our fishing industry and you are blowing it.
Everyone agrees, even the financial times!
See Joe Rohme’s fine discussion on this at http://climateprogress.org/ 2010/ 05/ 04/ obama-speech-bp-oil-disaster-clean-energy-climate-bill/
Also — although please forgive me for dumping on our favorite energy source, coal?!
— is there some problem with my mind?
Was I actually reading a clean energy and climate change bill when, all of a sudden, I came across wording that seemed to celebrate coal, commit to coal, commit to protect coal, commit to subsidize the coal industry, and practically act as though carbon sequestration and storage is a likely thing?
Atmospheric CO2 is accelerating upward from decade to decade.
In the past ten years, the average annual rate of increase was 1.91 parts per million (ppm).
This rate of increase is more than double what it was during the first ten years of CO2 instrument measurements at the Mauna Loa Observatory.
With the melting of the Arctic and Antarctic ice caps and 24% per quarter-year increases in China’s green house gas emissions there may only be Plan B dealing with accelerating environmental crisis as a war of positive disruption of business as usual outlined in Lester R. Brown’s books of the same in the latest version 4.0.
Nuclear energy is the dirtiest and the most $$ if you count the nuclear waste disposal cost and the health risk to the consumers from the associated high voltage lines.
This component of the cost, and the associated risks unloaded directly on the future energy consumers, are not part of the report and the topics are understated in the mainstream media.
The radioactive leaks are not publicized.
Not many people know there are “permitted” leaks and once the leak exceeds the “permitted” level it is often covered up.
The “permitted” radiation AND electro-magnetic levels already are well above European norms.
The right-of-way for the voltage generation is zoned with no regards to the consumers’ safety.
Everybody: Do research about your own neighborhood, you will find many nasty things.
And how will they enhance the “regulatory oversight” when the regulators are paid well less then they can get from power plants, who are rich with consumers’ money and our also paid by us tax guaranteed ????
wake-up here.
They cannot even make the border secure, and try to appear to be “tough” by busting successful union workers for papers.
How can they “secure” the power plants in residential proximity from an attack?
I read “TITLE II – GLOBAL WARMING POLLUTION REDUCTION” (starts on page 6) as clarifying and amplifying the EPA Administrator’s regulatory role under the CAA with respect to greenhouse gasses.
“Part A – Global Wanning Pollution Reduction Goals and Targets.
Sections 701-705.
States that the goals of Title VII and Title VIII are to reduce economy-wide global warming pollution to 95.25 percent of2005 levels by 2013,83 percent by 2020,58 percent by 2030, and 17 percent by 2050.
Includes a scientific review and program recommendations based on analysis of the latest scientific information.”
Actually, there was an “unmistakable message from above”, namely the “extreme precipitation event” that devastated Tennessee.
I talked to someone in Nashville who told me it was like Katrina, the entire downtown was under water — and he was astonished and appalled at the lack of national media coverage.
I know this site has been an exception and has reported on the flooding and the link to AGW.
But most people in the USA have little idea of what happened and NO idea of how it fits into the pattern of increasingly frequent and extreme “precipitation events”.
What I find especially amusing are the videos by Southerners who complain about a lack of coverage while displaying numerous press photographs of the flood.
Doh!
I have a friend in Nashville too, and he said the flood damage has been mostly overstated for political reasons, especially in the context of another tea-bagger canard – that the Obama administration failed to respond quickly.
[JR: Essentially no coverage of the link to climate change.

Federal action on climate change?
Maybe in 2008.
A very positive story on possible US action on climate change.
Two potential presidential candidates for the elections of 2008 have visited Alaska.
You can be as cynical as you like about the comments made by this pair, but after visiting Alaska and talking to both locals and scientists I don't think many people could remain unconvinced about the reality of the situation.
Two of the leading contenders in the next United States presidential election have delivered a wake-up call to the US over global warming - saying the evidence of climate change has become too stark to ignore and that human activity is a major cause of the problem.
Although both senators have talked of the need to tackle global warming, this week's clarion call was perhaps the clearest and most urgent.
It also raises the prospect that climate change and other environmental issues could be a factor in the 2008 presidential contest if Clinton and McCain contest the race.
Both are widely expected to do so.
It was not by chance that they chose Alaska as the stage from which to force global warming on to the American political agenda.
In many ways this separated US state is the frontline in the global warming debate.
Environmentalists say the signs of climate change are more obvious there than perhaps anywhere else in the US.
Dan Lashof, a scientist with the Natural Resources Defence Council, a respected Washington-based group, said: "People in Alaska are starting to freak out.
The retreat of the sea ice allows the oceans to pound the coast more and villages there are suffering from the effects of that erosion.
Campaigners say the position adopted by McCain and Clinton stands in stark contrast to that adopted by Bush, whose Administration has repeatedly questioned the evidence of global warming and the contribution of human activity to any shift.
Bush, who in 2001 refused to ratify the Kyoto Treaty on global warming just weeks after he took office, has repeatedly been accused of doing nothing to enforce tighter controls on emissions of carbon dioxide and other "greenhouse gases".
Meanwhile, the US National Academy of Sciences - and the scientific academies of the other G8 nations as well as Brazil, China and India - issued a statement this summer saying there was strong evidence that significant global warming was under way and that "it is likely that most of the warming in recent decades can be attributed to human activities".
It called on world leaders to recognise "that delayed action will increase the risk of adverse environmental effects and will likely incur a greater cost".
They also travelled to Seward to see shrinking glaciers in Kenai Fjords National Park.
"Climate change is different when you come here, because you see the faces of people experiencing it in Alaska," he said.
Collins, a Democrat, was even more convinced.
She said the evidence in Alaska represented the "canary in the mine shaft of global warming crying out to us to pay attention to the impact".
A spokesman for Senator Lisa Murkowski said she had been misrepresented in reports that said she doubted the evidence of global warming.
Elliot Bundy said: "Where there is a difference of opinion is regarding the extent of global warming and of the methods that need to be taken to deal with it.
"
Despite their relative scarcity, the so-called greenhouse gases play an important role in the regulation of the Earth's energy balance .
Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere trap infrared heat energy trying to escape back to space.
In doing so they raise the temperature of the lower atmosphere and the Earth's surface in contact with it.
This warming process is called the natural greenhouse effect , but during the last 200 years, mankind's pollution of the atmosphere with extra greenhouse gases has enhanced this natural greenhouse effect that may be contributing to global warming .
Greenhouse gases include any gas in the atmosphere that is capable, as a result of its particular molecular structure, of absorbing infrared radiation or heat.
They are called greenhouse gases because they behave like glass in a greenhouse gas, allowing sunlight to pass through but trapping the heat formed and preventing it from escaping, thereby causing a rise in temperature.
Natural greenhouse gases include water vapour or moisture, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and even ozone, which is more commonly associated with the ozone layer and ultraviolet radiation.
The amounts of all these gases in the atmosphere are now being increased as a result of man-made processes, such as fossil fuel burning and deforestation.
The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide, for example, has increased by 30% since the 18th century, whilst levels of methane have more than doubled.
Water vapour, whilst not directly released by man-made processes in substantial quantities, may be increasing as a result of climate feedback effects.
In addition to the man-made increase of naturally occurring greenhouse gases, mankind has released some completely new chemicals into the atmosphere, including the CFCs or chlorofluorocarbons.
Although these have now been banned in an attempt to save the ozone layer, they will remain in the atmosphere for at least another 50 years.
Although their abundance in the atmosphere is very low, molecule for molecule they can be thousands of times better at absorbing heat than carbon dioxide, and consequently contribute significantly to the enhanced greenhouse effect .
Furthermore, their replacements, the HCFCs (hydrochlorofluorocarbons) and HFCs (hydrofluorocarbons), whilst being relatively harmless to the ozone layer, are equally potent greenhouse gases, and at present their phase-out dates are not due for another 20 to 30 years.
“Climate change scandal” – the headlines proclaim.
In fact, the scandal is that the firm and increasing evidence of the danger of climate change is being ignored by large sections of the media.
It instead publishes stories implying the whole thing is a hoax.
The media climate has altered over the past couple of months such that The Express is now happy to publish “ Global warming: what a climate con .”
First was ‘Climategate’.
In autumn 2009, emails from the University of East Anglia’s Climatic Research Unit were illegally hacked and were published, just before the Copenhagen negotiations, resulting in a high-profile media storm.
A detailed briefing on this affair can be found at http://climatesafety.org/climategate-a-briefer/ - the most telling point being that “Not one piece of evidence or data has been altered or found to be wrong as a result.”
The Institute of Physics – whose statements about UEA’s “worrying scientific integrity” were jumped on by media sceptics to negate the whole phenomenon of climate change– have recently issued a clarification saying that, “the climate is changing, and we need to do something now to mitigate that change” while their submission, it has been revealed , is likely to have been influenced by an energy consultant.
‘Glaciergate’ encouraged the search for further ‘errors’ in the IPCC report.
Jonathan Leake at the Sunday Times has been particularly keen , announcing ‘Amazongate’.
The prediction that global warming might wipe out 40% of the Amazon rainforest was dismissed as an “unsubstantiated claim”.
This story was sourced from a climate denial blogger .
In fact, as BBC coverage on 30 January makes clear, there is peer-reviewed research predicting this impact.
The error in the report was that the reference given was a WWF report rather than primary research.
The article was the subject of a PCC complaint, which in June 2010 was upheld and The Sunday Times was forced to retract the article and issue an apology .
This was followed by ‘ Africagate ’ - attempts to smear as unreliable the discussion in the report of possible impacts of climate change on African agriculture - and ‘Seagate’ - an incorrect figure which had been provided by a Dutch government agency for the proportion of the Netherlands below sea level.
See discussion at http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2010/02/ipcc-errors-facts-and-spin/#more-2832 .
Another Times article on 14 February, World may not be warming, say scientists , cites work by Anthony Watts, a climate sceptic, on the siting of temperature stations, alleging that some produce poor quality data.
However, when the actual data is analysed, the poor quality stations are found to underestimate , not overestimate, any warming trend.
Back at The Times on 15 February, UN must investigate warming ‘bias’, says former climate chief “Professor Watson, currently chief scientific adviser to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, said that if the errors had just been innocent mistakes, as has been claimed by the current chairman, Rajendra Pachauri, some would probably have understated the impact of climate change.” In contrast, Deltoid blog reports that Robert Watson later said “The article distorted my statements - I was interviewed for an hour and it was obvious that the reporter wanted me to say that the authors were biased - I said I did not believe that.”
It has recently been revealed that Koch Industries, a little-known, privately owned US oil company, paid nearly US$50 million to climate denial groups and individuals between 1997 and 2008.
In a similar period Exxon Mobil paid out around $17 to $23 million.
Closer to home, it has been suggested that Shell's funding of an exhibition at the Science Museum may be linked to the museum stepping back from its earlier strong stance on climate change.
Those who actively promote climate scepticism are well networked , and have been termed 'deniers' rather than sceptics because many show scant regard for the facts , while seizing avidly on any error in the work of climate scientists.
This article discusses the psychology of climate change denial.
To gain an understanding of the level of scientific consensus on climate change, a recent study examined every article on climate change published in peer-reviewed scientific journals over a 10-year period.
Of the 928 articles on climate change the authors found, not one of them disagreed with the consensus position that climate change is happening or is human-induced.
These findings contrast dramatically with the popular media's reporting on climate change .
One recent study analyzed coverage of climate change in four influential American newspapers (New York Times, Washington Post, LA Times, and Wall Street Journal) over a 14-year period.
It found that more than half of the articles discussing climate change gave equal weight to the scientifically discredited views of the skeptics.
The big debate over climate legislation seems to be boiling down not to polar bears, ice sheets or light-switch taxes, but simply to jobs.
The pro (anti)-climate legislation forces argue that climate legislation will create (destroy) millions of jobs.
Both sides are wrong as climate legislation, and any environmental policy (past or future) will have limited macroeconomic impact over the long term.
Whether you support or oppose climate legislation should depend on how you feel about its real impacts (impacts on the environment and changes in the industrial sector of the U.S.) and your rate of time preference: if you use a high (low) discount rate then the future does not matter much and you oppose (are in favor of) climate legislation.
The last paragraph is in reference to the impact of the discount rate on the net benefits of climate change policy.
During the great productivity slowdown of the 1970s and early 80s, environmental regulation was blamed for a trim of about 0.2% off GDP growth rates (i.e., GDP grew by 2% instead of 2.2%).
We haven't heard much about macro impacts of the Clean Air and Water Acts since that time suggesting to me that the impact has been 0% (otherwise, some enterprising environmental regulation hater would have estimated a positive effect and published it -- have I missed something?).
It seems like business firms figure out how to deal with things and it becomes business as usual.
otherwise, some enterprising environmental regulation hater would have estimated a positive effect and published it
a good point.
though discount rate is not quite right, but more rate of return.
As Roger Noll used to argue in the class I TA'ed, rate of return has lots of other variables in there that matter, including uncertainty, both about the costs of environmental damages, but also the costs of mitigation.
Uncertainties that will lessen over time.
These uncertainties suggest a higher rate of return with which you use to discount the benefits of the policy.
#2: Good point, an objective researcher could certainly undertake estimating the costs of environmental regulation during the 1990s.
But the canary in the coal mine is that even the anti-environmental regulation crowd didn't work on the topic (as far as I can tell).
My hunch is that folks tried, couldn't find any big results and went on to work on bigger issues (at least in terms of publication success).
I find the whole jobs discussion quite bizarre - most seem to regard them as exogenous manna from heaven (or from Washington).
It's a feedback loop, for dog's sake!
Even if the macroeconomic effects of climate policy are noticeable, labor-leisure tradeoffs and other compensating factors are going to make the employment effects small in the long run.
Unless you botch your implementation in implausible ways, the transient effects will be hard to separate from noise.
The real question is, as you say, the intertemporal tradeoff of a little disturbance now vs. a possible big one in the future.

blog). That is a very nice service to the profession.
jobs .” The point of the piece is to argue against the cap-and-trade regulatory scheme of the energy bill currently being debated in Congress.
I find the Congresswoman’s argument to be either factually incorrect or missing a couple of points on the economics.
In the paragraphs below I provide individual comments but one striking thing about the entire piece is the lack of two words: climate change.
The whole purpose of implementing a cap-and-trade regulatory scheme is to address the biggest environmental challenge facing the
and the rest of world.
Any discussion of the costs of cap-and-trade should be contrasted with the benefits of cap-and-trade in order to get a complete picture of the policy.
Most economic analyses suggest that getting busy about climate is a fairly good idea.
Me: Most of the permits will likely be given away to producers initially.
Over time the percentage of permits sold to producers should increase.
Either way, energy prices will rise due to the increased scarcity of energy.
But, that is the point of cap-and-trade.
As energy prices rise, energy consumers will use less energy and greenhouse gas production will fall, mitigating the climate change problem.
Foxx: In my opinion, the real truth behind this so-called energy plan is that will (1)* jack up the cost of energy, (2) kill jobs, and (3) lead to more government intrusion in our lives.
(4) I think this cap and trade policy is really just an $846 billion national energy tax that will hit nearly every American family.
because energy demand will focus more on labor-intensive green energy jobs.
But as I’ve argued in the past at my blog (see, for example, Green jobs are expensive ), listeners should cover their ears during any debate over environmental policy that mentions the impact on jobs, either positive or negative.
In an economy as massive and diversified as the
’s, environmental policy, even one as pervasive as economy-wide cap-and-trade will have little net impact on overall job growth.
(3) A little bit of government intrusion in our lives can be a good thing.
In introductory economics most professors teach a section on “market failure” during which we consider three or four situations where government intervention in a market economy corrects problems such as under-provision of public goods (e.g., national defense), negative externality (e.g., environmental damage) and market power (e.g., price fixing).
(4) In this sense a tax is a government policy that raises prices and discourages the activity being taxed.
Contrary to current political opinion, all taxes aren’t bad.
Taxes that discourage harmful activities like smoking and drinking alcohol to excess and business practices that create pollution are a good thing.
Taxes on work effort (income) are relatively bad (in terms of economic efficiency, however, some might support income taxation due to its ease of collection and equity considerations).
Regardless, government needs some revenue so it makes sense to increase taxes on bad things and reduce taxes on good things.
The permit auction feature of cap-and-trade would raise government revenue.
Foxx: (1) This new national energy tax will be paid by anyone who turns on a light switch or plugs in an appliance.
(2) While many of the important details of this national energy tax plan are still not publically known, studies have shown that the plan will cost every American household hundreds or even thousands of dollars a year in higher energy prices.
Me: (1) Right on; the new national energy tax might encourage energy conservation!
Increasing the cost of lighting your house or leaving your computer on will cause people to think more about when they do these things unnecessarily.
(2) The latest research by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) shows that the cost in 2020 will be about $175 per year per household.
This might actually sound low and you might wonder how a policy that costs less than a dollar a day would have an impact.
The cost is held low because some of the government revenue generated by a permit auction could be redistributed to consumers in the form of lower taxes or energy rebates.
The higher energy prices would encourage energy conservation and less pollution, the lower taxes and energy rebates would allow people to spend money on other things, mitigating the negative impact of higher energy prices.
Foxx: I am also disappointed in the fact that this proposed national energy tax hits the poor the hardest.
Experts agree that lower income individuals spend a greater share of their income on energy consumption.
So while every American will be paying more for energy, low income households already living on the edge of economic ruin will be hurt even more.
Me: The only way to get consumers to cut back on energy consumption that leads to harmful climate change is for energy prices to rise.
This is a good thing.
(Also, I think that then Senator Obama was exaggerating when he used the word “skyrocket”).
Foxx: I’m afraid that the impact of this national energy tax will not only be seen in home utility bills or at the pump.
Various estimates suggest that anywhere from 1.8 million to 7 million Americans could lose their jobs as a result of this plan.
During this severe economic downturn we cannot afford to sacrifice millions more American jobs.
economy will begin growing again.
Also, a loss of jobs due to environmental policy is highly unlikely.
The last time that environmental policy intruded in individual lives in such a massive way was during the 1970s.
Opponents of the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act argued that these policies would destroy jobs and this didn’t happen.
As I’ve said already, it is a good idea to ignore opponents of environmental policy who argue that it will destroy jobs (and, to be fair, cover your ears when proponents of environmental policy argue that it will create jobs).
Foxx: (1) The President is promoting the ‘green jobs’ that may be created by his proposal, but any new jobs created will fall far short of replacing the millions of jobs lost to what I find to be a reckless energy policy.
(2) We have no greater example of the devastation a national energy tax can have on an economy than in
Foxx: This national energy tax claims to be an environmentally friendly plan.
But I’m very concerned that it may force many employers to relocate manufacturing plants overseas to countries with far less stringent environmental regulations.
A national energy tax will essentially ship American manufacturing jobs overseas while also shipping industrial emissions to another part of the world.
to be a global leader in climate change policy.
If the rest of the world implements a carbon cap and joins the permit market set up by cap-and-trade in the U.S. and Europe then there is no place for U.S. manufacturing plants to relocate to.
Also, the argument that carbon leakage will result in fewer net
Foxx: We can promote clean air and clean water without destroying millions of jobs and shipping pollution overseas.
I am committed to solving our energy crisis.
By using American-made energy and technological innovation, and by harnessing all our energy resources, from clean nuclear and biofuels to hydropower and wind, we can find a better way to achieve energy independence that doesn’t destroy our economy and kill American jobs.
Me: There really isn’t a good way of promoting clean air and water without raising the prices of consumer products that cause air and water pollution (and climate change).
Nuclear, biofuels and wind energy production all cost more than coal and oil.
In order to harness these resources government must provide subsidies to reduce their cost of production.
Except perhaps psychologically, it doesn’t really matter whether consumers are hit with higher prices or higher taxes that fund the subsidy (note that an increased deficit leads to higher taxes imposed upon future generations), a cost is a cost.
If we are to address environmental problems we need to realize that clean air and water and climate change mitigation requires an unavoidable cost.
As we say in introductory economics: “there is no such thing as a free lunch.”
can address the serious challenge of climate change.
A cap-and-trade policy: (1) can be used to reduce greenhouse gases by legally capping their emissions, (2) can achieve emissions reductions at a lower cost than government mandates (e.g., renewable portfolio standards) by allowing business firms to cut back pollution in ways that they see fit and by allowing trading of permits, (3) encourages technological innovation and switching to clean energy such as wind and solar with price incentives and (4) is politically feasible relative to other policies favored by economists (i.e., a carbon tax).

Each month NOAA’s National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) releases two assessments, one national and one global, of the previous month’s climate.
These reports include information on the temperature and precipitation levels experienced nationally and globally, providing useful information about these important climate variables in historical perspective.
The reports also chronicle any significant weather and climate-related events that occurred during the month.
This trusted source of information is used globally by industry and business, government agencies, academia, and members of the public to help inform decision making.
The global report is a monthly snapshot of the climate system around the globe that informs the public of the current state of the global climate and helps planners, academics and sector users factor the climate’s current state and recent trends into their decision making.
The report details the average global land temperature, the average global ocean temperature, and the combined average of the two.
Instead of using raw temperatures, the report presents temperature anomalies, which means the difference from average temperatures for any given area over a period of time.
Using anomalies allows for a more accurate understanding of temperature trends over space and time, even with some fluctuations in data availability (see additional information below).
According to Beijing Climate Center, Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, and Jilin experienced their warmest June since records began in 1951.
Meanwhile, Guizhou had its coolest June on record.
Each of the 10 warmest average global temperatures recorded since 1880 have occurred in the last fifteen years.
The warmest year-to-date on record, through June, was 1998, and 2010 is warmer so far (note: although 1998 was the warmest year through June, a late-year warm surge in 2005 made that year the warmest total year).
Analysis by the National Climatic Data Center reveals that June of 2010 was the warmest global average for that month on record, and is also the warmest year-to-date from January to June.
This graph plots the year-to-date average global land and ocean temperature.
The 2010 value, complete only through June, is shown in red at the end of the animation.
NOAA's NCDC is the world's largest active archive of weather data.
It houses data archives dating back to 1880 from all over the world.
Each month, countries from all over the world send their land-based meteorological surface observations, meaning temperature and precipitation measurements, to NCDC to be added to the global record.
This information is sent through the World Meteorological Organization's (WMO) Global Telecommunication System (GTS)—a coordinated system for the rapid collection, exchange and distribution of observation data from more than 200 countries around the world.
The data are sent in a format called "CLIMAT messages" (pronounced "cleem-mat"), which are a summary of monthly weather data for a specific station.
The CLIMAT message contains information of average pressure at station level, average air temperature, maximum air temperature, minimum air temperature, average vapor pressure, total precipitation, and total sunshine for a particular month.
These messages are typically sent to NCDC by the 8th of every month.
NCDC uses the data to produce numerous climate publications, such as the monthly global state of the climate report.
In the image, the red dots on the animation above show how a typical month's worth of data arrives at NCDC, in a day-by-day, country-by-country fashion.
Please refer to the WMO for detailed information about CLIMAT messages or the GTS .
In a patch of woodland on the outskirts of Hastings, on the English south coast, a group of men huddle around a brick laboratory as smoke curls from its two chimneys.
The men are trying, with some chemical trickery, to bring a lucrative piece of South America to Sussex, to spark what they believe could be a £1bn industry in Britain.
Craig Sams, a millionaire chocolate maker, and Dan Morrell, a former music promoter and entrepreneur, are producing charcoal, and their aim is to get rich by selling it to tackle global warming.
Together Sams and Morrell make Carbon Gold , a company they have set up to exploit the growing interest in green solutions to climate change.
The brick laboratory is, they claim, Britain's first dedicated facility to produce biochar , which is what you call charcoal when you are selling it as a solution to global warming.
Their idea is a low-tech take on the futuristic concept of carbon capture and storage.
Carbon, in the form of wood from trees and agricultural waste, can be turned to charcoal and buried in the ground, so storing it away from the atmosphere.
If enough carbon can be buried in this way, then it could bolster so-far feeble global attempts to address climate change through cuts greenhouse gas emissions.
But it also has some high profile critics.
Writing in this newspaper in March , George Monbiot said: "The idea that biochar is a universal solution that can be safely deployed on a vast scale is as misguided as Mao Zedong's Great Leap Backwards.
" He added: "According to the magical thinkers who promote it, the new miracle stops climate breakdown, replaces gas and petroleum, improves the fertility of the soil, reduces deforestation, cuts labour, creates employment, prevents respiratory disease and ensures that when you drop your toast it always lands butter side up.
"
Good idea or bad, if Sams and Morrell have their way, green consumers who want to offset the damaging emissions from their flights or cars will soon be able to pay Carbon Gold to make biochar on their behalf.
Within weeks, the company expects to be approved by the offset industry's unofficial watchdog.
Bigger markets could follow: the firm is among those lobbying for biochar credits to be included in the UN's clean development mechanism - a global carbon trading scheme used by countries such as Britain to meet ambitious carbon targets.
A decision could be made as soon as December, at key climate talks in Copenhagen.
Morrell, who founded Future Forests, which later became the Carbon Neutral Company, said: "Biochar is the only technology that enables us to take invisible carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, transform it into black lumps of pure carbon and, by ploughing it into the soil, prevent it from going back into the atmosphere.
"
He added: "We don't want to clear-cut woodland and turn it to dust.
That's slightly alarmist.
We're not saying this is the answer to global warming, but I don't see why it can't be one of a suite of solutions.
"
Biochar is not emissions free - the rest of the carbon from the wood goes up in smoke, but Morrell says it is better for the climate than burning or leaving it to rot, which can produce methane.
He says their primary targets are large agricultural sites such as vineyards and olive producers, which have large amounts of waste cuttings.
Morrell's answer to the critics of biochar is a rule book produced by the company that is currently being considered by the Voluntary Carbon Standard, which regulates carbon offsets.
Morrell says it includes safeguards to make sure wood and other feedstocks used are sustainable, as well as to preserve biodiversity and to give work to local people.
"Of course it will be easier to just clear cut forest, but we think we can set the bar high enough to keep those people out.
"
Mike Childs, climate campaigner with Friends of the Earth, said: "The problems with biochar are largely the same as biofuel.
If you manage it properly then making limited amounts is OK, sensible and useful.
But there is massive pressure on forests for land and protecting ecosystems, and the potential to produce lots [of biochar] comes up against those pressures.
In the short term it is not the answer to climate change.
"
Still worried about the volatiles - if any of the carbon escapes as volatile compounds in the atmosphere I think it is a dead cert that they will be a worse greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.
Methane, for instance, is much worse than dear old CO2.
'Biochar is a way for carbon to be drawn from the atmosphere and is a solution to reducing the global impact of farming (and in reducing the impact from all agricultural waste).
Since biochar can sequester carbon in the soil for hundreds to thousands of years, it has received considerable interest as a potential tool to slow global warming.
The burning and natural decomposition of trees and agricultural matter contributes a large amount of CO2 released to the atmosphere.
Biochar can store this carbon in the ground, potentially making a significant reduction in atmospheric GHG levels; at the same time its presence in the earth can improve water quality, increase soil fertility, raise agricultural productivity and reduce pressure on old growth forests.
'
avensis... becuase that isn't the process, this is using waste wood that woudl just rot away and put GHG into the atmosphere, i side product of forests and farming the forests..
This seems to sum up quite beautifully the activities of many currently involved in promulgating the "science is settled mantra" be they scientists, politicians or wannabe 21st century charcoal burners (bearing in mind of course that the original charcoal burners were responsible for some fairly significant deforestation)
Furthermore, the pyrolysis process whilst not terribly sophisticated is nevertheless sensitive to feedstock - which for the most part does not need to be wood.
If these chaps want to make money, the sensible thing would be to have bio-char included in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme and using farm residues (e.g.
straw). Thus addressing many of the issues Monbiot raised.
In the final analysis, anybody thinks that bio-char is a silver bullet is a fool.
It is a tool (others include, energy efficiency & reduction, RES and if it happens carbon capture and storage).
It needs to be deployed with the others.
Using EU crop residues could sequester about 10% of current EU emissions.
As these decline this proportion would rise.
This is not a silver bullet scenario, but it could help.
The charring of agricultural residues makes enormous sense, especially if, as seems likely, biochar can help maintain soil fertility due to its ability to improve the characteristics of soil generally known as "structure" i.e.
the ability to retain moisture, the provision of a microbiologically-friendly environment and increased oxygenation.
These factors are particularly important in tropical soils where the climate is harsh on cultivated land.
Much tropical deforestation is the result of agricultural land becoming exhausted so in summary we have:
However, the moment deforestation occurs to produce biochar, the advantages are lost, particularly since a lot of carbon is sequestered in forest soils.
all options, including nuclear power, are needed to combat climate change; and
nuclear power’s economics matter little because governments must use it anyway to protect the climate.
If Amory Lovins were Barack Obama’s Secretary of Energy, we’d be more than halfway home to solving the climate crisis.
Instead, we have Steven Chu’s nuclear boondoggle .
(In Chu’s defense, though, I have to say that the political “thinkers” in the White House are pushing nukes too because they think they’ll “win votes.”)
Another excellent bet is on track further south in California.
This “EERE Network News” article looks at a 750 MW proposal that would put 42,000 dish/Stirling systems, called SunCatchers, on 10 square miles of land in the desert.
SunCatchers are also a CSP technology.
Tessera Solar , the developer, has ambitious plans for California and elsewhere in the world.
It’s 64 years later and there’s a lot riding now on the proceedings in Copenhagen.
I would hope there’ll be one or two good profiles of the 15th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change at some point down the line.
But right now, we just have to be in the moment and speculate that the (largely) very good folks on the job are sensitive to the critical importance of their work and have the poise, intelligence, good will and commitment to bring it all off.
As of yesterday, here is a Reuters “Factbox” on the score.
Issues up in the air include the targets for emission reductions; whether or not the Kyoto Protocol will continue or be replaced by an entirely new pact; to what extent developing nations will be held to account for emissions; how to finance mitigation, adaptation, and “capacity building” and how much will be available, and when; and what shape an expanded role for the “carbon” markets will have.
Financing the prevention of deforestation and forest degradation is definitely going forward - a quantum leap from Kyoto - but how exactly that’s going to look is up in the air.
It’s been understood for a month, for many of these issues, that no final decisions will be taken in Copenhagen.
(See Copenhagen or Bust?
)
It appears that things are a little disarrayed, but there are also indications that frantic but focused negotiations behind the scenes are producing positive results.
The conference, as you know, is scheduled to be wrapped up in three days with over 100 world leaders putting their imprimatur on an agreement.
Angela Merkel admitted her nervousness about hitting the mark by Friday.
Reuters further reports Ministers try to break deadlock at climate talks .
Some of the trouble lies in “…disputes over the level of emissions cuts by rich countries and a long-term global target to curb a rise in global temperatures which could trigger rising sea levels, floods and drought.” Yvo de Boer said: “We have seen significant progress in a number of areas but we haven’t seen enough of it…we are in a very important phase.”
Secretary Clinton makes, to me, a further critically important point in her op-ed.
Switching over to clean tech is the most economic and environmentally sound approach to life going forward on this planet.
Why some of the leading developing nations are so adamant - along with the fossil fuel special interests, plus much of Big Ag and Big Power - about the “freedom” to continue their development along the lines that for two centuries has generated massive pollution with a concomitant impact on health , crushing costs, geopolitical instability and the destruction of the economies and cultures of many, many places around the world - see the natural resource curse , for instance - is beyond me.
Clinton says: “The simple fact is that nearly all of the growth in emissions in the next 20 years will come from the developing world.
Without their participation and commitment, a solution is impossible.
Some are concerned that a strong agreement on climate change will undermine the efforts of developing nations to build their economies, but the opposite is true.
This is an opportunity to drive investment and job creation around the world, while bringing energy services to hundreds of millions of the world’s poor.”
Gibbs also released a statement yesterday on further progress on the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate (MEF) Global Partnership.
In Copenhagen, Energy Sec.
Steven Chu announced the MEF “Technology Action Plans” along with the US’s Climate REDI program.
(See yesterday’s post below.
) I continue to be mightily impressed by how focused and hard-charging the Obama Administration is being on climate and energy.
The “Financial Times” front page this morning declared China signals climate funds shift .
Apparently, the PRC “… abandoned its demand for funding from the developed world to combat climate change…” The lead American negotiator, Todd Stern, had put the idea of US support for substantially underwriting China’s mitigation efforts to rest last week.
In this “NY Times” article , he’s quoted: “We absolutely recognize our historic role in putting emissions in the atmosphere up there that are there now, but the sense of guilt or culpability or reparations, I just categorically reject that.” I guess the Chinese heard that.
US Energy Secretary Steven Chu announced a major effort to deploy clean tech in developing nations.
The “Washington Post” reports on this here .
The Renewables and Efficiency Deployment Initiative (Climate REDI) will support, as one important example, affordable solar home systems and LED lanterns.
(I’ve written about the importance of getting to a better way of cooking and providing heat and light in developing nations a number of times, not least because of the incredible health impacts of burning biomass.
) There’s more on this from DOE here .
Those are cooling towers.
If power plants don’t use cooling towers, they will likely draw water from a local river and circulate the cool water through the plant and dump the hot water back into the river causing considerable thermal pollution - destroying fish and other aquatic life.
Senators Bernie Sanders and Jeff Merkley have introduced the Thermal Energy Efficiency Act.
This would provide considerable funding for combined heat and power, waste energy recovery, and district energy projects.
Sanders’s press release notes “…combined heat and power represents roughly 9 percent of our existing electric power capacity today, but if we moved to 20 percent by 2030, we could avoid 60 percent of the projected growth in carbon dioxide emissions in this country.”
An article in Grist by Dave Roberts discusses some of the ins and outs, including the fact that “…a) this is an enormous opportunity to cost-effectively reduce climate pollution, and b) there’s enormous, pent-up demand for coordinated resources and assistance.”
Frankly, I wish that Steven Chu was hammering heat recovery.
White roofs are a terrific concept, and practical, to be sure, but when you are talking about the massive energy loss and thermal pollution involved with power plants, then it is indeed criminal to not mandate heat recovery.
United States and China to Cooperate on Climate Change and Energy is the word from the excellent weekly, “EERE Network News,” put out by DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) .
As I noted recently here , DOE Secretary Steven Chu was in China recently and the pressure is building on the Chinese to play ball in Copenhagen.
The tea leaves are revealing auspicious things.
According to the item from EERE, “The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) elevates climate change in the relationship between the two countries, committing them both to reaching a successful international agreement that addresses the problem.”
The State Department has had a key role in advancing this dialogue.
In the transcript of the remarks from the signing ceremony, Secretary Clinton said that the MOU “… provides our countries with direction as we work together to support international climate negotiations and accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy.” State Councilor Dai Bingguo, a considerable heavyweight in the top PRC leadership, said “I think our two countries have an important contribution to make to the global efforts to tackle climate change, to ensure energy security, to protect the environment and the only planet we have.”
The US and China established a mechanism for “Climate Change Policy Dialogue and Cooperation” which will “promote (i) discussion and exchange of views on domestic strategies and policies for addressing climate change; (ii) practical solutions for promoting the transition to low-carbon economies; (iii) successful international negotiations on climate change; (iv) joint research, development, deployment, and transfer, as mutually agreed, of climate-friendly technologies; (v) cooperation on specific projects; (vi) adaptation to climate change; (vii) capacity building and the raising of public awareness; and (viii) pragmatic cooperation on climate change between cities, universities, provinces and states of the two countries.”
For another view of the US-China relationship on climate change and energy, see the video of John Kerry’s appearance at the National Press Club earlier this week.
Kerry, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is articulate about the progress that has been made by China.
He is nearly unfailingly optimistic about an agreement in Copenhagen and a vigorous climate change and clean energy package coming from the Congress.
Some of the Q&A near the end is particularly interesting, and Kerry gives a wonderful pitch for the “no-regrets” philosophy of climate change.
(From 1:00:30 of the video to the end.
)
US Commerce Secretary Gary Locke and Energy Secretary Steven Chu were in China recently and climate change was at the top of the agenda.
Both are Chinese Americans.
The ostensible purpose of the two secretaries’ visit was to advance work on clean tech.
Much of the context of these efforts, however, are the looming climate crisis and the international talks on confronting it.
Locke said, in remarks in Beijing , “Widespread deployment of energy efficiency and clean energy technologies is also the only way our economies can continue to grow while preventing the catastrophic effects of climate change.
And as the two biggest emitters of carbon dioxide, the United States and China have a special responsibility to take action.” The key words here are “responsibility” and “action.” Locke drove the point further: “We all share the same atmosphere and if we do not act, we’ll all suffer from the coastal flooding, unpredictable weather, and agricultural damage that is undoubtedly in store if we don’t change the way we use energy.
As inhabitants of this planet, we will rise or fall together.”
Chu toured “America House,” a zero-energy green building demonstration project, and said, as reported by DOE here , “Making buildings more efficient represents one of the greatest, and most immediate opportunities we have to create jobs, save money, save energy and reduce carbon pollution.” Chu also took a hard line on China’s emissions.
Chu told the Chinese that “China’s greenhouse-gas emissions growth is on course to wipe out gains from Western conservation efforts unless the nation intensifies clean-up efforts,” according to the “WSJ” here .
EU ups pressure on China to agree emissions cuts is the headline from EurActiv last week.
A high-level EU environmental delegation that included EU Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas and the Spanish and Swedish environment ministers visited China from July 11 through 14.
They called on all developing countries to curb their emissions by 15-30% from business-as-usual levels by 2020.
The EU ministers met with the head of China’s Climate Change and Coordinating Committee, Xie Zhenhua, and Environmental Protection Minister Zhou Shengxian.
China, India and the other rapidly industrializing countries must move toward the realization that they have a huge responsibility and, frankly, they have huge opportunities.
If they want to continue down the path of high-pollution, high-carbon, high-cost economies, then there will be consequences not only for the Earth’s climate system but for their economies as well.
Major Economies Forum (MEF) on Energy and Climate - After the second of four meetings scheduled to take place among the world’s major economies - all major contributors to global warming - the participants announced progress on finance.
The 2nd MEF meeting took place this week in Paris.
(See my notes from April on the first meeting.
) This article from AFP quotes French Ecology Minister Jean-Louis Borloo: “We made progress on a major subject, which is finance and financial architecture.
It’s not final, but one feels that there is a real consensus.” Todd Stern , America’s top climate diplomat, was also enthusiastic.
He said that there was interest in a “Green Fund” proposed by Mexico last year.
In this Reuters article , Stern says that on policy “The United States is proposing to make a seismic change.” Next stop for the MEF?

Nobel Laureate Symposium - In London, a meeting took place this week of Nobelists and top climate change experts.
The underlying theme was “the fierce urgency of now…” Participants included Dr. Rajendra Pachauri, head of the IPCC; Steven Chu, US Secretary of Energy; Wangari Maathai, founder of the Green Belt movement; and Lord Nicholas Stern, leader of the UK’s seminal “ Stern Review on the economics of climate change .” The release from the conference, hosted by Prince Charles and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said “…60 leading scientists from various disciplines, among them more than 20 Nobel Laureates, will discuss the dimensions of the climate crisis and innovative strategies for solutions.” The Potsdam Institute said “Major items of the agenda will be measures to counter deforestation, the development and implementation of new technologies, the options to establish a low-carbon energy infrastructure, as well as the role of global and national economic and political frameworks.” Secretary Chu had an op-ed in the “Times of London” detailing many of the Obama administration’s new initiatives.
He wrote that “…Obama has a real and deep commitment to putting America on a sustainable energy path.
Energy is a signature issue of his Administration, and, with his leadership, we have a great moment of possibility for meeting our global economic, energy and climate challenges.”
World Business Summit on Climate Change - Meanwhile, the Copenhagen Climate Council hosted this congregation of business leaders and climate change nabobs earlier this week.
The UNSG, Ban Ki-moon, revved up the participants, urging them to action.
In his speech , he told them “With your support, and through your example, we must harness the necessary political will to seal the deal on an ambitious new climate agreement in December here in Copenhagen.” Other high-profile speakers included Al Gore, Rajendra Pachauri, and José Manuel Barroso, President of the European Commission, as well as Tim Flannery , Chairman, Copenhagen Climate Council.

TALLAHASSEE, FLA.—With the addition of a dozen hotels to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection’s (DEP) Green Lodging program, there are now 650 hotels in the program.
The 650th property to join is the Holiday Inn Hotel and Suites in Clearwater Beach.
“Florida’s Green Lodging Program encourages and enables vacationers to be environmentally conscious even while they are relaxing on a getaway,” said Deas Bohn, DEP director of sustainable initiatives.
“While Floridians are vacationing, they can also be conserving water and energy while protecting the state’s natural resources.” To become a designated member of the voluntary program, lodging facilities adopt cost-saving green practices that conserve energy, reduce water consumption, protect air quality and reduce waste.
The Florida Green Lodging Program includes facilities of all sizes, from local bed and breakfast inns to resorts with thousands of rooms.
All Florida State Park cabins have received Green Lodging designations.
Launched in 2004, the Florida Green Lodging Program establishes environmental guidelines for lodging facilities to conserve natural resources and prevent pollution.
“Florida Dept.
of Environmental Protection's Green Lodging Program just added its 650th hotel: the Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites in Clearwater.”
VINEYARD HAVEN, MASS.—Until this summer, the 16,000 gallons of groundwater that runs below the Mansion House Inn, Health Club & Spa was a nuisance.
Because the inn’s subbasement sits in the middle of the groundwater, the water constantly had to be pumped away to protect the structure.
Now, the water is an asset.
How so?
It stores energy not only from the sun above the inn but also energy pumped into it via a sophisticated geothermal heat pump system.
For Sherman and Susan Goldstein, the inn’s owners, realizing the water’s potential was like striking gold.
PORTLAND, MAINE—If imitation is the greatest form of flattery, Peter Cooke has good reason to be pleased with his work with Maine’s Department of Environmental Protection.
In creating their own state green lodging certification programs, at least seven states and two cities have borrowed from the Maine Green Lodging Certification Program that Cooke runs.
What makes Maine’s program attractive is its simplicity—it is points based—and the fact that so much research has gone into developing the criteria for inclusion.
Maine is also the only state green lodging certification program in the United States to actually measure yearly savings and reductions in environmental impact connected to program participation.
Some parts of the blogosphere, headed up by CEI (“ CO2: They call it pollution, we call it life!
“), are all a-twitter over an apparently “suppressed” document that supposedly undermines the EPA Endangerment finding about human emissions of carbon dioxide and a basket of other greenhouse gases.
Well a draft of this “suppressed” document has been released and we can now all read this allegedly devastating critique of the EPA science.
Let’s take a look…
First off the authors of the submission; Alan Carlin is an economist and John Davidson is an ex-member of the Carter administration Council of Environmental Quality.
Neither are climate scientists.
That’s not necessarily a problem – perhaps they have mastered multiple fields?
– but it is likely an indication that the analysis is not going to be very technical (and so it will prove).
Curiously, while the authors work for the NCEE (National Center for Environmental Economics), part of the EPA, they appear to have rather closely collaborated with one Ken Gregory (his inline comments appear at multiple points in the draft).
Ken Gregory if you don’t know is a leading light of the Friends of Science – a astroturf anti-climate science lobbying group based in Alberta.
Indeed, parts of the Carlin and Davidson report appear to be lifted directly from Ken’s rambling magnum opus on the FoS site.
However, despite this odd pedigree, the scientific points could still be valid.
Their main points are nicely summarised thus: a) the science is so rapidly evolving that IPCC (2007) and CCSP (2009) reports are already out of date, b) the globe is cooling!, c) the consensus on hurricane/global warming connections has moved from uncertain to ambiguous, d) Greenland is not losing mass, no sirree…, e) the recession will save us!, f) water vapour feedback is negative!, and g) Scafetta and West’s statistical fit of temperature to an obsolete solar forcing curve means that all other detection and attribution work is wrong.
From this “evidence”, they then claim that all variations in climate are internal variability, except for the warming trend which is caused by the sun, oh and by the way the globe is cooling.
One can see a number of basic flaws here; the complete lack of appreciation of the importance of natural variability on short time scales, the common but erroneous belief that any attribution of past climate change to solar or other forcing means that CO2 has no radiative effect, and a hopeless lack of familiarity of the basic science of detection and attribution.
But it gets worse, what solid peer reviewed science do they cite for support?
A heavily-criticised blog posting showing that there are bi-decadal periods in climate data and that this proves it was the sun wot done it .
The work of an award-winning astrologer (one Theodor Landscheidt , who also thought that the rise of Hitler and Stalin were due to cosmic cycles ), a classic Courtillot paper we’ve discussed before , the aforementioned FoS web page, another web page run by Doug Hoyt, a paper by Garth Paltridge reporting on artifacts in the NCEP reanalysis of water vapour that are in contradiction to every other reanalysis, direct observations and satellite data, a complete reprint of another un-peer reviewed paper by William Gray, a nonsense paper by Miskolczi etc.
etc. I’m not quite sure how this is supposed to compete with the four rounds of international scientific and governmental review of the IPCC or the rounds of review of the CCSP reports….
They don’t even notice the contradictions in their own cites.
For instance, they show a figure that demonstrates that galactic cosmic ray and solar trends are non-existent from 1957 on, and yet cheerfully quote Scafetta and West who claim that almost all of the recent trend is solar driven!
They claim that climate sensitivity is very small while failing to realise that this implies that solar variability can’t have any effect either.
They claim that GCM simulations produced trends over the twentieth century of 1.6 to 3.74ºC – which is simply (and bizarrely) wrong (though with all due respect, that one seems to come directly from Mr. Gregory). Even more curious, Carlin appears to be a big fan of geo-engineering , but how this squares with his apparent belief that we know nothing about what drives climate, is puzzling.
A sine qua non of geo-engineering is that we need models to be able to predict what is likely to happen, and if you think they are all wrong, how could you have any faith that you could effectively manage a geo-engineering approach?
‘c) the consensus on hurricane/global warming connections has moved from uncertain to ambiguous’
I’ve been monitoring “skeptic” websites and press commentary.
In the last few months there has been a lot more talk about climate change, all of it escalating in intensity as well as number of articles (non-scientific of course) and harping on a few points such as Ian Plimer’s book in Australia, the globe-is-cooling mantra etc.
It’s probably conservatives trying to seize the attack ground in view of a possible pending debate about climate change in Washington, but the chorus of denialist opinion is so coordinated and their “logic” so simple it is convincing many, even among educated people (science PhDs) who cannot be bothered to look deep into things but try to form an opinion based on a few journalistic pieces.
We should expect a very hard fight ahead.
[Response: Let me be clear that my interactions with EPA - over the endangerment review process, with air quality/climate connections - have been extremely positive.
I very much doubt this level of non-scholarship is typical of the EPA as a whole.
Like most big organizations, I'm pretty sure there is a wide range of competence.

[Response: What's your point?
He isn't a climate scientist, he's an expert in environmental economics.
How much Earth Science did you get in physics degree in the 1970s?
Even now?
One might have expected some basic statistics, but even that is not evident in the paper.

"EPA is relying most heavily on these synthesis reports because they... 3)have been reviewed and formally accepted by, commissioned by, or in some cases authored by, U.S. government agencies and individual government scientists and provide EPA with assurances that this material has been well vetted by both the climate change research community and by the U.S. government; and 4) in many cases, they reflect and convey the consensus conclusions of expert authors.
"
"In addition to its reliance on existing and primarily recent synthesis reports from the peer reviewed literature,it also underwent a technical review by12 federal climate change experts, internal EPA review, and interagency review.
"
First, after talking with Alan Carlin and the source I cited yesterday, I would advise playing the ball, not the man.
Although you may be certain he is wrong–it seems that way from this post–the man is painfully honest and seems to have a lot of integrity.
He’s also intelligent.
In my conversation with him yesterday I asked him point blank if he felt competent to analyse and form an opinion on climate change issues.
He said certainly with regards to the efficacy of general circulation models and climate modelling overall, and that much of the rest of the science was accessible.
If you believe him to be wrong, a snarky post like this one here is probably not going to contribute much to the conversation.
Eventually your ‘team’ will find out that this particular series of events is a microcosm of climate change issues overall.
Carlin (and I) don’t believe his opinion was suppressed, as the CEI wants to claim.
It’s worse.
His six years of research on climate issues was ignored by a bureaucracy that has absolutely no education on climate change simply because the policy was already decided, and no evidence was needed.
Your ‘team’s’ failure to engage with skeptics and your insistence that the issues are all settled is killing you in so many ways, that if I were truly a skeptic I would keep silent and watch you continue.
But I’m not.
I’m a ‘lukewarmer’ and as a journalist I’m trying to be fair to both sides.
I find it truly bizarre that you (or one of the skeptic blogs) has not yet realized that weblogs are the absolutely perfect mechanism for conducting a proper debate on an issue like climate change, and that you all prefer ragging on each other with posts like this one.
But you, like some of the skeptic blogs, seem to know what brings regular readers back, and it seems to be snark.
As for blogs being good for debate, my experience is the opposite.
The amount of regurgitated nonsense, logical fallacies, appalling personal comments and smears against the whole scientific community that pass for argument on WUWT and similar, simply preclude most reasonable conversations on the subject.
What is the point in trying to make a logical point if everything one says is immediately dismissed because you're part of a giant scientific fraud?
There is no learning process.
You can spend as much time as you like explaining the basis of the paleo-climate constraints on climate sensitivity, only to have the next comment claim that it's tiny based on an unpublished back-of-the-agenda calculation he read online.
The issue is that the science that is understood is uncomfortable for some people and unfortunately they're much more attached to their prejudices than they are to the scientific method.
- gavin]
By the way, Mr. Carlin’s previous papers seemed to have been about his concern that GHG reduction was not going to be fast or strong enough to handle the problem.
He was advocating geoengineering with Solar Radiation Management, something that would be a pretty tough sell politically.
I can see why EPA officials might have wanted to avoid the appearance of endorsement for re-engineering the planet’s atmosphere, regardless of the correctness of the position.
I have to applaud this much-more-direct-than-usual-rebuttal.
While it seems a good many climate scientists are privately scared spitless, few will speak directly about the state of the environment.
Worse, strong rebuttals of the nonsense that has slowed/prevented action for the last couple decades have been largely absent.
And using denialist code-words for mainstream climate scientists will do nothing to enhance your credibility ’round here.
In skimming through the draft, what I find most amusingly disturbing is in Section 3, where they claim that human welfare has increased over the 20th century.
We could have a long (and probably pointless) debate over just how that’s measured, but one of their claims is that “our general air quality has increased”, as “evidence” of which they present their Figure 3-3, showing a (slight!
) decline in ozone levels between 1980 and 2007.
If you are looking at the same report as me, it opens ‘We have become incresingly concerned that EPA and many other agencies and counties have paid too little attention to the science of global warming….’, later on, unusually for an academic paper, they pose the question what is science?‘, and give a nice Feynmann quote in part response.

How the … did that get in there?
Instant credibility destroyer.
“Nevertheless, several of the opinions and ideas proposed by this individual were submitted to those responsible for developing the proposed endangerment finding.
Additionally, his manager allowed his general views on the subject of climate change to be heard and considered inside and outside the EPA and presented at conferences and at an agency seminar.
The individual was also granted a request to join a committee that organizes an ongoing climate seminar series, open to both agency and outside experts, where he has been able to invite speakers with a full range of views on climate science.
The claims that his opinions were not considered or studied are entirely false.”
“Carlin is a senior operations research analyst who has worked in EPA’s economics office since 1983.
He has a doctorate in economics and a bachelor’s degree in physics.
He specializes in cost-benefit analysis and the economics of global climate change control, EPA said.
The co-author of the report, John Davidson, is an environmental scientist in the economics office who holds a doctorate in physics.
Davidson also joined the program in 1983.”
[Response: Why is this contrary?
I didn't discuss their education.
The issue is whether they have any expertise in climate science - perhaps you would care to show me any of their peer-reviewed papers in recognisable climate-related journals?
Cost-benefit analysis is not radiative transfer oddly enough.
- gavin]
Yes, but none of those people are competent in climate science.
There are a lot of people who think we never landed on the Moon, too.
There are even more who think the Earth is 6-10,000 years old.
Doesn’t mean they know what they’re talking about.
On the contrary, carbon dioxide makes crops and forests grow faster.
Satellite mapping shows the Earth has become about 6 percent greener overall in the past two decades, with forests expanding into arid regions.
The Amazon rain forest was the biggest gainer, with two tons of additional biomass per acre per year.
The world will laugh when we finally understand the pursuit of economic ruin in the name of saving the planet from carbon dioxide has been a terrible joke.
It is an unarguable fact that the portion of the Earth’s greenhouse gas envelope contributed by man is barely one-tenth of 1 percent of the total.
Do the numbers yourself.
Carbon dioxide is no more than 4 percent of the total atmosphere—with water vapor being more than 90 percent, followed by methane and sulfur and nitrous oxides.
Of that 4 percent, man contributes a little more than 3 percent.
Three percent of 4 percent is .12 percent, and for that we are sentencing people to numerous damaging economic impacts.
The effect of additional carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is limited because CO2 absorbs only certain wavelengths of radiant energy.
As the radiation in that particular wavelength band is used up, the amount left for absorption by more of the gas is reduced.
This is the case with the absorption of energy as more carbon dioxide is added to the atmosphere.
If greenhouse gases were responsible for global temperature increases in recent decades, atmospheric physics require that higher levels of our atmosphere would show greater warming than lower levels.
This did not happen during the 1978-1998 period of 0.3 degrees Celsius warming.
A full 900,000 years of ice core temperature records and carbon dioxide content records show CO2 increases follow increases in Earth’s temperature instead of leading them.
This makes sense because the oceans are the primary source of CO2, and they hold more CO2 when cool than when warm.
Warming causes the oceans to release more CO2.
“Do the numbers yourself.
Carbon dioxide is no more than 4 percent of the total atmosphere—with water vapor being more than 90 percent”
[Response: Sorry, I must have missed something... what new results?
If you want really new and interesting results, look at Bart's recent discussions about aerosols, or Ron talking about dust and hurricanes , but made-up energy transfer theories?
lame attempts to correlate solar to anything under the sun?
Please. - gavin]
Just an idle curious aside: why is the Chairman of the IPCC never pooh-poohed like other non-climate scientists that issue stuff are?
I think it’s more likely the EPA was trying to save the poor bloke’s reputation … or perhaps the EPA’s reputation.
It must be embarrassing all around to have someone so ignorant of climate science spewing such nonsense in public.
Rogers took the silliness in good humor, 'fessing that coal generates 70 percent of Duke's energy and his belief in global warming.
He said Duke has to keep customers' lights on while figuring out how to capture the carbon dioxide that coal plants belch and store it underground.
Dividing $150 billion by 1.7 million gives a green jobs cost estimate of $88,235 per job.
Frankly, I'd rather see the benefits of $150 billion in clean energy measured as the value of environmental improvement.
If we focus on the macroeconomic effects of government subsidized and mandated clean energy then green jobs are costs to society, not benefits, as they represent a more expensive way of producing goods and services.
The benefits of subsidies and mandates should be measured as the value of the (1) improved health, recreation and ecological benefits and (2) climate change mitigation benefits of clean energy.
Check out the new U.S. climate change report:
On June 16, the U.S. Global Change Research Program released the NOAA-led study, " Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States " - a state of knowledge report about the observed and projected consequences of climate change for our nation and people.
The document is an authoritative scientific report written in plain language, with the goal of better informing public and private decision making at all levels.
The Union of Concerned Scientists is engaging Pennsylvania scientists and economists to emphasize the importance of taking action to mitigate the worst effects of climate change in the Commonwealth, and to point up the opportunities it offers for the Commonwealth to become a leader in renewable energy technology.
Members of the Pennsylvania delegation represent key votes in the climate debate.
The Pennsylvania Cover Letter to the Scientists and Economists' Call for Swift and Deep Cuts in Greenhouse Gas Emissions will be delivered to Pennsylvania representatives during the week of June 22nd and to senators later this summer or fall.
The cover letter and underlying statement are open to Pennsylvania Ph.D. or doctoral candidate professionals with expertise relevant to our understanding of the scientific and economic dimensions of climate change, its impacts, and solutions.
Breakthrough Institute is a small think tank in Oakland that has done some of the most rigorous analyses of the Waxman-Markey climate legislation to date.
Our analysis of the bill demonstrates that the “cap” does not require any emissions reductions below business-as-usual estimates.
In other words, it’s a cap in name only.
The bill also includes a "renewable energy standard" that does not actually require any renewables to be deployed beyond what would be done without the bill.
The Obama administration and congressional Democrats have proposed a major cap-and-trade system aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
Scientists agree that CO2 emissions around the world could lead to rising temperatures with serious long-term environmental consequences.
But that is not a reason to enact a U.S. cap-and-trade system until there is a global agreement on CO2 reduction.
The proposed legislation would have a trivially small effect on global warming while imposing substantial costs on all American households.
And to get political support in key states, the legislation would abandon the auctioning of permits in favor of giving permits to selected corporations.
...
In my judgment, the proposed cap-and-trade system would be a costly policy that would penalize Americans with little effect on global warming.
The proposal to give away most of the permits only makes a bad idea worse.
Taxpayers and legislators should keep these things in mind before enacting any cap-and-trade system.
My feeling is that there is little to no chance of global agreement until the U.S. shows that it is unilaterally committed to a climate change policy.
Plus, there are significant co-benefits of reductions in energy use in the U.S. so the "no benefit" headline is a serious misrepresentation of the policy.
Continental shelves beneath the retreating polar ice caps of the Arctic may hold almost double the amount of oil previously found in the region, scientists say.
Unless a weekend of breathing ceramic tile dust and adhesive fumes has dulled my economic senses, an upward revision of future potential oil discoveries, along with it's promise of lower future gas prices, should decrease the demand for gas today and put downward pressure on as prices, oh about, now.
And another thought: might that global warming thing everyone is talking about make it easier to get to that undiscovered oil once it's discovered?
Y'know, with less ice to get in the way and all.
Talk about a vicious (arctic?
) circle.

Twenty leading U.S. climate scientists and experts today released the attached Open Letter to the President and Members of Congress.
The letter, among the strongest public statements on climate change from U.S. scientists to date, addresses the Waxman-Markey bill now pending in the House of Representatives, and calls upon President Obama for an expanded leadership role.
An Open Letter to the President and Members of Congress Strong Leadership Needed Now on Climate
Strong leadership by the United States will be required to move the nations of the world away from what scientists increasingly recognize as a rapidly developing global climatic catastrophe.
That leadership requires the insight, energy and relentless attention of the President and no less vigorous interest from both houses of the U. S. Congress.
The Waxman-Markey bill now being considered by the Congress offers a powerful advance and must be enacted this year.
But at its best it will be only a first step in the direction that scientists now recognize as necessary to protect local and regional climates.
Our purpose is to call attention to the large difference between what U.S. politics now seems capable of enacting and what scientists understand is necessary to prevent climatic disruption and protect the human future.
We urge President Obama to exercise maximum personal leadership beginning now to ensure that the strongest possible legislation emerges from the Congress.
New information arrives daily to confirm what many specialists have known for three decades: human-caused climatic disruption is serious, moving rapidly, and gaining momentum with every delay in correcting the trend.
In 1992 more than 180 nations including the United States met in Rio de Janeiro, signed, and later ratified, the Framework Convention on Climate Change and in so doing agreed to “stabilize” the heat-trapping gases of the atmosphere at levels that will protect human interests and nature.
We, the nations globally, have not been true to our word, and climate is moving out from under civilization rapidly.
Major droughts on every continent are but one current symptom of the scale of the global environmental corruption now entrained.
In many political circles around the world, the view has taken hold that nations should endeavor both to limit the buildup of carbon dioxide, the principal greenhouse gas and a by-product of burning coal, oil and natural gas, to 450 parts per million and to limit the rise of global temperatures to less than 2°Celsius.
We and many others are of the view that these objectives are inadequate to sustain the integrity of global climate and to hold the risk of ruinous climatic change to an acceptably low level.
United States policy must provide a fully satisfactory U.S. contribution to global greenhouse gas reductions that move beyond these inadequate international limits.
It is essential that the Waxman-Markey bill, strengthened wherever possible and certainly not weakened, advance into law rapidly.
It is also essential that it become the basis for a serious, continuing, and urgent effort on the part of the President to lead the American public into recognition of the scale of the climatic disruption so that the U.S. will embrace still stronger policies to do what we know from scientific investigation is necessary to prevent disastrous climatic alteration.
As we write, we see the unfolding Presidential effort to lead the nation in the area of universal health insurance.
We urge the President to initiate an effort at least comparable in the area of climatic change.
We recognize the difference in popularity of these two causes, but it is the essence of Presidential leadership to show the way even where adequate public awareness of the risks ahead may be lacking.
Speaking in Germany recently, President Obama referred to climatic change as “a potentially cataclysmic disaster.” We agree and believe that message must be communicated and elaborated to the American people in time to assure strong, effective Congressional action in both houses of Congress this year.
The time for national action on climatic change is now.
There has already been too much delay.
The stakes are far too high to compromise the integrity of, and our responsibility for, prompt national action.

Now, the WSJ reports that the White House actually expects to raise two to three times as much revenue from the climate bill.
That would appear to mean that prices for emissions permits will be a lot higher than anyone is expecting—which would be both good news and bad news.
Now, as much as that’s exercised the folks at Planet Gore, the administration already warned that its budget figure was conservative.
And it also explicitly said that any additional climate proceeds would be returned to taxpayers.
So the issue isn’t what would happen with extra climate revenues.
But it does seem to require a rethink of what the economic impact of the climate plan will be.
Based on the figures in the budget, the price of those permits to emit greenhouse gases appeared to be between $10 and $14 a ton—all kinds of assumptions like future energy use and the pace of economic recovery make the math a little fuzzy.
There seem to be only three ways to get double or triple the total climate revenues.
Simply selling more permits and giving away fewer to industry for free would raise more money.
The problem is that the budget already anticipates selling 100% of the emissions permits, and if anything President Obama is hinting at backing off that campaign pledge.
So the climate plan could cast its net wider and cover a broader spectrum of the American economy.
The more sectors that are bound to reduce emissions, and thus buy carbon permits, the bigger the revenues.
The problem there is that most of the blueprints in Washington for climate legislation already talk about “economy-wide” cap-and-trade schemes—not much scope to make economy-wide even wider.

The Kyoto Protocol, which mandates taking action to reduce GHG emissions through emissions trading and/or other means has been ratified by 183 countries.
Outside the US, There are cap and trade systems that have been implemented or proposed in most of the developed world including the EU, Swtizerland, Norway, Japan, Australia, New Zealand.
There is clear consensus among the world’s scientific organizations that the climate is changing due to man’s actions.
Can you name one that has a published peer reviewed study that concludes otherwise?
I thought not.
The vast global conspiracy theory, unsupported by any facts, just doesn’t sway me.

The Banks–what kind of fuzzy left wing thinking is this–
I was at an event recently at NYU’s Center for Global Affairs (where I’m teaching) and Elisabeth Rosenthal, the “NY Times” environmental reporter based in Europe, was being interviewed.
She touched on a number of important subjects including the talks in Poznań in December, some of the international politics of climate change, and an interesting approach to green building: “passive” houses .
Passive houses employ fairly simple principles of ultraefficient insulation and heat exchange.
In the same vein - simple and easy - she had an article recently on the burgeoning practice in Britain of converting used cooking oil to transportation fuel .
There’s a terrific article from another terrific environmental reporter, Fiona Harvey, in today’s “FT” about biochar.
This is a comprehensive look at a technology that has enormous potential to not only sequester billions of tons of carbon but also to reduce the need for nitrogen fertilizers that cost farmers all over the world boatloads of money and also cause massive environmental damage, including pouring nitrous oxide, a potent GHG, into the atmosphere.
Where do you get the biomass?
Agricultural waste and certain components of municipal solid waste are two excellent sources.
How do you make it?
Pyrolysis - “a form of controlled thermal decomposition of organic material in the absence of oxygen.” (Long before I knew about biochar, I conceived of pyrolysis as an integral part of an urban solid waste management scheme that I’d noodled and promulgated to a great number of people in New York City.
See the last paragraph of this post from a couple of years ago for more on my “Urban Gold” concept.

Biotic Carbon, the carbon transformed by life, should never be combusted, oxidized and destroyed.
It deserves more respect, reverence even, and understanding to use it back to the soil where 2/3 of excess atmospheric carbon originally came from.
We all know we are carbon-centered life, we seldom think about the complex web of recycled bio-carbon which is the true center of life.
A cradle to cradle, mutually co-evolved biosphere reaching into every crack and crevice on Earth.
It’s hard for most to revere microbes and fungus, but from our toes to our gums (onward), their balanced ecology is our health.
The greater earth and soils are just as dependent, at much longer time scales.
Our farming for over 10,000 years has been responsible for 2/3rds of our excess greenhouse gases.
This soil carbon, converted to carbon dioxide, Methane & Nitrous oxide began a slow stable warming that now accelerates with burning of fossil fuel.
Biochar, the modern version of an ancient Amazonian agricultural practice called Terra Preta (black earth, TP), is gaining widespread credibility as a way to address world hunger, climate change, rural poverty, deforestation, and energy shortages… SIMULTANEOUSLY!

EcoTechnologies is planning for many collaborations ; NC State, U. of Leeds, Cardiff U. Rice U. ,JMU, U.of H. and at USDA with Dr.Jeffrey Novak who is coordinating ARS Biochar research.
This Coordinated effort will speed implementation by avoiding unneeded repetition and building established work in a wide variety of soils and climates.
Much of the black carbon issue in South Asia is related to using dung and other very low grade fuels for cooking.
Not only is this an issue for climate change, it is a major woman’s and children’s health issue because they are inside during the cooking.
Anyone following the recent string of articles in the mainstream press attacking the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) may have entertained a sneaking suspicion that the hidden hand of the climate denial lobby was at work behind many of them.
That suspicion, it turns out, is exactly right – the fingerprints of the deniers are all over several of the key stories.
This latest feeding frenzy kicked off when one erroneous claim – that Himalayan glaciers were “very likely” to disappear by 2035 – was found to have slipped through the net, the IPCC’s extensive review process having failed to weed it out prior to publication.
The claim was included on page 493 of the IPCC’s second 1000-page Working Group report on “Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability” (WGII).
The reference given was to a WWF report – part of the non-peer-reviewed “grey literature” that makes up a periphery of the material in the second Working Group’s report.
Blogger Richard North was the originator of one such story.
North is a climate change denier who has worked with the Telegraph’s Christopher Booker on a number of publications, including most recently Scared to Death: From BSE to Global Warming: Why Scares are Costing Us the Earth.
In the words of sceptical writer Richard Wilson, the book is a “ surrealist masterpiece ”, claiming to debunk “the dangers of passive smoking, white asbestos, eating BSE-infected beef, CO2 emissions, leaded petrol, dioxins, and high-speed car driving”.
Examining the book’s commentary on climate change, one atmosphere physicist noted that its “references are very selective and misrepresentative”; another concluded: “[t]hese people have added two and two and got five”.
The book misrepresents and even reverses the findings of published scientific literature, and includes a fabricated interview with a Cambridge astrophysicist that had long since been retracted.
As the Guardian’s Robin McKie puts it in his review of the book , Booker and North “accuse other journalists of ‘unthinking credulity’ but commit egregious errors that would shame a junior reporter.”
On January 25th, North published a post on his blog in which he dredged up one suspicious-looking claim made by the IPCC.
On page 596, the second Working Group report had stated that “40% of the Amazon forests could react drastically to even a slight change in precipitation”, potentially being replaced by “ecosystems that have more resistance to multiple stresses caused by temperature increase, droughts and fires, such as tropical savannas”.
Again, the reference given was to a WWF report – in this case a Global Review of Forest Fires by a policy analyst, Dr PF Moore, and a journalist and campaigner, Andy Rowell.
Apparently unable to find the information given by the IPCC in WWF’s report, North wrote:
“The assertions attributed to them, that “up to 40% of the Amazonian forests could react drastically to even a slight reduction in precipitation” is nowhere to be found in their report.
… Nor elsewhere can we find any other reference to 40 percent of the Amazon being affected by even slight reductions in precipitation.”
Nevertheless, North went to town, declaring the unearthing of “Amazongate”.
He accused the IPCC of making “false predictions on the Amazon rain forests”; of producing “a complete fabrication”; stated that “the IPCC has grossly exaggerated the effects of global warming on the Amazon rain forest”; that it “wanted to hype up crisis” by “making an assertion unsupported by the “science” it holds as so important”.
The allegation was quickly repeated by a sympathetic blogger on the fringes of the mainstream media, James Delingpole of the Telegraph – himself a frenetic climate change denier and far-right conspiracy theorist (he has recently stated that mainstream climate scientists “are part of a global conspiracy to expand” the state – apparently on the basis of no evidence whatsoever).
Delingpole eagerly posted the story on his blog, declaring “AGW [man-made global warming] theory is toast.”
A few days later, the story found its way onto the news pages of the Times, via reporter Jonathan Leake.
“UN climate panel shamed by bogus rainforest claim”, the story’s headline declared, its first paragraph telling readers the IPCC’s statement on the Amazon was “based on an unsubstantiated claim”.
The last line of the article leaves us in no doubt as to its source: “Research by Richard North”.
“Indeed, some leading models of future climate change impacts show a die-off of more than 40% Amazon forests, due to projected decreases in rainfall.
“The most extreme die-back model predicted that a new type of drought should begin to impact Amazonia, and in 2005 it happened for the first time: a drought associated with Atlantic, not Pacific sea surface temperatures.
“The effect on the forest was massive tree mortality, and the remaining Amazon forests changed from absorbing nearly two billion tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere a year, to being a massive source of over three billion tonnes.”
As Lewis made clear in correspondence, the problem was not with the accuracy of the IPCC’s statement, which reflected the peer-reviewed scientific literature – but with the reference that had been attributed to it.
The issue had in fact already been dealt with in the report of Working Group I (on “The Physical Science Basis” of climate change), which had got the references right.
Did Leake’s article accurately reflect Lewis’ views?
“Absolutely not.”
“At the time of the IPCC [report], there was ample evidence that a large portion of the Amazon forest is very close to the lower limit of rainfall that is necessary to sustain dense forest.
We published an article in 1994 in Nature in which we estimated that approximately half of the forests of the Brazilian Amazon were periodically exposed to severe drought and soil moisture depletion, especially during El Nino events.”
“The IPCC statement on the Amazon is correct, but the citations listed in the Rowell and Moore report were incomplete.
(The authors of this report interviewed several researchers, including the author of this note, and had originally cited the IPAM website where the statement was made that 30 to 40% of the forests of the Amazon were susceptible to small changes in rainfall).
Our 1999 article (Nepstad et al.
1999) estimated that 630,000 km2 of forests were severely drought stressed in 1998, as [WWF authors] Rowell and Moore correctly state, but this forest area is only 15% of the total area of forest in the Brazilian Amazon.
In another article published in Nature, in 1994, we used less conservative assumptions to estimate that approximately half of the forests of the Amazon depleted large portions of their available soil moisture during seasonal or episodic drought (Nepstad et al.
1994). After the Rowell and Moore report was released in 2000, and prior to the publication of the IPCC AR4, new evidence of the full extent of severe drought in the Amazon was available.
In 2004, we estimated that half of the forest area of the Amazon Basin had either fallen below, or was very close to, the critical level of soil moisture below which trees begin to die in 1998.
This estimate incorporated new rainfall data and results from an experimental reduction of rainfall in an Amazon forest that we had conducted with funding from the US National Science Foundation (Nepstad et al.
2004). Field evidence of the soil moisture critical threshold is presented in Nepstad et al.
2007.”
To give him some credit, Leake’s “bogus” headline has now been changed – though his “unsubstantiated” accusation remains.
Meanwhile, things have gone full circle: the story is being cited in its original form on the website of climate deniers – and mining industry front-group – the Global Warming Policy Foundation, replete with the added credibility its status as a Times story gives it.
While it is wholly unsurprising that the denial lobby should be attempting to push baseless and misleading stories to the press, what is surprising is the press’s willingness to swallow them.
In this case, two experts in the relevant field told a Times journalist explicitly that, in spite of a minor referencing error, the IPCC had got its facts right.
That journalist simply ignored them.
Instead, he deliberately put out the opposite line – one fed to him by a prominent climate change denier – as fact.
The implications are deeply disturbing, not only for our prospects of tackling climate change, but for basic standards of honesty and integrity in journalism.
lol!
You people are the real ‘deniers’ — and at least 4 weeks behind the stack of ‘gate’ revelations.
Please read my latest article proving that the crooks at GHCN falsified the raw data of the world’s second oldest uninterrupted climate record in the Czech Republic.
Yes, folks, we now have ‘Czechgate’ — try waffling this baby away.…
Thanks for that review, I got to this page via Real Climate.
Well worth reading, and well put together.
I don’t agree — and even your comment about “swallowing” all this rubbish underplays what is happening.
Throughout the world, including here in New Zealand, the mainstream press and media have been one of the worst offenders in pushing a global warming denialist agenda.
They are past masters at the misuse of the principle of “balance” with which they seek to disguise their active participation in this so-called “debate”.
Without the cooperation of a complicit media, these denialilsts would never have had the traction they now have.
But there was no research referenced linking climate change to a reduction in rainfall in the Amazon; the referenced research, if you tracked it back, was talking about how logging, agriculture, and fire were increasing the risk of drought damage in 40% of the forest.
In Europe floods have been raging with unprecdented regularity, whilst in California fires are raging regularly due to repeated and lengthy droughts.
Before we start quibbling about what is happening where, let’s consider the fact that sea levels are in fact rising.
That the ocean of the world react (in human terms) very slowly to changes in climate, should give any thinking person pause for thought.
If they are reflecting the effects of climate change, shouldn’t we be doing something about it?
Tim Holmes: ‘The issue had in fact already been dealt with in the report of Working Group I (on “The Physical Science Basis” of climate change), which had got the references right.’
Whether or not WG1 dealt with the issue, it’s clear from the work of Nepstad and others that logging is the main threat to the Amazon forests, not only directly but by reducing rainfall.
More severe and frequent GHG-driven regional droughts might play a larger role in the future but as the areas most vulnerable to drought are those that are being most heavily logged (Nepstad 2004), it’s questionable whether the most vulnerable forests will still be standing by the time the droughts get worse.
That is a valid point and I haven’t had time to scour up any stats.
The thing is that even the “not so vulnerrable” regions are going to be affected by human induced global warming to some extent.
Anyone got any figures?
This web page will introduce and lead you through the content of the most comprehensive and authoritative report of its kind.
The report summarizes the science and the impacts of climate change on the United States, now and in the future.
It focuses on climate change impacts in different regions of the U.S. and on various aspects of society and the economy such as energy, water, agriculture, and health.
It’s also a report written in plain language, with the goal of better informing public and private decision making at all levels.
In addition to discussing the impacts of climate change in the U.S., the report also highlights the choices we face in response to human-induced climate change.
It is clear that impacts in the United States are already occurring and are projected to increase in the future, particularly if the concentration of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere continues to rise.
So, choices about how we manage greenhouse gas emissions will have far-reaching consequences for climate change impacts.
Similarly, there are choices to be made about adaptation strategies that can help to reduce or avoid some of the undesirable impacts of climate change.
This report provides many of the scientific underpinnings for effective decisions to be made – at the national and at the regional level.
Climate changes are underway in the United States and are projected to grow.
Climate-related changes are already observed in the United States and its coastal waters.
These include increases in heavy downpours, rising temperature and sea level, rapidly retreating glaciers, thawing permafrost, lengthening growing seasons, lengthening ice-free seasons in the ocean and on lakes and rivers, earlier snowmelt, and alterations in river flows.
These changes are projected to grow.
Crop and livestock production will be increasingly challenged.
Agriculture is considered one of the sectors most adaptable to changes in climate.
However, increased heat, pests, water stress, diseases, and weather extremes will pose adaptation challenges for crop and livestock production.
Threats to human health will increase.
Health impacts of climate change are related to heat stress, waterborne diseases, poor air quality, extreme weather events, and diseases transmitted by insects and rodents.
Robust public health infrastructure can reduce the potential for negative impacts.
If nothing else, the Waxman-Markey climate change bill is keeping the think tanks and Washington lobbyists busy.
I’ve been surveying analyses and comment from critics including The Heritage Foundation (“a massive energy tax in disguise that promises job losses, income cuts, and a sharp left turn toward big government”), former Lotus CEO Jim Manzi in The National Review (“a terrible deal for American taxpayers”), the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (“expensive, complicated, regulation-heavy, domestic-only legislation”), The Breakthrough Institute (“may allow American emissions to continue to rise for up to twenty years”) as well as Greenpeace (“not strong enough to stop global warming”) and Friends of the Earth (“we have serious concerns and misgivings that prevent us from offering our support”).
Now we are getting analyses of the analyses, such as the NRDC’s Laurie Johnson’s persuasive takedown of Heritage’s work.
Lest you think that the climate-change bill lacks supporters, Environmental Defense last week released a list of backers that includes a broad swath of corporate America (GE, GM, PG&E, Exelon, Duke Energy, Shell, Starbucks and Nike), labor (the UAW, United Mineworkers, SEIU) and nonprofits (NRDC, Sierra Club, World Wildlife Fund, League of Women Voters, Consumers Union, National Wildlife Federation, etc.
)
What does Waxman-Markey have to say about kites?
Nothing, it turns out.
(No, I haven’t read the 932-page bill, but I did a search for the word kites) That’s actually a good thing.
By contrast, the bill has at least 40 references to coal, as best as I can tell.
According to this summary of the bill by House staffers provided by the tireless blogger and climate expert Joe Romm, the bill provides an estimated $60 billion in investments in carbon capture and sequestration technology and it uses a mix of “regulatory requirements and financial incentives” to ensure that new coal-fired power plants will operate with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technology.
For example, Waxman-Markey decrees that…
To be sure, we need an energy revolution.
Nothing less than the transformation of our fossil fuel-based economy into one that is cleaner and greener will solve the global warming crisis.
Most important, we need to do whatever we can to spread that energy revolution to India, China and the rest of the developing world, because if we go green and they don’t, well, we’re still cooked.
But how do we get from here to there?
With clean coal?
Electric-car batteries?
Heat pumps?
Wood stoves?
Kites?
The unfortunate answer is no one knows.
Not the president, not Congress, not Nobel laureate and energy secretary Chu, not venture capitalists or energy company CEOS or Fred Krupp or Jeff Immelt or Joe Romm.
Our energy and climate problems are knowledge problems, too.
And the best way to solve knowledge problems – which is to say the best way to spur technology change – is to create conditions that get lots of scientists and engineers to work on them, invite lots of investors to place their bets on which ones will work and then test those ideas in the marketplace.
By aggregating thousands of decisions, markets will help us figure out which of today’s technologies or which ones yet to be invented get us closer to the clean energy economy we need.
The real question is, just what form should the government action take?
I’m all in favor of government funding for basic research, like the defense-oriented communications research that eventually made possible the creation of the Internet.
I’m not opposed to the government using its considerable purchasing power to stimulate markets for electric cars or renewable energy, as it did when it installed a big solar power plant at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada.
But when it comes to energy and climate, I’d prefer to see a policy that is strong, simple, transparent, flexible and neutral when it comes to making technology choices.
Outcome-based, if you will.
A policy that uses a light but firm touch to unleash the power of markets to drive change.
This is what cap-and-trade, the centerpiece of Waxman-Markey, was supposed to do.
Cap-and-trade puts a price on carbon, which is a jargon-y way of saying that it corrects a market failure, namely, the fact that people who burn fossil fuels (i.e., all of us) are not currently paying the costs of emitting global warming pollutants into the earth’s atmosphere.
Cap-and-trade is an appealing policy because it addresses the fundamental problem—the global warming pollutants that cause climate change—but it is scrupulously neutral about the solutions.
A carbon tax is an alternative way to accomplish the same thing.
Now I understand that the carbon price that would be created by Waxman-Markey’s cap-and-trade scheme is unlikely to climb high enough quickly enough to reshape energy markets and spur new technology.
The EPA estimates that the carbon price—that is, the amount that polluters will have to pay to emit a ton of carbon—will be $11 to $15 in 2012, $13 to $17 in 2015, $17 to $22 in 2020, and $22 to $28 in 2025.
That’s only pennies (or dimes or quarters) at the gas pump, the experts say, not enough to start a revolution.
This is why there is so much more loaded into Waxman-Markey, including renewable portfolio standards, efficiency standards, more than $190 billion (through 2025) in clean energy and efficiency investments, and so forth.
Having said all that, Waxman-Markey may, unfortunately, be the best we can do in the current context.
The environmental movement is politically weak.
Coal-state politicians need to be won over.
Neither the president nor Congress seem ready to begin a serious conversation with Americans about taxes, even those that are revenue neutral.
Although some green groups say the bill won’t do nearly enough to address global warming, I was heartened last week to see that the World Resources Institute, a widely-respected NGO, released its own study arguing that the bill, as it now stands, would reduce GHG emissions by 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 and 75 percent below 2005 levels by 2050.
See the chart below.

The dust is still whirling around the Australian political landscape.
As I write, not only are the coalition talks barely beginning, but with five seats still in doubt it’s not yet clear where the balance of power lies.
Last week, we saw that Australian PM Julia Gillard’s proposal for a citizens’ assembly to analyse and propose climate policy was widely criticised – but that despite the hype, there really wasn’t any evidence that it was turning the election against Labor.
A week on, and it looks like the fuss about Gillard’s plan has completely disappeared, and climate change has become the muzzled dog of the campaign.
The Australian media has been deeply critical of Julia Gillard’s proposal for a citizens’ assembly to explore policy responses to climate change.
It’s been attacked both by advocates, and critics, of action to tackle climate change – with the coverage attributing particular significance in the heat of the election campaign.
Gillard’s proposal is for a 150-strong assembly of citizens, selected to be nationally representative, which would analyse and discuss climate issues, and make recommendations to policy-makers.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald , a majority of 53% oppose the proposal, while 41% support it.
Another poll for the Daily Telegraph apparently found 62% opposed.
Despite this, some of the coverage has presented public reaction in a very different light.
According to the Australian , “voters have turned against Labor’s proposal for a citizens assembly on climate change”.
3AW claim it could be “the ‘turning point’” of the election.
How far is concern about climate change the preserve of the elite?
It’s a simple question, but one that I’ve not previously seen answered convincingly.
Many of the polls I’ve covered break out the data by social grade and education, but yet none of them show really clear distinctions in attitudes towards climate change.
However, a new poll by YouGov does show something different.
Their poll was commissioned by Chatham House, and sampled both UK general public, and a YouGov panel of ‘influential people’.
Here, there was more difference between the audiences than I’ve seen from looking at distinctions of social grade or education, with the elite panel apparently significantly more concerned about climate change than the rest of the population.
The survey looks at various aspects of foreign affairs, with two questions that touch on climate change.
The first asks about “current of possible future threats to the British way of life”.
In the general public sample, 25% choose climate change/global warming (sixth placed); among the elites, 44% do so (fourth placed).
(Respondents were limited to choosing a max of four issues – so the difference can’t just be explained by one audience picking many more threats overall)
Similarly, in terms of tackling climate change, the elite panel are much more convinced of the need for action:
I was at the excellent Blog Nation conference in London this weekend, organised by Liberal Conspiracy .
While I think it’s hugely important that tackling climate change shouldn’t be seen as a party political, or a left/right issue, the conference was a good opportunity for leftish bloggers and campaigners to talk about plans for the next few months and years.
There are two major issues in public perceptions of climate change in the UK at the moment.
The first is to do with understanding and enthusiasm/engagement.
While climategate etc has only had a fairly limited impact on perceptions, and while only very few are convinced that man-made climate change isn’t happening, as many as two-thirds are unconvinced that climate change is a big issue.
This is a substantial proportion, suggesting a widespread lack of enthusiasm among the public about the issue.
The second challenge is to do with who the public are hearing about climate change from.
At least in the UK, politicians are the group who are most visible talking about climate change, but they’re also the most distrusted.
So even where people are generally quite willing to take action, or make lifestyle changes, to deal with climate change, they’re very suspicious when they hear politicians saying that they should do so.
The Understanding Risk group have recently released their data for a UK national poll focused on climate change and energy sources.
It’s got loads to look at, and the results can be interpreted in various ways, particularly with the comparison with a 2005 data .
One way of looking at it is that there’s no evidence that people have become any more worried about climate change since 2005 (and arguably have become less concerned).
But most people are still pretty worried, and levels of outright rejection are still very low.
A poll from Stanford shows that in the US about a third now remember hearing stories about climate scientists’ emails, and about a quarter remember stories about the IPCC’s reports.
The unspecified climate scientists come out slightly better than the IPCC – perhaps reflecting US feelings about international institutions.
(Thanks Bob Ward for pointing this one out)
Another US poll , this one from Yale/George Mason, indicates that scientists are the most trusted source of information about global warming – and that trust has recovered after a small drop in January (though not much beyond margin of error).
Another part of this poll is accessible here .
There’s an excellent article in a recent New Scientist, which makes a powerful case for rethinking the way climate change is communicated.
While the article , by Bob Ward, is controversial, and may jar with a lot of climate scientists and communicators, much of what we’ve seen here in the public opinion data bear him out, and his conclusions seem sound.
The article starts with the assertion that climate scientists’ reputation has been damaged by the challenges to the analyses of the IPCC and UEA’s research teams.
This is plausible, though I’m reluctant to accept the direct comparison made with the damage suffered by the Roman Catholic Church and the UK Parliament over the last couple of years.
It’s true there’s been some decline in conviction in the UK that man-made climate change is happening, but I’m yet to see evidence that this was a direct consequence of the stories about the IPCC and UEA.
The polls around the time of the coverage of the UEA email hack suggested little change in public opinion ; it wasn’t until the freezing winter that the numbers really moved (though: post hoc ergo propter hoc – this doesn’t prove that the cold weather caused the shift).
It may indeed be the case that scientists have become less trusted as communicators about climate change, but as far as I’m aware this hypothesis hasn’t yet been proved.
Nevertheless, Ward’s broader argument still stands.
Even if lack of trust in climate scientists is not necessarily itself a major issue, there clearly is a problem.
Public interest, belief, and commitment to tackling climate change appear to be fairly malleable , and are affected substantially by short-term factors like the weather – rather than by developments in the science.
The activities of critics of climate research are also effectively keeping alive the question of whether or not man-made climate change is happening, to a greater extent than may be justified.
On top of this, politicians appear to be the main group who are heard talking about talking climate change, yet they’re also the group who are least trusted to do so.
As Ward argues, climate science is making a mistake in “hunkering down and hoping for the best”.
Instead, it should learn from how other organisations have recovered from similar challenges.
Quoting from a PR strategist at Weber Shandwick, he suggests a course of action that’s quite different from the approaches that appear to have been taken recently:
It may be natural to assume that one of the things that will come out of the Gulf oil spill is a swing in US opinion, away from oil exploration, and towards less polluting sources.
But the polls are surprisingly undramatic on the subject.
Overall, there appears be less growth than might be expected in US public opposition to offshore drilling
Unexpectedly, the best answer for confirming this appears to come from Fox News.
As luck would have it, they polled on offshore drilling two weeks before the crisis started, and have repeated the same question twice since then: “Do you favor or oppose increasing offshore drilling for oil and gas in U.S. coastal areas?”.
The results are clear – a drop, but not a haemorrhage, in support for drilling:
After a pause in hostilities for the election, it looks like the favourite climate story of the year has resurfaced.
A new poll is out and being covered with the headline that fewer people now believe in climate change or think that it’s an urgent issue demanding attention.
There’s some truth in the basic argument that people are now less convinced and worried about climate change than they have been in the past.
But when the Guardian runs a story like this , it gets widely noticed and repeated, and there are several reasons why we shouldn’t get too carried away by the news.
In February, there was quite a bit of print, broadcast and online coverage for a BBC poll that showed a fall in public belief in climate change.
According to the BBC’s numbers, the proportion saying that “climate change is happening and is now established as largely man-made” fell from 41% in November ’09 to 26% in February ’10.
A couple of weeks later, the Guardian reported a different poll by the ad agency Euro RSCG.
This one showed that the proportion that thinks that climate change “is definitely a reality” dropped from 44% to 31% between January ’09 and January ’10.
In fact, the Guardian enjoyed the poll so much, they reported it a second time , two weeks later.
So when we hear about yet another poll that shows a drop in belief or concern about climate change between last year and this year, we’re probably not seeing anything new.
A check of the numbers in the YouGov poll confirms this.
The Oz election is pretty exciting, but climate change has now pretty well disappeared from it http://bit.ly/a4c9ur #ausvotes 08:15:30 AM August 09, 2010 from API

Episode 3 of The Barometer is now out!
We’re investigating the poles this month.
There’s an interview with a couple of guys from the Centre for Atmospheric Science who’ve worked in the Arctic and an interview with the organiser of Polar Live with a couple of clips of music that’ll be played at that concert.
He was always a bit of a favourite with the “skeptics” by saying that there was little economic argument to act on climate change.
And that it was a bit of an obsession with middle class people in developed nations.
Well, it gets you thinking at the very least.
However, he is not without his critics – The Lomborg Deception , for example, aimed to take apart some of his arguments.
10 years ago, I guess a great way to get people to listen to you would have been to say that acting on climate change was a waste of time.
That’s what Lomborg did and he was certainly listened to.
Right now, given all the media puff about climate science all being a scam, it seems that the best way to get publicity is to come out say that climate change is “a challenge humanity must confront”.
I can’t help feeling that the last 10 years have been wasted (from the point of view of engaging policy makers and the public with the implications of climate change) and that Lomborg played quite a big part in that.
So the saying kind of works because, if you see some altocumulus then it is quite likely to be at the leading end of a warm front.
This means that some bad weather may be on its way.
Sure enough, here’s the current Met Office forecast (though I doubt that this was constructed by looking up at the clouds!
):
The other question that comes up here is: why is the altocumulus red?
The quick answer is that its at about the right height to pick out the red light that is scattered from the sunlight that is travelling through the atmosphere at a particular angle in the mornings and the evenings but see here for a more complete discussion.
We’ve just released episode 2 of The Barometer, this time we’re talking about the volcano.
This is quite relevant to us as members of the Centre for Atmospheric Science were involved in taking observations (ground and air based) and talking to the media about the situation as it developed.
“Climategate” was raised at one point but wasn’t really discussed much.
Despite my interest in climate science, I think that not dwelling on the UEA emails was probably for the best.
No-one that’s spent much time on that issue has come out of it well (apart from those fantasists that now have a fragment of reality to associate with their conspiracy theories).
One point that I should have made was that it’s all very well flinging mud and picking at the science from the edges but until the “sceptic” bloggers face the same scrutiny as those they attack (both in the press and scientific journals) there’s no level playing field here and this, in my view, needs resolving.
Blog comments came up and was an interesting discussion, including the idea that readers could be charged for leaving comments!
I’m particularly interested in reader comments as, from the point of view of climate science, I’m always amazed at how many comments climate blogs and newspaper articles generate.
With Alok and Mark there, I would’ve loved to hear how trolling patterns have changed at The Times since the paywall went up and whether the Grauniad has any plans to restrict commenting to unidentifiable individuals.
Ed Yong brought up some work by the Pew Research Center that looked at the proportion of stories on science in new (10%) and old media (1%), citing this as a success for science blogging.
This research slightly worries me because the Traditional Press column only adds up to 73% where the Blogs one gets to 100% but the bigger point, which Mark Henderson raised, was that the volume of science blogs is not necessarily a good thing as a lot of these blogs are written by, for example, climate change deniers and quacks.
Well, nice point but a shame that The Times’ science supplement Eureka put one of the top climate change “sceptic” sites – Watts Up With That?
– in its Top 30 Science Blogs earlier this year!
Unfortunately, the event ended there and I didn’t get a chance to put this point to Mark (and maybe it would’ve been a bit mean.
)
But after spending 20 minutes or so reading it, I started to wonder “why am I bothering?” Monckton has never demonstrated himself to be a reliable source of information on climate science (or other things) yet he’s managed to get into a position where people listen to him.
“Climate science is a matter of such global importance, that the highest standards of honesty, rigour and openness are needed in its conduct.
On the specific allegations made against the behaviour of CRU scientists, we find that their rigour and honesty as scientists are not in doubt.”
“But we do find that there has been a consistent pattern of failing to display the proper degree of openness, both on the part of the CRU scientists and on the part of the UEA, who failed to recognise not only the significance of statutory requirements but also the risk to the reputation of the University and, indeed, to the credibility of UK climate science.”
“Clouds and aerosols” get their own chapter and regional climate change is mentioned, which are key areas that need addressing .
Irreversibility is also now considered.
So, here’s a shameless plug for a new podcast we’ve put together at the Centre for Atmospheric Science, University of Manchester.
We’ve tried to keep it short (this episode is about 14mins long), fun (the theme of the main discussion in this episode in the atmosphere of the World Cup) and topical (there’s some quick News stories in there too).
I'm a researcher working on weather and climate science.
I investigate European extreme events and Antarctic climate change.
This blog charts my reactions to news stories on weather and climate and why I love atmospheric science.
How much of what is recorded as scepticism about the scientific reality of climate change is simply a desire for it not to be true – or at the very least, for it not to be as bad as the scientists and politicians say?
This is a question that cannot easily be answered.
When people are motivated not to believe something, they are also motivated not to acknowledge that their non-belief is anything other than rational.
But two fishy tales shed some light on one type of climate change scepticism, and highlight a major challenge for climate change communicators: how do you persuade someone to believe something that they really don’t want to believe?
Last month in Doha, delegates at the Washington Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species voted against a ban on fishing bluefin tuna.
The decision was widely condemned by environmental groups, and in the Guardian , George Monbiot described the refusal to acknowledge the critically endangered state of the bluefin tuna as:
‘ Bottomfeeder ’, by Taras Grescoe is a book about the overfishing and ultimate demise of many of the world’s fisheries.
Combining barely-believable statistics about the collapse of once abundant oceanic ecosystems (some estimates put European fish populations at 5% of their first-recorded levels) and interviews with countless fishermen and traders in ports and harbours around the world, Grescoe builds up a bewildering picture of the world’s seas.
While the evidence is anecdotal rather than statistical, it is striking just how many of the fishermen (and it is primarily men) that Grescoe speaks to are adamant that climate change is warming their seas and driving away their catch.
Their belief that the seas are warming is correct – but the biggest impact on the number of fish they are pulling out of the sea is intensive overfishing.
Far fewer of Grescoe’s interviewees acknowledge this – blaming seals, foreigners, and global warming before conceding that perhaps their methods of fishing might be having an effect.
So, notorious Guardian message board climate change sceptic CheshireRed solemnly supports the protestors who seek to prevent overfishing of the bluefin tuna, and accepts that those who are responsible for the overfishing are in denial about the cause of the problem – but does not accept the overwhelming scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change.
Conversely, the fishermen responsible for overfishing happily accept climate change but doubt that their actions have any impact on the state of the world’s fisheries.
I’m going to go out on a limb and guess that CheshireRed (and his message board buddies) are not sea fishermen, with a vested interest in underplaying the impact of overfishing.
However, like most of us in the developed world they have a personal stake in climate change being shown to be a scam – it would eliminate the need to change our high-consuming lifestyles.
Some people – for economic or ideological reasons – have a more formal desire to reject the science of climate change.
Sea fishermen have an obvious and powerful motive for downplaying the importance of overfishing as a cause of lower catches.
What seems obvious to the rest of us is difficult for them to admit.
We are all fishermen when it comes to facing up to climate change.
Not all scepticism about climate change is attributable to a ‘fisherman effect’ — but we urgently need a more sophisticated typology of scepticism.
Re-framing the terms of the debate and refining our methods of communication will work for some types of scepticism, but not for others.
Without a sensible grasp of the reasons for scepticism, an awful lot of effort could be expended without any discernible effect.
There is a great deal of interest in how to communicate cimate change more effectively.
But how do you go about persuading a fisherman that he needs to catch less fish?
There are way too many people that are trying to use “climate change” as an excuse to reform society regardless of and sometimes even against the will of the majority.
He refers to those wishing to override the “will of the majority” to prevent climate change as purveyors of an “illiberal attitude”.
Yet it is precisely a +fundamental liberal principle+ that personal and minority rights require defence from potential “tyrannies of the majority”.
One might wonder whether the fundamental rights and freedoms of future generations may legitimately be disregarded simply for our own convenience — does this approach have anything to do with “liberal” values?
I am glad you effectively concede that climate-friendly policies are not necessarily or straightforwardly opposed to the will of the public.
On that there appears to be little disagreement.
Relying on “against the will of the majority” in this case is fundamentally flawed when one looks at how effective doubt and fear have been applied to confuse the public who increasingly demonstrate in polls that they don’t believe in the climate science.
True, it’s not easy.
Even those who feel that they’re doing their bit to increase awareness of climate change have proven to fall into acts of sensationalism.
However, it still remains that a social structure that relies on the will of the majority and that majority is easily wooed misinformation is one of inaction and will ultimately not survive.
Yet another scientific scandal has come to light which knocks another whopping crater in the already shattered theory of anthropogenic global warming.
Eight peer-reviewed studies, which for years have played a significant supporting role behind the IPPC’s claims of AGW, have been shown to be fraudulent.
Brighton is renowned for its tolerant atmosphere, which extends to suffering the arrival of the country’s political classes for conference season each autumn.
Yet this year, as an embattled Labour Party met for what is almost certainly its last conference whilst in power, it seemed that even Brighton had grown tired of its guests.
‘Labour is old news in Brighton’ declared a twenty-foot high hoarding for the Greens, cheekily installed on the main route party delegates were taking to the convention hall.
An exhausted-looking Brown, fashioned out of newspaper cuttings, scowled down at the hordes of indifferent daytrippers enjoying the seaside sunshine.
The IPPR’s spin on its latest report – echoed in the media – misleads the public, and potentially damages efforts to mobilise action against climate change.
One of the most basic, but also one of the most important problems in the way people respond to climate change is the so-called “bystander effect”.
This phenomenon, widely noted in the social science literature, concerns the way in which people’s responses are influenced by the responses of those around them, with various experiments demonstrating just how strongly people’s tendencies towards social conformity affect their behaviour.
This even seems to apply in situations as cut-and-dried as simply stating which line on a chart is the longest; or as potentially life-threatening as watching thick smoke begin to pour through the bottom of a doorway.
In the “aggressive abatement” case (450 ppm), the mean “Net present value [NPV] of climate change impacts” is only $410 trillion — or $275 trillion with adaptation.
So stabilizing at 450 …
Safe Climate Australia is a non-government organisation formed and steered by a foundation group of concerned scientists, community and business leaders with a shared understanding of the scientific and moral imperatives for emergency action to restore a safe climate.
Unfortunately, the answer may be: runaway climate change.
As the Climate Safety report points out, the melting of the Arctic summer sea-ice is accelerating beyond even the worst-case predictions of the IPCC, potentially disappearing in the next decade.
As Walt Meier of the National Snow and Ice Data Centre ( NSIDC ) puts it, “for a number of reasons, we’re on …
The Arctic Sea Ice Outlook has just been updated for July.
It’s based on a synthesis of 16 estimates which utilise a range of different projection methods.
They note that there is “no indication that a return to historical levels will occur”.
I recently made an earlier attempt at exploring probability in relation to climate.
The “loading the dice” analogy is becoming popular but it misses something very important: climate change also allows unprecedented (in human history) things to happen.
It is more like painting an extra spot on each face of one of the dice, so that it goes from 2 to 7 instead of 1 to 6.
This increases the odds of rolling 11 or 12, but also makes it possible to roll 13.
Despite this strong evidence for a warming planet, greenhouse gas forcing fails to explain the 2010 heat wave over western Russia.
The natural process of atmospheric blocking, and the climate impacts induced by such blocking, are the principal cause for this heat wave.
It is not known whether, or to what exent, greenhouse gas emissions may affect the frequency or intensity of blocking during summer.
It is important to note that observations reveal no trend in a daily frequency of July blocking over the period since 1948, nor is there an appreciable trend in the absolute values of upper tropospheric summertime heights over western Russia for the period since 1900.
As we learn from our 2010 experience what a sustained heat wave of +5°C to+10°C implies for human health, water resources, and agricultural productivity, a more meaningful appreciation for the potential consequences of the projected climate changes will emerge.
It is clear that the random occurrence of a summertime block in the presence of the projected changes in future surface temperature would produce heat waves materially more severe than the 2010 event.

Climate change deniers have been extremely effective in using the leaked emails from the University of East Anglia and the errors discovered in the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report (IPCC) to confuse the public discussion of climate change and delay mitigation action internationally and in the United States.
They know that they don’t need to win the debate.
Simply keeping it running by maintaining the semblance of ambiguity is sufficient to stave off the legislative action they want to avoid, and which is necessary for stabilizing the climate.
That said, the signs of climate change around the world are undeniable.
The Arctic sea ice is vanishing, species are migrating northward and uphill, the ocean is becoming more acidic, and so on.
In a report commissioned by the Aspen ski resort, it was explained that, in a worst case scenario, the climate of Aspen in 2100 would resemble that of Amarillo, Texas .
Well before that, change will have become so obvious and undeniable that nobody disputing it will be taken seriously.
I think I have worked out where commentator James Delingpole is coming from.
He pretends to be a climate change denier and enemy of environmentalists.
In reality he’s a mole, paid by Greenpeace to inflict as much damage on the anti-green cause as possible.
And he’s doing a marvellous job.
Clippo recently pointed us to Nexus 6 , which led to a bit of a discussion about “the worst climate paper ever”.
What does this have to do with climate change?
Manuel reckons that the heavy, iron-rich core of the sun is “pulled about” by the gravitational effects of the planets, which causes changes to solar output and therefore drives climate change.
This only works, though, because the sun is made of iron – if it really was a ball of Hydrogen and Helium then the climate would not be changing.
Icing on the cake – he actually cites Alexander & Bailey.

The manufactured controversy over emails stolen from the University of East Anglia’s Climatic Research Unit has generated a lot more heat than light over the past two weeks.
The email content being quoted does not indicate that climate data and research have been compromised.

This week an unprecedented 115 world leaders will converge in Copenhagen to forge a global agreement on climate change.
It is thanks to the efforts everyone concerned about climate change that these decision makers will all be in the same room.
However we, together as a global community, need to ensure they make the right decisions.
The bad news is that with only one week left, the international climate negotiations are still deadlocked.
The good news is that this is our opportunity to step things up.
The science is clear, and the technological and social tools to reduce carbon pollution are ready and waiting.
Our movement has the moral high ground.
Now, we must unite and make the moral declaration that nothing short of an equitable science-based treaty is acceptable.
Humanity is hungry for survival.
Today marks the official start of North Atlantic hurricane season.
So...
One of the key differences between genuine climatology and anti-scientific denialism of anthropogenic climate change is the flexibility of the former and the stubbornness of the latter when it comes to our ever-evolving understanding of how the world works.
The connection between hurricanes and climate is a perfect example.
When the "An Inconvenient Truth" crew was filming Al Gore deliver his now-familiar presentation, they couldn't have anticipated that two major hurricanes would, as if on cue, roar through the Gulf of Mexico and inflict some $80 billion in damages to the U.S. coast. From a marketing point of view, the timing was perfect.
When the film was released the next year, a mirror image of Katrina's cloud pattern Photoshopped into the emissions of a smokestack told the whole story as a publicity poster.
Later, Gore added a long series of satellite photos of the recent hurricane activity to his presentation, the one he trained a couple of thousand activists to take to the world.
The scientific basis for linking hurricane activity and global warming was relatively weak in 2005, although at the time, the papers that scientists like Kerry Emanuel were publishing suggested that a warming ocean should increase tropical cyclone intensity, if not frequency.
Emanuel's 2005 Nature pap er that received the most attention concluded that "future warming may lead to an upward trend in tropical cyclone destructive potential.
"
In the two or three years that followed, however, a lot of second guessing was done, and more than a few scientists voiced their doubts about the strength of the link.
The objection was not so much that global warming won't make storms more frequent or powerful, but that we don't really understand enough about how hurricanes form and evolve, or just what the historical record is, to able to state with sufficient confidence just what will happen as the Earth warms.
Chris Landsea, a climatologist who is sometimes falsely included in the tiny list of scientists who reject AGW, wrote in Eos in 2007 a typical summary of the problem:
Researchers cannot assume that the Atlantic tropical cyclone database presents a complete depiction of frequency of events before the advent of satellite imagery in the mid-1960s...
Climate denial bloggers regularly pummeled scientists with accusations that they had overstated the link, turning hurricanes into something of an albatross rather than an icon of global warming.
But of course, those accusations did nothing to affect the actual science, which continued apace.
To someone who only occasionally checks in with the climate journals, it might seem like the pendulum was forever swinging back and forth between alarmism and dismissal.
But to those working inside the field, it was a different story.
the period of the pendulum continues to shorten, and this year we've seen several papers that suggest we might finally be getting a decent idea of what's really going on.
... future projections based on theory and high-resolution dynamical models consistently indicate that greenhouse warming will cause the globally averaged intensity of tropical cyclones to shift towards stronger storms, with intensity increases of 2-11% by 2100.
Existing modelling studies also consistently project decreases in the globally averaged frequency of tropical cyclones, by 6-34%.
Balanced against this, higher resolution modelling studies typically project substantial increases in the frequency of the most intense cyclones, and increases of the order of 20% in the precipitation rate within 100 km of the storm centre.
Just a few weeks ago, Emanuel took another stab at the notion that some climate models were predicting fewer hurricanes, not more.
in a paper delivered to the 29th Conference on Hurricanes and Tropical Meteorology in May, he wrote that those models don't adequately capture the complexities of the interaction between air near the surface of the ocean and stratosphere.
"My results suggest that future warming may lead to an upward trend in tropical cyclone destructive potential, and--taking into account an increasing coastal population -- a substantial increase in hurricane-related losses in the twenty- first century.
lead to an upward trend in tropical cyclone destructive potential.
"
Does all of this mean Al Gore was right to focus so much on hurricanes?
At the time, it can be argued he was getting ahead of the science and maybe that's true.
But the point is, science is willing to admit that conventional wisdom is not perfect.
Given the dearth of hard data five years ago, the best anyone could do was made a rough guess, which is what both Gore and the climatology community were doing.
Given the stake if that guess turns out to be right, is that really such a bad thing?
At worst, you can accuse Gore and perhaps some scientists of not communicating the involved degree of uncertainty well enough.
Compare that with the refusal of many deniers to accept their errors.
For example, no matter how many times you point out that water vapor is not a climate forcing, but a feedback, the argument never seems to go away.
Same with the notion that the world stopped warming in 1998.
The data say otherwise, but it's hard to convince those who haven't bothered to study the facts first.
Are there really 30,000 climatologists who object to the IPCC consensus?
No. But that meme is proving extremely hard to kill.
So, as we begin the 2010 hurricane season, which could be relatively active, it would wise not to jump on every storm as proof of anthropogenic global warming.
But it would be an even bigger mistake not to think about the consequences of more powerful, and perhaps more frequent, hurricanes in the decades ahead.
Are we really comfortable with even a small risk of leaving such a legacy for our offspring?
It is a bit precious to act like alarmists were circumspect and cautious about their claims of an AGW-hurricane link when in reality the claim was trumpeted rather breathlessly by not only Al Gore but many other AGW supporters.
Of course not content to leave it there you reference a statement from a review panel that just says that computer models disagree with each other about whether there "might" be "some" effect on hurricanes "if" the climate were to warm.
You then conclude by undoing all of this by making a completely illogical and emotional appeal to saving future generations of children from what you just stated was an unverifiable increase in hurricanes from AGW.
So I think it's fair to say that he doesn't share your opinions on the subject of a hurricane link or AGW in general.
“I think global warming is real and man-made, at least a lot of it is, and there’s a lot of things to be concerned about.... I do agree there should be an increase in intensity because of global warming.”
A Google search of "Global warming" and "Hurricanes" returns 1,960,000 hits.
The vast majority of them are scare stories or exaggerations based only on the sparse number of studies that support such a link while ignoring the many more that do not.
This scare tactic has been part and parcel of the AGW campaign for many years and was despicably exploited after hurricane Katrina.
In fact, Lance has repeatedly responded to presentations of the peer-accepted empirical facts and descriptions of the physics explained at an elementary level by complaining of their length.
I'm not sure why given I perceive no benefit is yielded employing obvious rhetorical fallacies like the red herring "screed"; especially within a forum of people who are not scientifically illiterate regarding climate change as we encounter in the above quote.

I just carried out the same search, without quotes around the word Hurricanes, and I got 2,190,00 -- the list seems to be growing fast!
However, your statement regarding the content of these links is exactly the reverse of the case.
Here are the first five links I got from Google and relevant quotes from them:
"It is premature to conclude that human activity--and particularly greenhouse warming--has already had a detectable impact on Atlantic hurricane activity.
However, human activity may have already caused substantial changes that are either below the 'detection threshhold' or are not properly modeled yet (e.g., aerosol effects).
"
[Makes no direct statement regarding the question of climate change's effect on hurricanes, just quotes IPCC to the effect that overall precipitation rates will increase.
There is a link to another page asking whether global warming caused Hurricane Katrina, where it states: "although we cannot be certain global warming intensified Katrina per se, it clearly has created circumstances under which powerful storms are more likely to occur at this point in history (and in the future) than they were in the past.
"
"Numerous studies in recent years have found no evidence that the number of hurricanes and their northwest Pacific Ocean cousins, typhoons, is increasing because of the rise in global temperatures.
But a new study in the journal Nature found that hurricanes and typhoons have become stronger and longer-lasting over the past 30 years.
These upswings correlate with a rise in sea surface temperatures.
"
"are storms getting stronger, and if so, what's causing it?
According to a new paper in Nature, the answer is yes — and global warming seems to be the culprit.
Researchers led by James Elsner, a meteorologist at Florida State University, analyzed satellite-derived data of tropical storms since 1981 and found that the maximum wind speeds of the strongest storms have increased significantly in the years since, with the most notable increases found in the North Atlantic and the northern Indian oceans.
They believe that rising ocean temperatures — due to global warming — are one of the main causes behind that change.
"
Why not?
We've already set them up for an inheritance of kilotons of high-level radwaste, persistent toxins in the food chain, collapsing oceanic ecosystems, a severely reduced species count, and at least two generations who will look back on really crappy music for their golden oldies.
The Yale Forum on Climate Change & The Media is grateful for the generous financial support of the Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment and of individual Yale University alumni.
Future historians may regard recent weeks as a momentary breathing spell in the political trajectory of the climate issue.
In the courts, preliminary rulings are awaited on a spate of legal challenges to the Environmental Protection Agency’s finding that greenhouse gases are dangerous and deserve regulation under the Clean Air Act.
In Congress, meanwhile, senators crafting a climate-energy bill different from the cap-and-trade measure passed by the House delayed its unveiling until May 12 so they could regroup after Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina withdrew his support.
This relative lull in the governmental arena followed several tumultuous months of cascading developments - clamor over “Climategate” e-mails, reports of errors by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, polls showing less public worry about climate change, heavy snows in parts of the U.S., and the Copenhagen summit’s lackluster outcome.
Combined, those events produced a sense that the tide might actually be shifting away from something that had seemed all but certain - the launching of forceful and far-reaching federal legislation to combat manmade climate change.
There were various signs that proponents of such action were seeking - perhaps “scrambling” might be more apt - to find new communication strategies, or at least tweak or reshuffle old ones.
Their obvious goal: Reclaim the ability to define the terms of the climate debate, improving the chance to steer its course, especially in Congress.
This rethinking of climate-action forces’ messaging, framing, branding, PR, spin - however the strategic, focused choice of language as a tool of political persuasion is described - has been evident in a couple of key ways.
One is a spreading reluctance to emphasize scientific projections of future climate changes linked to atmospheric warming - even a seeming aversion at times to the word “climate” itself.
This runs parallel to reassessments, reported by The Yale Forum, of how scientists can improve the public explanation of research findings.
Meanwhile, another communication strategy gained greater traction.
This approach highlights other reasons for action to mitigate climate change, stressing that a shift to lower-carbon forms of energy offers linked benefits for the U.S. economy and national security.
In January, for example, pollster Frank Luntz, who previously advised Republicans to stress uncertainties in climate science, presented a communication strategy aimed at passing a climate-energy bill - recommendations that 21 pro-legislation companies in the U.S. Climate Action Partnership paid him to devise.
Luntz’s strategy included de-emphasizing threats to glaciers and polar bears and playing up economic threats from China and India, Reuters reported .
The news service added that Luntz said supporters of the House-passed cap-and-trade bill “have emphasized climate science too much, and the potential positive results from a clean-energy bill - domestic jobs, a healthier environment, and potentially less money sent to the Middle East for oil - too little.”
“It doesn’t matter if there is or isn’t climate change,” Mother Jones reported that Luntz asserted at his strategy’s unveiling.
“It’s still in America’s best interest to develop new sources of energy that are clean, reliable, efficient and safe.” The headline on the story: “The first rule of fighting climate change: Don’t talk about climate change.”
Whether Luntz’s advice was being consciously adopted or not, clear echoes later turned up in pronouncements by various supporters of government action on climate change.
Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat at the heart of efforts to draft a Senate climate-energy measure, told the Associated Press in March, for instance, that the proposal he and colleagues were developing would be “a very different mix of a bill,” compared to the House measure.
“It’s primarily a jobs bill, and an energy independence bill and a pollution reduction-health-clean air bill,” Kerry said.
“Climate sort of follows.
It’s on for the ride.”
Although Kerry said he had no use for “branding,” NPR underscored the importance of that concept in climate message-molding when it reported a month later that “cap and trade” - the very essence of the House bill - had become a “toxic brand” in Congress, so successfully “rebranded” as “cap and tax” by conservative commentators that Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said it had no place in the climate-policy “lexicon.”
“Climate crisis,” with its connotation of extreme urgency, is still part of Al Gore’s lexicon.
The former vice president and campaigner against climate change again used that signature phrase in an op-ed column in The New York Times in February, discussing the controversies surrounding the publication of some scientists’ formerly private e-mails and the subsequent identification of a few errors in the 2007 reports of the IPCC.
Times columnist Thomas Friedman reacted in February to the snowstorm-citing revival of the “hoax” charge against climate science by proposing that the very term “global warming” be avoided.
Friedman’s proposed replacement - “global weirding.” The modified version better conveys scientists’ projections, he argued, “because that is what actually happens as global temperatures rise and the climate changes.
The weather gets weird.”
The Times opinion blogger (and former reporter) Andrew Revkin, in April proposed an alternate to Gore’s slogan.
He said he prefers “energy quest” on his car’s bumper - not because he doubts that a “climate crisis” looms, but because he doesn’t see that as “a productive way to frame this challenge, particularly as defined over the last few years in the heated policy debate.”
With those efforts, critics of government action on climate change sought to re-focus public discussion - once again - as essentially a yes-or-no debate over whether manmade impacts are happening, rather than a debate about what to do about them.
Declaring, for instance, that “the burgeoning Climategate e-mail scandal” had undermined climate science, the Competitive Enterprise Institute last November and December posted tongue-in-cheek YouTube videos, challenging Al Gore to debate Christopher Monckton, an outspoken British critic of climate science.
The message that the science of climate change is fundamentally unsettled was reinforced by state government and corporate entities, some of whom cited news reports about scientists’ stolen e-mails and IPCC errors in their formal challenges of EPA regulation of greenhouse gases.
The office of Texas Republican Governor Rick Perry, for example, claimed in announcing that state’s petition that the IPCC has been “discredited.”
The “science debate” theme, which had generally dwindled in news coverage, began to gain traction again in some media reports.
CNN, for example, presented a program called “Global Warming: Trick or Truth,” on the eve of the Copenhagen summit in December.
Enhancing the suggestion of inconclusive science, opponents of climate action used humor, sometimes bordering on ridicule, to advance the idea that man-made climate change, if it is happening at all, is nothing to worry much about.
One example was the widely-covered Capitol Hill igloo named for Gore, which the family of Senator James Inhofe, the Oklahoma Republican, built in February.
Inhofe himself asserted soon afterward in a Senate hearing that the e-mail controversy showed climate-change science was “far from settled.”
Washington did not provide the only platforms for that message.
At a February fundraiser in Houston for the local Republican Party, a former official auctioning a full-length fur coat asked the audience, “You believe in global warming?” and the collective response was a boisterous “Noooo!”
Increasing attacks on the credibility and integrity of climate science undoubtedly rattled many scientists and those who had used scientific findings to frame arguments for reducing greenhouse emissions.
At first, there were signs of uncertainty about how to respond.
In December - after the disclosure of the scientists’ e-mails and during the Copenhagen summit - a scientist’s blog post reported on a workshop titled “Restarting the Climate Conversation” at the American Geophysical Union’s Fall Meeting.
The blogger, computer science professor Steve Easterbrook of the University of Toronto, thought speakers’ remarks on topics like message-framing were useful, but found the ensuing discussion “rather disappointing.” He wrote:
Seems like everyone recognizes a problem in the huge gulf between what climate scientists themselves say and do, versus how climate science is portrayed in the public discourse.
But nobody (at least among the scientific community) has any constructive ideas for how to fix this problem.
As reports of IPCC errors and heavy snowfalls along the East Coast multiplied in following weeks - a “dismal winter for climate scientists,” the AP’s Seth Borenstein called it - the “problem” cited by Easterbrook seemed to grow larger as the discussion about how to fix it unfolded in sometimes unexpectedly public view.
The longstanding idea that plainer descriptions of research findings are needed was reiterated, as when Jane Lubchenco, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told reporters in March that “scientists have seriously underestimated the importance of explaining what we know about climate in a way people can understand.”
Such a politically-framed message was indeed issued on May 6 with an unquestionably distinguished provenance - a letter in the journal Science, signed by 255 members of the National Academy of Sciences.
The signers denounced “McCarthy-like threats of criminal prosecution against our colleagues on the basis of innuendo and guilt by association.” They further asserted that waiting for “absolute” scientific certainty on climate change “is the same as saying society should never take action.”
At the same time, doubts were being expressed about the wisdom of focusing arguments for such action too much on the science that was the very wellspring of climate-focused policy proposals in the first place.
In a column posted March 10 on Slate.com, Daniel Sarewitz co-director of Arizona State University’s Consortium for Science, Policy, and Outcomes, contended that “contrary to all our modern instincts … political progress on climate change requires not more scientific input into politics, but less.” He added that political gridlock will persist until disputes over values, “hidden” by disputes over climate science, are “flushed out and brought into the sunlight of democratic deliberation.”
Similarly, the writer and climate activist Bill McKibben, wrote on Feb. 25 in The Nation that the ever-larger “mountain” of scientific evidence for manmade climate change was actually easier for opponents of climate-change mitigation to attack, because the growing mass of research invariably includes a few errors.
He added:
A couple of weeks after McKibben’s call for climate messages with populist fervor, the Sierra Club - never a slacker at citing the science of climate change - unveiled just such an attack on Arkansas’ Democratic Senator Blanche Lincoln for her drive to stop EPA regulation of greenhouse gases.
The group labeled Lincoln’s efforts a “Big Oil bailout,” adding that it would “protect the profits of the richest industry in human history - all the while refusing to vote for a comprehensive climate bill that will create thousands of jobs back home.”
One example was the “Veterans for American Power” tour of Operation Free, a coalition of veterans and national security groups.
On the tour, participants said energy-climate legislation would address interwoven concerns including climate change, national security, more energy self-reliance, and cleaner energy.
Operation Free’s blog proudly noted that some of its members took part in the May 12 announcement of the energy-climate bill by Kerry and Senator Joe Lieberman, the Connecticut independent:
“A big part of what they had to say today was about the security impacts of climate change and oil dependence.
In fact, both senators made the point to highlight how oil money enriches unpredictable and unfriendly nations like Iran.”
“American Power Act” obviously conveys the double meaning of domestic energy and national security.
It also conspicuously omits the word “climate,” just as the formal name of the House-passed cap-and-trade bill did - the American Clean Energy and Security Act.
Climate-policy advocates, whether they support or oppose action to stem global warming, increasingly send their messages directly to the public via blogs, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and other social media, while still using old-school tools like ads.
Journalists often have failed to think beyond the bounds that combatants in the climate debate try to set with their message-propagating strategies, says journalist and professor Tom Yulsman.
An associate professor at the University of Colorado’s School of Journalism & Mass Communication and co-director of the Center for Environmental Journalism, Yulsman maintains a lively blog on such issues.
“We should avoid focusing excessively on the ‘yes or no’ framing of climate science (Is it happening?
Are we to blame?
) and pay closer attention to emerging vulnerabilities and impacts in our own communities.
“For example, here in the West we have been in the midst of a decade-long drought that has drained lakes Powell and Mead, the two main storage reservoirs along the Colorado, to about half of their capacities.
“Going forward, how should communities grapple with the likelihood of increasing drought at the same time that demands on water resources will increase as populations rise?
(This issue isn’t unique to the West.
) These issues aren’t far off in the future.
They’re here, right now.
“We should also take a hint from 20 years of climate-policy failure.
There has been no lack of science suggesting the need for action during this time, yet the targets-and-timetables approach embodied by cap-and-trade, the Kyoto Protocol, and the failed effort at Copenhagen have not led to nearly enough action to rein in climate change.
A tiny insect that thrives in warmer temperatures — the coffee berry borer — has been spreading steadily, devastating coffee plants in Africa, Latin America, and around the world
The Arabica coffee grown in Ethiopia and Latin America is an especially climate-sensitive crop.
It requires just the right amount of rain and an average annual temperature between 64 degrees Fahrenheit and 70 degrees Fahrenheit to prosper.
As temperatures rise — Ethiopia's average low temperature has increased by about .66 degrees F every decade since 1951, according to the country's National Meteorological Agency — and rains become more variable, Ethiopian coffee farmers have suffered increasingly poor yields.
Last year was especially bad, with exports dropping by 33 percent.
Some have moved their coffee trees to higher elevations, while others have been forced to switch to livestock and more heat-tolerant crops, such as enset, a starchy root vegetable similar to the plantain.
Now, there is evidence that a warming climate may be linked to one of the major threats facing the coffee industry in Ethiopia and elsewhere: A tiny insect known as the coffee berry borer beetle has been devastating coffee plants around the world, and new research suggests even slight temperature increases promote the spread of the pest.
The beetle is a relatively recent problem in Ethiopia and Latin America, where most Arabica coffee is grown.
A field survey of Ethiopia's coffee-growing regions conducted in the late 1960s found no trace of the beetle, but in 2003 researchers reported that the pest was widespread.
Drought and heavy rains during harvest time may be the prevailing problems for coffee growers in Ethiopia and other countries; but the lack of an effective treatment for the coffee berry borer is cause for concern, especially given new research findings tying the spread of the beetle to rising temperatures.
Until recently, the coffee berry borer was confined to just a few regions in Central Africa.
But since the 1980s, the beetle has gradually spread to every coffee-growing region except Hawaii, Nepal, and Papua New Guinea.
Juliana Jaramillo, a biologist at Kenya's International Center of Insect Physiology and Ecology , suspects temperature increases are to blame.
She and her collaborators recently identified the temperature range in which the beetle can survive.
They found that the average minimum temperature the borer requires to reproduce is about 68 degrees F, and the mountainous regions of Ethiopia did not reach that temperature until 1984.
After establishing the temperature limits of the borer, Jaramillo and her colleagues used climate data to estimate the number of reproductive cycles the beetle could complete annually in four coffee-growing regions.
While Ethiopia was on the low end, with only one to two generations per year, Colombia was one of the highest, supporting up to 4.7 generations of the borer in one year.
Jaramillo believes the discrepancy is largely due to Colombia's year-long growing season.
Coffee plants are most susceptible to pests when they're flowering, so regions that receive rain all year, such as Colombia, are more vulnerable to the borer than those with distinct dry and rainy periods, such as Ethiopia and Kenya.
The coffee berry borer could also be more difficult to control at higher altitudes since moving a pest into a new ecosystem makes its behavior harder to predict.
For example, insects that could serve as natural enemies to the coffee berry borer may not interact with the beetle in the same way at higher elevations.
"Natural enemies can be very useful in pest control, but their cycle has to be in sync with the pest's," said Curtis Petzoldt, a researcher at Cornell University's Integrated Pest Management Program .
Across western North America, huge tracts of forest are dying off at an extraordinary rate, mostly because of outbreaks of insects.
Scientists are now seeing such forest die-offs around the world and are linking them to changes in climate, science journalist Jim Robbins reports.
But shade trees can take years to grow, and while some coffee retailers, including Starbucks, have started promoting shade-grown coffee, it's still the exception rather than the rule.
The notion of sustainable growing practices has also become popular with coffee importers, but these forward-looking efforts, which focus largely on conserving water and reducing carbon emissions, do little to address the climate-related problems that coffee growers are now facing.
Coffee farmers need new strategies to combat threats such as the coffee berry borer, Jaramillo said, and that requires research.
"I think the coffee industry has two options," she said.
"Either they start investing in climate research, or they educate the consumers to drink something else.
"
Now here's another chance for the biotech lobby: don't worry about climate change, just carry on as before but with added value in your drink.
The price goes up either way.
Sod the melting glaciers, floods and hurricanes.
Here at last we have a crisis that will make people take global warming seriously!
"Coffee farmers need new strategies to combat threats such as the coffee berry borer, ..... "I think the coffee industry has two options," she said.
"Either they start investing in climate research, or ......""
For example, insects that could serve as natural enemies to the coffee berry borer may not interact with the beetle in the same way at higher elevations.
Finally, this above story is obviously hooked onto the assumption that it is man's extra co2 that has caused most of the late 20th century warming.
I'm still waiting for evidence of man-made co2 positive feedback overwhelming negative feedback and natural variation in climate cycles.
How is it that this beetle can figure out the world is getting hotter and global warming deniers cannot?
The greatest threat to coffeee production historically has been frost.
South America is currently experiencing record cold temperatures.
Bye bye coffee, or higher prices.
Brazil has also historically used a scheme by which prices were kept high whatever the weather - valorisation?.
These included running the steam trains on coffee - to the refrain " There's an awful lot of coffee in Brasil"- Charlie's Aunt.
I guess we will have to add this beetle to the ever-lengthening list of conspirators in the deniers' great global warming conspiracy theory.
Yesterday saw the launch of a new climate research center in New York City.
The Columbia Climate Center is the offspring of the Earth Institute at Columbia University , itself the brainchild of its founder and director, the influential and prolific economist, Jeffrey Sachs.
The CCC has defined an ambitious mission for itself: to integrate the work of various world-class centers and institutes at Columbia, to develop strategies for mitigation of and adaptation to global climate change, and to communicate the science and best policy thinking to the public and decision makers.
The affiliates of the CCC include such leaders in climate science as NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), led by Jim Hansen, and the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO).
Speaking at the launch yesterday, Sachs said that climate change activists “wouldn’t know what we were doing without the brilliant and painstaking work of scientists.” He noted, for example, the “foresight and prescience” of Wally Broecker , one of the pioneers of climate science and a mainstay at LDEO for nearly 50 years.
(Broecker spoke later, recounting six decades of climate research.
) Sachs said that scientists have been “not only correct, but correct in their worries” and that, at this point, the “uncertainties of science are only of the depth of the risk” we are facing.
Robert Orr, the Assistant Secretary-General of the UN for Strategic Planning and a key advisor on climate change to the SG, cited the conclusions of the recent International Scientific Congress on Climate Change , noting that the IPCC’s AR4 report may now be seen as “quaintly conservative.”
He reminded the large audience that this was a critical year and that even though we are in a global economic downturn, it is imperative to remember that our globalized economies and the many strands of energy and climate change are “deeply intertwined.” Orr cited one of Copenhagen Congress’s key conclusions that “inaction is inexcusable”, but said that having worked with world leaders for several years on this issue, in his view they now have “dramatically increased consciousness”.
The event included a series of presentations by Columbia climate experts.
Among these was one by Richard Seager, an LDEO senior research scientist , who gave us a look at some of the post-AR4 science.
Patrick Kinney , the director of the Mailman School’s Program in Climate and Health , talked about the some of the impacts on health, including how warming will exacerbate smog in the Northeast US.
(Kinney was involved in the landmark Harvard Six Cities Air Pollution and Health Study .
) As I noted above, the old lion, Wally Broecker, wound up the proceedings with a short but interesting overview of some of the key climate science work of the past 60 years.
A highlight of the event was the discussion between Sachs and entrepreneur and philanthropist Ted Turner on how to address climate change, and the importance of the media.
Turner created the United Nations Foundation as well as the media empire that includes CNN, which Sachs said ‘invented the global news system’.
Turner called for “a renaissance, a new burst of knowledge”, while Sachs lamented the intransigence of the Wall St. Journal on climate change.
They agreed that Turner would talk to Rupert Murdoch about that and straighten him out.
The webcast of Sachs’s remarks and his entertaining conversation with Turner is well worth watching.

Unfortunately, the answer may be: runaway climate change.
As the Climate Safety report points out, the melting of the Arctic summer sea-ice is accelerating beyond even the worst-case predictions of the IPCC, potentially disappearing in the next decade.
As Walt Meier of the National Snow and Ice Data Centre ( NSIDC ) puts it, “for a number of reasons, we’re on a fast track”.
Unfortunately, however, “what happens in the Arctic actually doesn’t stay in the Arctic”.
The sea-ice is in essence a keystone in the global climate system: as this keystone crumbles and falls away, the other bricks start to fall inwards, ultimately collapsing the entire structure – or, in this case, causing climate change to spiral out of our control.
As reflective white ice is replaced with absorbent open ocean, more heat is taken up by the surrounding region (and thus by the global climate system as a whole).
This places greater pressure on the Greenland ice-sheet, leading to greater sea-level rise; and causes permafrost and sub-oceanic methane deposits in these northern latitudes to melt, potentially releasing a vast quantity of greenhouse gases as a result.
Bringing all greenhouse gas emissions to a halt will of course be absolutely essential in retaining a safe climate – at present, indeed, it is the most significant step the global community can take.
But because of the dynamic that has been set in motion in the Arctic, the melting of the sea-ice is set to continue whether or not these emissions are halted.
The reason for this is fairly simple: the earth is warmed by atmospheric concentrations – the “blanket” of greenhouse gases currently in the atmosphere – not by emissions, which merely thicken that blanket over time.
Atmospheric carbon is re-absorbed into the biosphere over time, of course, by trees, oceans, and other processes – but as a recent paper from the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggests, this process will be occurring at roughly the same rate as heat currently absorbed by the ocean is transferred into the atmosphere.
For this reason, the heating caused by the gases emitted today is effectively irreversible for the next few thousand years.
More worryingly, greenhouse gas emissions are linked to the emissions of aerosols, tiny atmospheric particles that deflect incoming solar radiation, and which have thus provided a cooling effect, masking the heating we would otherwise have received.
Unfortunately, it takes only a very short period of time for these particles to be washed out of the atmosphere – thus, as the “heat shield” masking the warming of the planet is removed, while the blanket of greenhouse gases remains, we can expect to experience a significant “pulse” of warming.
Even more worryingly, major uncertainties remain as to just how effective this shield has been in dampening down the warming effect so far – if its effect has been strong enough, with decarbonisation (which will have the ancillary effect of removing the shield), we could cause a sudden temperature rise, at an unprecedented rate and intensity.
We have been fortunate enough to enjoy two significant “lags” in the climate system’s response to human activity – the “thermal inertia” of the world’s oceans, and the masking effect of aerosols emitted alongside our greenhouse gases – which we might not be able to enjoy for much longer.
Along with the sheer political inertia that has stalled action globally, it is these troubling signs above all that are making scientists consider the possibility of geo-engineering – large-scale schemes to draw down carbon from the atmosphere, and to actively cool the earth.
On the one hand, geo-engineering as an alternative to decarbonising human activities is unconscionable, not least as climate change is not the only carbon-related problem: the absorption of carbon by the ocean turns it to acid, destroying the species that form the base of the marine food chain.
On the other, in light of the most recent climate science, it appears that in terms of the level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, we are already in the danger zone: climate change is set to spiral out of our control even with the complete cessation of all our greenhouse gas emissions.
This unpleasant reality has two significant implications.
Firstly, reducing the risk of runaway climate change is likely to mean mopping up some of the excess greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
Secondly, we must prepare for the worst.
If the most extreme predictions of scientists are realised, and the arctic experiences an extremely rapid decline – particularly as levels of atmospheric aerosols dissipate – the vicious spiral of extra heating and further release of greenhouse gases could quickly make a return to a safe climate impossible to achieve.
If that is the case, we may well need a crash programme of research into ways of actively cooling the planet.
Climate change poses a global challenge and India must play a dual role in responding to the challenge as a responsible member of the international community and in its own interest.
There are two dimensions in the response to global warming- mitigation and adaptation.
climate change.
The universally accepted UN Framework on Climate change provides for global cooperation in this endeavour on the basis of the principle of ”common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities” of each party.
India must continue to fulfill its commitments under the convention by adopting development policies and measures that generate significant mitigation co-benefits at no incremental cost.
By identifying and implementing such “win-win” measures, we can pursue mitigation objectives without diverting resources from economic and social development priorities, including environmental priorities related to clean air, water and sanitation.
Adaptation: Since climate change is now an inevitable prospect, we must also consider how best to adapt it, so as to minimize its harmful consequences.
Improved physical infrastructure can afford some protection against phenomenon associated with climate change such as floods, extreme weather events or coastal erosion.
A switch to new crops, seeds or agricultural practices can moderate the impacts on agriculture of changes in temperature and water availability.
Education, training and rural extension services can facilitate adaptation efforts.
Improved weather and flood forecasting and better communications can assist evacuation, relief and rehabilitation.
As a developing country, India’s primary effort must be in the area of adaptation.
The agricultural sector- which is the major source of employment in India and most other developing countries- is directly vulnerable to changes in temperature, rainfall patterns and water availability to a much greater degree than the industrial or services sectors.
Moreover, developing countries lack sufficient financial and technological resources for adapting successfully to climate change.
This imposes major constraints on their ability to build the physical infrastructure required to cope with floods or extreme weather events, or to adopt new capital intensive agricultural practices such as drip irrigation, or to switch over to new non-agricultural occupations.
For a developing country, rapid economic and social development is an essential requirement for successful long-term adaptation to climate change.
Development is the best form of adaptation.
For example, in the agriculture sector, a wide variety of adaptive actions are being taken to lessen or overcome adverse effects of climate change on agriculture.
At the level of farms, adjustments may include the introduction of later- maturing crop varieties or species, switching cropping sequences, sowing earlier, adjusting timing of field operations, conserving soil moisture through right tillage methods, and improving irrigation efficiency.
Some options such as switching crop varieties may be inexpensive while others, such as introducing irrigation (especially high-efficiency, water-conserving technologies), involve heavy expenditure.
Adaptation is specific to each type of natural ecosystem.
Mitigation of climate change refers to measures that reduce emissions through improved efficiency of energy use, reduced deforestation, a switch to non-fossil fuels, or capture of emissions underground and in oceans, vegetation and soils.
The two responses are not necessarily independent of each other.
Increased use of air conditioning in order to adapt to higher temperatures, for example, may increase GHG emissions to the extent that electricity is generated using fossil fuels.
Planting trees to absorb atmospheric carbon is another mitigation option, but the measure will not be as effective if trees are planted in an area where global warming is likely to raise temperatures and reduce precipitation.
Which countries should undertake these options and to what extent?
Much of the carbon dioxide emissions during the industrial era have arisen from the use of fossil fuels in the industrialized countries.
These countries have benefited from the use of relatively inexpensive fossil fuels in enlarging their economies and achieving a high standard of living.
On this basis, the industrialized countries need to assume leadership to reduce their own emissions and also assist developing countries such as India in reducing their emissions.
Countries of the European Union, Japan and Canada have committed to reduce their emissions of six GHGs by about 7.5% under the Kyoto Protocol compared to their 1990 levels.
The U.S and Australia have assumed no mandatory commitments.
The future is, however, different.
As a group, the economies of developing countries and their fossil fuels consumption is growing faster than that of the more mature industrialized economies.
China’s and India’s emissions will surpass those of the U.S today by 2010 and 2035 respectively.
Faster growth means that capital stock is turning over faster, which offers a golden opportunity to plant seeds of low-emissions technologies whose impact will be felt for decades to come.
Some adaptation and mitigation measures are being undertaken by countries already for reasons that have little to do with climate change.
These are known as no-regrets measures because their benefits exceed their cost to society, excluding the benefits of avoided climate change.
Most energy-efficiency measures fall in this category of mitigation options.
Reducing local air pollution through the use of technology that improves combustion and reduces fuel use would also constitute a no-regrets option since it would reduce GHG emissions at no additional cost.
Developing software to predict and implement measures to reduce coastal storm surges is an adaptation option that could be used to predict surges that mey be exacerbated by global warming.
Some adaptation is occurring now, to observed and projected future climate change, but on a limited basis.
A wide array of adaptation options is available, but more extensive adaptation than is currently occurring is required to reduce vulnerability to future climate change.
There are barriers, limits and costs, but these are not fully understood.
Vulnerability to climate change can be exacerbated by the presence of other stresses.
A portfolio of adaptation and mitigation measures can diminish the risks associated with climate change.
Afforestation; reforestation; forest management; reduced deforestation; harvested wood product management; use of forestry products for bioenergy to replace fossil fuel use
Landfill methane recovery; waste incineration with energy recovery; composting of organic waste; controlled waste water treatment; recycling and waste minimization
Currently, a few errors –and supposed errors– in the last IPCC report (“AR4″) are making the media rounds – together with a lot of distortion and professional spin by parties interested in discrediting climate science.
Time for us to sort the wheat from the chaff: which of these putative errors are real, and which not?
And what does it all mean, for the IPCC in particular, and for climate science more broadly?
Working Group 1 (WG1), which deals with the physical climate science basis, as assessed by the climatologists, including several of the Realclimate authors.
Working Group 3 (WG3) , which deals with mitigation options for limiting global warming, as assessed by energy experts, economists, etc.
Himalayan glaciers: In a regional chapter on Asia in Volume 2, written by authors from the region, it was erroneously stated that 80% of Himalayan glacier area would very likely be gone by 2035.
This is of course not the proper IPCC projection of future glacier decline, which is found in Volume 1 of the report.
There we find a 45-page, perfectly valid chapter on glaciers, snow and ice ( Chapter 4 ), with the authors including leading glacier experts (such as our colleague Georg Kaser from Austria, who first discovered the Himalaya error in the WG2 report).
There are also several pages on future glacier decline in Chapter 10 (“Global Climate Projections”), where the proper projections are used e.g.
to estimate future sea level rise.
So the problem here is not that the IPCC’s glacier experts made an incorrect prediction.
The problem is that a WG2 chapter, instead of relying on the proper IPCC projections from their WG1 colleagues, cited an unreliable outside source in one place.
Fixing this error involves deleting two sentences on page 493 of the WG2 report .
Sea level in the Netherlands: The WG2 report states that “The Netherlands is an example of a country highly susceptible to both sea-level rise and river flooding because 55% of its territory is below sea level”.
This sentence was provided by a Dutch government agency – the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, which has now published a correction stating that the sentence should have read “55 per cent of the Netherlands is at risk of flooding; 26 per cent of the country is below sea level, and 29 per cent is susceptible to river flooding”.
It surely will go down as one of the more ironic episodes in its history when the Dutch parliament last Monday derided the IPCC, in a heated debate, for printing information provided by … the Dutch government.
In addition, the IPCC notes that there are several definitions of the area below sea level.
The Dutch Ministry of Transport uses the figure 60% (below high water level during storms), while others use 30% (below mean sea level).
Needless to say, the actual number mentioned in the report has no bearing on any IPCC conclusions and has nothing to do with climate science, and it is questionable whether it should even be counted as an IPCC error.
African crop yields: The IPCC Synthesis Report states: “By 2020, in some countries, yields from rain-fed agriculture could be reduced by up to 50%.” This is properly referenced back to chapter 9.4 of WG2, which says: “In other countries, additional risks that could be exacerbated by climate change include greater erosion, deficiencies in yields from rain-fed agriculture of up to 50% during the 2000-2020 period, and reductions in crop growth period (Agoumi, 2003).” The Agoumi reference is correct and reported correctly.
The Sunday Times, in an article by Jonathan Leake, labels this issue “Africagate” – the main criticism being that Agoumi (2003) is not a peer-reviewed study (see below for our comments on “gray” literature), but a report from the International Institute for Sustainable Development and the Climate Change Knowledge Network, funded by the US Agency for International Development.
The report, written by Morroccan climate expert Professor Ali Agoumi, is a summary of technical studies and research conducted to inform Initial National Communications from three countries (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and is a perfectly legitimate IPCC reference.
It is noteworthy that chapter 9.4 continues with “However, there is the possibility that adaptation could reduce these negative effects (Benhin, 2006).” Some examples thereof follow, and then it states: “However, not all changes in climate and climate variability will be negative, as agriculture and the growing seasons in certain areas (for example, parts of the Ethiopian highlands and parts of southern Africa such as Mozambique), may lengthen under climate change, due to a combination of increased temperature and rainfall changes (Thornton et al., 2006).
Mild climate scenarios project further benefits across African croplands for irrigated and, especially, dryland farms.” (Incidentally, the Benhin and Thornton references are also “gray”, but nobody has complained about them.
Could there be double standards amongst the IPCC’s critics?
)
Chapter 9.4 to us sounds like a balanced discussion of potential risks and benefits, based on the evidence available at the time–hardly the stuff for shrill “Africagate!” cries.
If the IPCC can be criticized here, it is that in condensing these results for its Synthesis Report, important nuance and qualification were lost – especially the point that the risk of drought (defined as a 50% downturn in rainfall) “could be exacerbated by climate change”, as chapter 9.4 wrote – rather than being outright caused by climate change.
Trends in disaster losses: Jonathan Leake (again) in The Sunday Times accused the IPCC of wrongly linking global warming to natural disasters.
The IPCC in a statement points out errors in Leake’s “misleading and baseless story”, and maintains that the IPCC provided “a balanced treatment of a complicated and important issue”.
While we agree with the IPCC here, WG2 did include a debatable graph provided by Robert Muir-Wood (although not in the main report but only as Supplementary Material).
It cited a paper by Muir-Wood as its source although that paper doesn’t include the graph, only the analysis that it is based on.
Muir-Wood himself has gone on record to say that the IPCC has fairly represented his research findings and that it was appropriate to include them in the report.
In our view there is no IPCC error here; at best there is a difference of opinion.
Obviously, not every scientist will always agree with assessments made by the IPCC author teams.
Amazon forest dieback: Leake (yet again) , with “research” by skeptic Richard North, has also promoted “Amazongate” with a story regarding a WG2 statement on the future of Amazonian forests under a drying climate.
The contested IPCC statement reads: “Up to 40% of the Amazonian forests could react drastically to even a slight reduction in precipitation; this means that the tropical vegetation, hydrology and climate system in South America could change very rapidly to another steady state, not necessarily producing gradual changes between the current and the future situation (Rowell and Moore, 2000).” Leake’s problem is with the Rowell and Moore reference, a WWF report.
The roots of the story are in two blog pieces by North, in which he first claims that the IPCC assertions attributed to the WWF report are not actually in that report.
Since this claim was immediately shown to be false, North then argued that the WWF report’s basis for their statement (a 1999 Nature article by Nepstad et al.
) dealt only with the effects of logging and fire –not drought– on Amazonian forests.
To these various claims Nepstad has now responded , noting that the IPCC statement is in fact correct.
The only issue is that the IPCC cited the WWF report rather than the underlying peer-reviewed papers by Nepstad et al.
These studies actually provide the basis for the IPCC’s estimate on Amazonian sensitivity to drought.
Investigations of the correspondence between Leake, scientists, and a BBC reporter (see here and here and here ) show that Leake ignored or misrepresented explanatory information given to him by Nepstad and another expert, Simon Lewis, and published his incorrect story anyway.
This “issue” is thus completely without merit.
One near-universal meme of the media stories on the Himalaya mistake was that this was “one of the most central predictions of the IPCC” – apparently in order to make the error look more serious than it was.
However, this prediction does not appear in any of the IPCC Summaries for Policy Makers, nor in the Synthesis Report (which at least partly explains why it went unnoticed for years).
None of the media reports that we saw properly explained that Volume 1 (which is where projections of physical climate changes belong) has an extensive and entirely valid discussion of glacier loss.
In some media reports the impression has been given that even the fundamental results of climate change science are now in question, such as whether humans are in fact changing the climate, causing glacier melt, sea level rise and so on.
The IPCC does not carry out primary research, and hence any mistakes in the IPCC reports do not imply that any climate research itself is wrong.
A reference to a poor report or an editorial lapse by IPCC authors obviously does not undermine climate science.
Doubting basic results of climate science based on the recent claims against the IPCC is particularly ironic since none of the real or supposed errors being discussed are even in the Working Group 1 report, where the climate science basis is laid out.
To be fair to our colleagues from WG2 and WG3, climate scientists do have a much simpler task.
The system we study is ruled by the well-known laws of physics, there is plenty of hard data and peer-reviewed studies, and the science is relatively mature.
The greenhouse effect was discovered in 1824 by Fourier, the heat trapping properties of CO2 and other gases were first measured by Tyndall in 1859, the climate sensitivity to CO2 was first computed in 1896 by Arrhenius, and by the 1950s the scientific foundations were pretty much understood.
Do the above issues suggest “politicized science”, deliberate deceptions or a tendency towards alarmism on the part of IPCC?
We do not think there is any factual basis for such allegations.
To the contrary, large groups of (inherently cautious) scientists attempting to reach a consensus in a societally important collaborative document is a prescription for reaching generally “conservative” conclusions.
And indeed, before the recent media flash broke out, the real discussion amongst experts was about the AR4 having underestimated, not exaggerated, certain aspects of climate change.
These include such important topics as sea level rise and sea ice decline (see the sea ice and sea level chapters of the Copenhagen Diagnosis ), where the data show that things are changing faster than the IPCC expected.
Overall then, the IPCC assessment reports reflect the state of scientific knowledge very well.
There have been a few isolated errors, and these have been acknowledged and corrected.
What is seriously amiss is something else: the public perception of the IPCC, and of climate science in general, has been massively distorted by the recent media storm.
All of these various “gates” – Climategate, Amazongate, Seagate, Africagate, etc., do not represent scandals of the IPCC or of climate science.
Rather, they are the embarrassing battle-cries of a media scandal, in which a few journalists have misled the public with grossly overblown or entirely fabricated pseudogates, and many others have naively and willingly followed along without seeing through the scam.
It is not up to us as climate scientists to clear up this mess – it is up to the media world itself to put this right again, e.g.
by publishing proper analysis pieces like the one of Tim Holmes and by issuing formal corrections of their mistaken reporting.
We will follow with great interest whether the media world has the professional and moral integrity to correct its own errors.
PS.
A new book by Realclimate-authors David Archer and Stefan Rahmstorf critically discussing the main findings of the AR4 (all three volumes) is just out: The Climate Crisis .
None of the real or alleged errors are in this book, since none of those contentious statements plucked from the thousands of pages appeared to be “main findings” that needed to be discussed in a 250-page summary.
PPS.
Same thing for Mike’s book Dire Predictions: Understanding Global Warming , which bills itself as “The illustrated guide to the findings of the IPCC”.
Or Gavin’s “ Climate Change: Picturing the Science ” – which does include a few pictures of disappearing glaciers though!
[Response: Maybe on a different planet.
There is more data than you can poke a stick at, millions of lines of code in the public domain, and climate scientists tripping over themselves to do outreach at schools, churches, clubs, museums, TV, radio and music hall.
I'm collecting 'we surrender' emails from the sceptics as we speak.... - gavin]
This is all very thorough and scholarly.
However, you do not respond to Sen Inhofe’s recent comment that we aren’t changing the climate because “God’s still up there”.
Is it or is it not that case that the author’s of the IPCC reports have systematically conspired to silence intelligent climate science and the divine negative feedback theory?
The issue of divine negative feedback is simply not addressed anywhere in the reports.
How do you respond to godwillfixitgate?
(1) Is there any doubt that the majority of glaciers around the world are retreating and that such retreats are having, and are going to increasingly have, detrimental effects on water supplies of communities, and even countries, relying on them?
Like everything else, there can be reasonable debates about the speed at which different glaciers are retreating depending on local conditions.
But even the Chinese, normally the last people to have any concerns about environmental issues, are concerned about the Himalayan glaciers that affect their water supplies.
I don’t know when the Himalyan glaciers are going to be gone, but whether the year is 2035 or 2350 or somewhere in between, the issue is surely that if such a prospect is on the cards we need to do something about it, not argue about the precise time that the last cube of ice disappears from the last mountain top.
(3) “Only” a quarter of the Netherlands and only a half susceptible to flooding?
Well, that’s all right then.
No need for the Dutch to panic, no need for little boys to put fingers in dykes just yet.
And what about the figures for Bangladesh?
The Pacific Islands?
Major coastal cities around the world?
Any problems anyone can see as sea levels rise?
No, because we need to debate whether a half or “only” a quarter of a major industrial nation is going to be flooded in a timespan which will mean it will be seen by people now alive.
Babies and bathwater anyone?
This is great information!
I’ll be making a presentation on the most basic aspects of climate science and economics in two months and expect that there will be serious skeptics in the audience who have bought into the media misinformation.
What about the biassed and unsubstantiated ways in which biofuels were written up including in the WG3 volume, including the Summary for Policymakers, which 5 name scientists (unconnected to ‘climate scepticism’) complained about?
See http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2010/01/the-ipcc-is-not-infallible-shock/#comment-155614 – I responded subsequently to several responses to this.
[Response: You have to get past the appalling spin put on them by the Mail first.
The actual statements are online at the BBC .
There is absolutely nothing new here unless you've actually fallen for the strawman caricature of what climate scientists are supposed to have been saying.
- gavin]
[Response: Thanks for this link, Gavin.
I think a big problem with this BBC interview is the implicit undercurrent - never stated explicitly - that the recent warming is anthropogenic if it is unprecedented.
Scientifically, these two things have nothing to do with each other, as we have discussed in more detail here .
We know recent warming is anthropogenic because we know what is causing the recent increase in radiative forcing - in other words, we know the source of the heat.
It is the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, caused by our emissions.

The IPCC was established in an age of less pressing urgency.
To take 3 years to author a near perfect report is a luxury that we can no longer afford.
We now enter an age where climate destabilization events may be much more sudden; Pine Island WAIS, increasing permafrost melting and methane release may be catastrophic within a 3 year timeline.
Any speed up of information flow is warranted.
I assume that’s sarcasm?
Or perhaps just a rose-tinted view of the UK press?
Granted, we don’t have quite the equivalent of Fox News over here, but our broadsheet newspapers often rival the tabloids in their lack of concern with facts.
First, the IPCC by its very existence as a clearing house of information on climate change provides a single target on which denialists and spinmeisters can focus.
Since it is the primary information source for most reality-based policy makers, it does not matter that the information it is providing is in fact not primary.
As long as they can make the IPCC look bad, they can give the impression of making climate scienc look bad.
Note the contrast here to the evolution debate where creationists have no single target on which they can focus.
Second, the important role of the IPCC is entirely out of proportion to its tiny resources and staff.
In this sense it is a mirror of its parent orgatization–the UN, which is also a favorite whipping boy for rightwing bullies and conspiracy theorists.
In the debate over smoking, the source of anti-smoking information was the government.
And while the anti-smoking denialists could fight a delaying action, the Surgeon General and the government behind him had the resources to hit back if the attacks and lies became too egregious.
In some ways, it is interesting to watch the resulting clustercluck.
I am curious how people will react when the orgy of denial is spent and they realize that there is even more evidence telling them they are warming the planet to dangerous levels than there was before.
We are probing the limits of human denial as well as the secrets of the planet’s climate.
So, how does any of this put the IPCC or climate science in jeopardy?
Add to that the fact that none of the errors are central to the major ideas of climate science.
Perhaps you’ll comment on the fact that the BBC is highly invested in climate change, via their pension, and therefore, with billions riding on their investments, are equally as likely to spin climate science in their favor?
“The UN body that advises world leaders on climate change must investigate an apparent bias in its report that resulted in several exaggerations of the impact of global warming, according to its former chairman.
In an interview with The Times Robert Watson said that all the errors exposed so far in the report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) resulted in overstatements of the severity of the problem.”
I can’t overemphasize how important postings like this and websites like this are in the climate change debate.
The news media does a terrible job in interpreting scientific information and it is easily manipulated into producing very inaccurate reporting.
And without a personal background in the scientific specialties under study, it’s hard for any individual to know what importance to give some of these hyped-up stories.
So thanks to Real Climate and its contributors for providing the proper context.
You say, “It is not up to us as climate scientists to clear up this mess – it is up to the media world itself to put this right again.” But if one thing’s clear from all this it’s that if you leave it to the media this just won’t happen.
I understand your reluctance – but I’m afraid if anything’s to be done about it, climate scientists are going to have to take the initiative.
As a matter of urgency, funding needs to be found for a rebuttal agency which can pounce on these errors as soon as they come up.
It needs to involve both people with professional experience of getting stories into the media and scientists who have the time to give the issues their full and immediate attention (perhaps scientists who have retired from full-time research).
Absurd that such a thing is needed, of course, but without it the denialists will continue to run rings around you.
The charges of FOI violations against CRU are also starting to look ephemeral.
Remarkably (or not depending on one’s POV), nobody in the media seems to have thought it worth their time to follow up on the details even though so many of them, including “responsible” reporters, were happy to repeat the charges.
In particular, it shouldn’t be forgotten that it was Andy Revkin, a leading climate reporter working for the U.S. “newspaper of record,” who legitimated “CRU-gate” by writing a story that appeared on the front page of the New York Times.
To all appearances *nothing* has been learned from the execrable example set by the NYT in the run-up to the Iraq War.
“What is seriously amiss is something else: the public perception of the IPCC, and of climate science in general, has been massively distorted by the recent media storm.
All of these various “gates” – Climategate, Amazongate, Seagate, Africagate, etc., do not represent scandals of the IPCC or of climate science.
Rather, they are the embarrassing battle-cries of a media scandal, in which a few journalists have misled the public with grossly overblown or entirely fabricated pseudogates, and many others have naively and willingly followed along without seeing through the scam.
It is not up to us as climate scientists to clear up this mess – it is up to the media world itself to put this right again”
I know this may be a little off-topic, but the media’s reporting on Climate Change, especially the ‘many others have naively and willingly followed along without seeing through the scam’, highlights a certain pattern in the behaviour of the mainstream media which is the subject of an excellent book by Noam Chomsky and Edward S. Herman, ‘Manufacturing Consent’.
I urge you guys at Realclimate, if you have the time (which I know you’re short on), to read it.
>”Perhaps you’ll comment on the fact that the BBC is highly invested in climate change, via their pension, and therefore, with billions riding on their investments, are equally as likely to spin climate science in their favor?”.<
As long as there’s a big, heated debate over climate change, the traditional media benefits.
They’re under such incredible economic pressure that they’re grasping for anything to capture more eyeballs, so at least some of them are happy to assume the position of arms merchant in this war of words.
“…climate scientists are going to have to take the initiative.”
Please look where we are today, with climate scientists taking the ‘initiative’.
When the situation calls for a cool-headed detached approach, you are asking for more initiative?
Recently, I have been trying to determine the “physical climate science basis” for the effect of clouds on radiation balance.
In particular, is their feedback/forcing positive or negative?
The clearest reference I have found so far is Ramanathan’s 1987 Physics Today article.
There he identified quantification of cloud effects on climate as a key technical problem.
Did you ever “solve” it?
Of course the climate will change, we all know that.
It’s your focus on CO2 that’s at issue.
To make your case against carbon you need accessible answers to questions like mine about cloud effects.
In a comparison of models, the cloud feedback was positive in all, but the magnitude varied greatly.
Thus, cloud feedback is still considered the greatest uncertainty in climate-change projections for a given emissions scenario.
In other words, models that predict the most warming are those that have the most positive cloud feedback.
Note, however, that substantial warming is projected even in models with a small cloud feedback.
I do recommend reading “The Discovery of Global Warming” by Spencer Weart, first link under the science section of the sidebar.
While I would hesitate to recommend a permanent organization to answer the spin, I do think it is clear that a climate-education branch of the IPCC might be a useful addition to the effort.
It is clear that the task of the IPCC has grown well beyond its capabilities.
The organization probably needs to grow as well.
One effective (and under utilized) argument against this line of attack is to point out that no professional organization that has adopted a position statement on climate change has dissented from the consensus view of climate scientist.
Even the frigging American Association of Petroleum Geologists is neutral on the consensus–and if ever there was a group with an axe to grind, that would be it!
As a scientist who does not work in climate science, my life and research are likely to be directly and negatively impacted by the fact that we are warming the planet.
In all likelihood, it means the latter half of my career will be spent working on satellites directed at understanding climate rather than the diverse range of space telescopes and satellites I’ve worked on to date.
Likewise, physicists, chemists, meteorologists, geophysicists, geologists, and on and on will likely be negatively impacted in terms of funding, research opportunities, etc.
And yet, the professional societies representing these fields have all taken positions that say climate change is a serious problem that needs to be addressed.
That level of consensus is truly unprecedented.
I have to wonder why we don’t hear about it more often.
WGI reviews and synthesises all the work on the physics and chemistry of the Earth system and tries to make projections of how things like temperature, rainfall and atmospheric circulation will change in the future.
I refer to this report a lot in my work as a meteorologist/climatologist.
I know a little about Working Group II – as well as climatologists, it is written by hydrologists, glaciologists, economists, social scientists and medical scientists and considers the potential impacts of climate change.
As we said above, WGII is relatively speculative by nature.
In this context, was Glaciergate a reviewing error rather than an attempt to distort the science?
Well, one of the reviewers for this section (Dr. Hayley Fowler from the University of Newcastle, see here for the reviewer comments for WGII Chapter 10) actually picked up the unjustified “2035” claim and suggested some proper peer reviewed papers to improve the relevant section.
The report author’s response to Dr. Fowler’s comment was: “unable to get hold of the suggested references”.
This response is clearly not adequate but it is more than conceivable that one of many suggested revisions was missed rather than ignored deliberately to overstate the impact of a changing climate.
Indeed, this is the first questioning of anything in the IPCC report that I can remember since it was published in 2007 – that says a lot for the usual skill and thoroughness of the report reviewers, despite the failure in this one case, and suggests that there wasn’t a systematic effort to exaggerate climate impacts.
Most importantly, though, the WGII glacier claim changes absolutely nothing about the fundamental science behind climate change that appears in WGI.
To dismiss the IPCC because of Glaciergate is like saying you wont trust anything in The Times newspaper because they once printed a football result wrong.
The WGI science is all robust and, if anything, quite conservative in its claims and projections.
Anyway, if you’re looking for people with in depth knowledge of specific fields, then there are the WG Chairs.
For example, WGI was chaired by Susan Solomon , who stands a pretty good chance of being awarded a Nobel prize for her work in the 1980s on the ozone “hole”.
Beneath the WG Chairs, each chapter has at least 1 co-ordinating author and 1 lead author.
Beneath them, each chapter also has many contributing authors, all experts in their field.
Their work is all reviewed by other experts.
“The revelation is the latest crack to appear in the scientific consensus over climate change”
This claim was made in the Times article, with the other cited cracks being the CRU email theft and something about sea level rise estimates.
This claim seems to assume that “consensus” means that no new work is going on in the climate sciences or at least demonstrates a complete ignorance of how science works.
Things will change in the science, which is exactly why the plans for the next IPCC report (due in 2014) are already well under way.
These are exciting (and, if I’m honest, a little depressing) times for climate science so its disappointing that many people outside the research community don’t want to know about it!

Future projections by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
According to a report by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC), 30% of animal and plant species will be vulnerable to extinction if global temperatures rose by 1.5 to 2.5 degrees Celsius.
It says the world’s have-nots would be worst hit by climate change, predicting greenhouse gases would change rainfall patterns, intensify tropical storms, accelerate the melting of Arctic ice and mountain glaciers, and amplify the risk of drought, flooding and water stress.
IPCC holds that Asia faces a heightened risk of flooding, severe water shortages, infectious disease and hunger from global warming this century.
The region is confronted by a 90% likelihood that more than a billion of its people will be “adversely affected” by the impacts of global warming by the 2050s.
Its estimates say the magnitude of climate-change effects will vary according to the size of the world’s population, energy use and the level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
But under any scenario, the world’s most populous region will be badly hit.
Increases in the frequency of droughts and floods are projected to affect local crop production negatively, especially in subsistence sectors at low latitudes.
Even modest rises in sea levels will cause flooding and economic disruption in densly-populated mega-deltas, such as the mouths of the Yangtze in China, the Red River in China and Vietnam, and the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta in low-lying Bangladesh.
Coasts are projected to be exposed to increasing risks, including coastal erosion, due to climate change and sea-level rise.
The effect will be exacerbated by increasing human-induced pressures on coastal areas.
Many millions more people are projected to be flooded every year due to sea level rise by the 2080s.
Those densly populated and low-lying areas where adaptive capacity is relatively low, and which already face other challenges such as tropical storms or local coastal subsidence, are especially at risk.
The numbers affected will be largest in the mega-deltas of Asia and Africa while small islands are especially vulnerable.
The most vulnerable industries, settlements and societies are generally those in coastal and river flood plains, those whose economies are closely linked with climate-sensitive resources, and those in areas prone to extreme weather events, especially where rapid urbanization is occurring.
Poor communities can be especially vulnerable, in particular those concentrated in high-risk areas.
They tend to have more limited adaptive capacities, and are more dependent on climate-sensitive resources such as local water and food supplies.
Projected climate change-related exposures are likely to affect the health status of millions of people, particularly those with low adaptive capacity, through
b. increased deaths, disease and injury due to heat waves, floods, storms, fires and droughts;
d. the increased frequency of cardio-respiratory diseases due to higher concentrations of ground level ozone related to climate change; and,
Cholera and malaria could increase due to flooding and a wider habitat range for mosquitoes.
Climate change is expected to have some mixed effects, such as the decrease or increase of the range and transmission potential of malaria in Africa.
Studies in temperate areas(mainly in industrialized countries) have shown that climate change is projected to bring some benefits, such as fewer deaths from cold exposure.
Overall it is expected that these benefits will be outweighed by the negative health effects of rising temperatures world-wide, especially in developing countries.
The resilience of many ecosystems is likely to be exceeded this century by an unprecedented combination of climate change, associated disturbances (e.g., flooding, drought, wildfire, insects, ocean acidification), and other global drivers(e.g., land use change, pollution, over-exploitation of resources).
Some 30 per cent of Asian coral reefs, which sustain a large percentage of marine life, are expected to be lost in the next 30 years, although this will occur as a result of multiple stresses.
Over the course of this century, net carbon uptake by terrestrial ecosystems is likely to peak before mid-century and then weaken or even reverse, thus amplifying climate change.
The progressive acidification of oceans due to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide is expected to have negative impacts on marine shell forming organisms (e.g.,corals) and their dependent species.
In the Himalayas, glaciers less than four kilometers long will disappear entirely if average global temperatures rise by 3 degrees Celsius.
This will initially cause increased flooding and mudslides followed by an eventual decrease in flow in rivers that are glacier-fed.
Drought-affected areas will likely increase in extent.
Heavy precipitation events, which are very likely to increase in frequency, will augment flood risk.
While extreme weather events become more intense and more frequent, the economic and social costs of those events will increase, and these increases will be substantial in the areas most directly affected.
Climate change impacts spread from directly impacted areas and sectors to other areas and sectors through extensive and complex linkages.
Having recently returned from Washington, where I shared a platform at the Woodrow Wilson Center with Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Amanda Dory , I am struck by how similar UK and U.S. thinking is on the national security implications of climate change .
Our defense departments agree that the impact of climate change is likely to be most severe in areas where it coincides with other stresses, such as poverty , demographic growth , and resource shortages : areas through which much of the world’s trade already passes.
We are also in agreement that climate change will accelerate global instability and that it is likely to shape our future missions and tasks.
In particular we can expect to receive more frequent requests for assistance after extreme weather events.
So if we recognize the threats, what can we do about them?
In the United Kingdom we believe that the approach is two-fold.
First, we need to address the problem that we have already caused, the damage that we have done to the climate out to about 2030, through adaptation and planning for potential scenarios.
But to limit the threat to our security, we must also address the underlying causes.
It is the job of any responsible military to plan not just for the national security challenges that face us currently, but for those that might appear on our horizon in the future.
Sometimes new challenges appear from newly destabilized areas of the world.
Sometimes they arise from new methods of warfare, or new trends in science and technology.
Often, they stem from changes in the conditions under which our militaries operate.
Just as we are alive to geopolitical trends in every continent, and technical advances made by both our allies and those who seek to harm our interests, our militaries must proactively anticipate the environmental changes that will impact our national security in the coming years.
Current military operations will, rightly, always be our highest priority, but we must also find time to address future threats, including climate change.
Indeed, in some countries climate change is already impacting on the work of the military.
When I talk to colleagues from Africa and Southeast Asia it is apparent that they are already taking into account the consequences of climate change when determining their priorities.
The United States and United Kingdom can work together to establish a greater understanding of the security implications of climate change and how they will affect our missions and tasks.
We cannot afford to be caught unprepared when climate-related conflicts challenge our ability to deliver our core mission of providing national security – a risk that we must avoid.

In recent months, e-mails stolen from the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit in the United Kingdom and errors in one of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's reports have caused a flurry of questions about the validity of climate change science.
These issues have led several states, including Texas, to challenge the Environmental Protection Agency's finding that heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide (also known as greenhouse gases) are a threat to human health.
However, Texas' challenge to the EPA's endangerment finding on carbon dioxide contains very little science.
Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott admitted that the state did not consult any climate scientists, including the many here in the state, before putting together the challenge to the EPA.
Instead, the footnotes in the document reveal that the state relied mainly on British newspaper articles to make its case.
Contrary to what one might read in newspapers, the science of climate change is strong.
Our own work and the immense body of independent research conducted around the world leaves no doubt regarding the following key points:
• • The global climate is changing.
A 1.5-degree Fahrenheit increase in global temperature over the past century has been documented by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Numerous lines of physical evidence around the world, from melting ice sheets and rising sea levels to shifting seasons and earlier onset of spring, provide overwhelming independent confirmation of rising temperatures.
Any time we burn a carbon-containing fuel such as coal or natural gas or oil, it releases carbon dioxide into the air.
Carbon dioxide can be measured coming out of the tailpipe of our cars or the smokestacks of our factories.
Other heat-trapping gases, such as methane and nitrous oxide, are also produced by agriculture and waste disposal.
The effect of these gases on heat energy in the atmosphere is well understood, including factors such as the amplification of the warming by increases in humidity.
There is no question that natural causes, such as changes in energy from the sun, natural cycles and volcanoes, continue to affect temperature today.
Human activity has also increased the amounts of tiny, light-scattering particles within the atmosphere.
But despite years of intensive observations of the Earth system, no one has been able to propose a credible alternative mechanism that can explain the present-day warming without heat-trapping gases produced by human activities.
• • The higher the levels of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere, the higher the risk of potentially dangerous consequences for humans and our environment.
A recent federal report, “Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States,” commissioned in 2008 by the George W. Bush administration, presents a clear picture of how climate change is expected to affect our society, our economy and our natural resources.
Rising sea levels threaten our coasts; increasing weather variability, including heat waves, droughts, heavy rainfall events and even winter storms, affect our infrastructure, energy and even our health.
The reality of these key points is not just our opinion.
The national academies of science of 32 nations, and every major scientific organization in the United States whose members include climate experts, have issued statements endorsing these points.
The entire faculty of the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at Texas A&M as well as the Climate System Science group at the University of Texas have issued their own statements endorsing these views (atmo.tamu.edu/weather-and-climate/climate-change-statement; www.ig.utexas.edu/jsg/css/statement.html).
In fact, to the best of our knowledge, there are no climate scientists in Texas who disagree with the mainstream view of climate science.
We are all aware of the news reports describing the stolen e-mails from climate scientists and the errors in the IPCC reports.
While aspects of climate change impacts have been overstated, none of the errors or allegations of misbehavior undermine the science behind any of the statements made above.
In particular, they do not alter the conclusions that humans have taken over from nature as the dominant influence on our climate.

Imagine this.
In its latest report, the IPCC has predicted up to 3 meters of sea level rise by the end of this century.
But “climate sceptics” websites were quick to reveal a few problems (or “tricks”, as they called it).
First, although the temperature scenarios of IPCC project a maximum warming of 6.4 ºC ( Table SPM3 ), the upper limit of sea level rise has been computed assuming a warming of 7.6 ºC.
Second, the IPCC chose to compute sea level rise up to the year 2105 rather than 2100 – just to add that extra bit of alarmism.
Worse, the IPCC report shows that over the past 40 years, sea level has in fact risen 50% less than predicted by its models – yet these same models are used uncorrected to predict the future!
And finally, the future projections assume a massive ice sheet decay which is rather at odds with past ice sheet behaviour.
First, although the temperature scenarios of IPCC project a maximum warming of 6.4 ºC (Table SPM3 ), the upper limit of sea level rise has been computed for a warming of only 5.2 ºC – which reduced the estimate by about 15 cm.
Second, the IPCC chose to compute sea level rise up to the year 2095 rather than 2100 – just to cut off another 5 cm.
Worse, the IPCC report shows that over the past 40 years, sea level has in fact risen 50% more than predicted by its models – yet these same models are used uncorrected to predict the future!
And finally, the future projections assume that the Antarctic ice sheet gains mass, thus lowering sea level, rather at odds with past ice sheet behaviour.

Note that this culture is the opposite of “erring on the safe side” (assuming it is better to have overestimated the problem and made the transition to a low-carbon society a little earlier than needed, rather than to have underestimated it and sunk coastal cities and entire island nations).
Just to avoid any misunderstandings here: I am squarely against exaggerating climate change to “err on the safe side”.
I am deeply convinced that scientists must avoid erring on any side, they must always give the most balanced assessment they are capable of (and that is why I have often spoken up against “alarmist” exaggeration of climate science, see e.g.
here and here ).
Why do I find this IPCC problem far worse than the Himalaya error?
Because it is not a slip-up by a Working Group 2 author who failed to properly follow procedures and cited an unreliable source.
Rather, this is the result of intensive deliberations by Working Group 1 climate experts.
Unlike the Himalaya mistake, this is one of the central predictions of IPCC, prominently discussed in the Summary for Policy Makers.
What went wrong in this case needs to be carefully looked at when considering future improvements to the IPCC process.
And let’s see whether we learn another lesson here, this time about society and the media.
Will this evidence for an underestimation of the climate problem by IPCC, presented by an IPCC lead author who studies sea level , be just as widely reported and discussed as, say, faulty claims by a blogger about “Amazongate”?
p.s.
Recent sea level results.
A number of broadly based assessments have appeared since the last IPCC report, which all conclude that global sea level rise by the year 2100 could exceed one meter: The assessment of the Dutch Delta Commission , the Synthesis Report of the Copenhagen Climate Congress, the Copenhagen Diagnosis report as well as the SCAR report on Antarctic Climate Change .
This is also the conclusion of a number of recent peer-reviewed papers: Rahmstorf 2007 , Horton et al.
2008 , Pfeffer et al.
2008 , Grinsted et al.
2009 , Vermeer and Rahmstorf 2009 , Jevrejeva et al.
2010 (in press with GRL).
The notable exception – Siddall et al.
2009 – was withdrawn by its authors after we revealed numerical errors on Realclimate.
This is a good example of self-correction in science (in stark contrast with the climate sceptics’ practice of endlessly perpetuating false information).
Rather bizarrely, Fox News managed to turn this into the headline “ More Questions About Validity of Global Warming Theory “.
Why do you persistently elide the distinction between peak oil, and peak emissions from all fossil fuel combustion?
You have done it again here, without the ghost of an excuse since you note yourself that “coal and gas are far from their peak” in the same paragraph as you say “if fossil production is close to peak, there is no reason for acceleration”?
Why do you ignore the fact that there are reasons for sea level rise to accelerate even if emissions are lower than the SRES scenarios, given the unexpectedly rapid changes in both sea ice (raising arctic albedo) and ice sheets (raising the rate of ice flow)?
Why do you insist both that fossil fuel use can raise the entire world to the wealth of France, and that continuous economic growth during the 21st century is nothing but wishful thinking?
[Response: The destabilization of West Antarctica is possibly, perhaps even likely, over some time frame.
My own view (not shared by everyone) is that it is extremely unlikely for Greenland.
In either case the prediction is really difficult.
If the air over Antarctica gets warm enough, Pine Island Glacier will certainly collapse, as your link discusses.
And currently, warm ocean temperatures are leading to thinning, but it is far from clear that this is anything but short-term variability.
There is good evidence that rapid loss of Pine Island means the loss of most of West Antarctica.
But the time frame for that is not likely to be hundreds of years (giving ~50 cm/century) but thousands of years, and so it adds only another 5 cm or so per century to sea level rise.
The bottom line is that it is hard to say if uncertainties in ice dynamics make Stefan's calculations are overly optimistic or not.--eric]
[Response: No on two counts.
First of all I didn't add any numbers above for Antarctica, just mentioned it.
But more importantly, the finding that sea level rose 50% faster in the observations than in the models comes from Table 9.2 of the report, where you see that the models (with all forcings) give an average rise of 1.2 mm/year for the period 1961-2003, while the observations give 1.8 mm/year.
When you look at this table you find the contribution of ice sheets was added in from observations even in the model estimate.
Not sure why.

While the ice in the North Pole melts, the temperature around it barely increases, because the latent heat of fusion prevents the heat from increasing while the ice absorbs the energy necessary to melt the ice.
[Response: Almost negligible - IPCC has an analysis of this somewhere, and in terms of heat absorption only the ocean counts.
The ice melts slowly not for lack of available heat energy but because it is a poor heat conductor.
]
During this process sea levels barely rise because the ice floating actually tends to decrease sea levels as it melts, partially balancing glaciers melting that tend increases sea levels.
Once North Pole the ice is gone, temperatures are free to rise again.
With ripple effects around the earth, melting glaciers faster, then Antarctic ice.
The later rising sea levels sharply.
Antarctic ice will be much slower to melt because it will first need to rise in temperature from subzero temperatures before it starts melting.
This will also trigger another plateau.
Combined with other positive feedback effects such as the change in albedo mentioned above, and the release of increasing quantities of methane gas, this more than explains why there WILL be an accelerated temperature and sea level rise even if we stopped adding CO2 into the atmosphere.
The later hypothesis being very unlikely because of the deceptive political climate of science deniers.
a) Most of the carbon dioxide we emit goes into the oceans.
Both of these processes would seem to have a limit– that is, the more carbon dioxide is in the oceans already, the less good the oceans are at absorbing increased CO2.
Does anyone know to what degree these factors are incorporated into existing models forecasting temperature and sea level?
Thanks!
I would like to see more articles here focusing on what the science can tell us about the likelihood, timing, and geographic distribution of AGW-driven, widespread, intense and prolonged drought.
Thank you for the post.
I agree with everything you said.
IMHO, the fact that the IPCC has been extremely conservative on some fronts (Arctic sea ice) and sea level, is quite a big story.
So much for alarmism.
What the IPCC should strive for is that all the metrics for the biosphere are internally consistent.
That is no easy task in such a complex system.
But their job, and that of the scientists, is not to shelter us from inconvenient or distressing news.
It is well documented that there has been immense pressure at times to play down the seriousness of consequences associated with a much warmer planet, and this is how such inconsistencies can arise.
Alas, the media and those in denial refuse to report and recognize this fact.
There’s 6 billion people intensely interested in continuous economic growth.
More on the way.
I think we can count on relatively undiminished resource exploitation and continuing deforestation.
“While the ice in the North Pole melts, the temperature around it barely increases, because the latent heat of fusion prevents the heat from increasing while the ice absorbs the energy necessary to melt the ice.”
yes, the temperature of water mixed with ice barely increase, I agree… actually it remains almost constant neglecting the variation of salinity.
“During this process sea levels barely rise because the ice floating actually tends to decrease sea levels as it melts, partially balancing glaciers melting that tend increases sea levels.”
Actually the melting of ice floating doesn’t decrease or increase anything if you neglect the variation of volume during the mixing of salt and fresh water… but since fresh water is somewhat less dense I would say it increases a little bit.
“Once North Pole the ice is gone, temperatures are free to rise again.
With ripple effects around the earth, melting glaciers faster, then Antarctic ice.
The later rising sea levels sharply.”
really?
and the other ice doesn’t need that ?
Combined with other positive feedback effects such as the change in albedo mentioned above, and the release of increasing quantities of methane gas, this more than explains why there WILL be an accelerated temperature and sea level rise even if we stopped adding CO2 into the atmosphere.
The later hypothesis being very unlikely because of the deceptive political climate of science deniers.”
“I would like to see more articles here focusing on what the science can tell us about the likelihood, timing, and geographic distribution of AGW-driven, widespread, intense and prolonged drought.
”
[Response: The flaw in this logic is that you assume sea level rise is independent of temperature, i.e.
does not accelerate as it gets warmer.
But data show it does, and it makes physical sense too.
Do you think ice melts faster when it is warmer?
At the beginning of the 20th Century sea level rose at a rate of about 1 mm/yr, and after 0.8 ºC global warming this rate has roughly tripled, now standing at about 3 mm/year.
-stefan]
[Response: Sure - many media reports have covered the evidence for a larger sea level rise than projected by IPCC.
That was not my point.
The point is in the asymmetry: that evidence was discussed in sober and factual terms, as we did in our RC piece at the time and as it should be.
But if the IPCC made a mistake that overstates a climate impact, like the Himalaya glacier mistake, then it is hugely scandalised.
Imagine the Himalaya statement in the IPCC report would have read that by the year 2350 80% of Himalaya glacier area would likely be gone.
That would have been equally implausible and ill-founded as the year 2035, but as it understates the actual glacier melt problem, I am sure that the scandalising-machine would not have picked it up.
-stefan]
It is well known that Florida was completely covered by the ocean recently from a geological standpoint.
Yet conservative newspapers and politicians continue to deny the threat of global warming.
The great cause of Florida’s political class at the present moment is oil drilling.
Recent reviews … show that the most up to date estimates of mean rate of sea level rise for the 20th century are converging on around 1.7 to 1.8mm/year, with uncertainties of around 0.2 to 0.3mm.
…. the “slowing down” reported by some observers (around 2008) has proved short lived (judging from 2009/2010 data)….
Again refinements and corrections of recent datasets from GRACE (with GPS) and ARGO resolve previous and relatively recent difficulties, so that the sum of these climate-related contributions (2.85 ± 0.35 mm per year) is now comparable with the altimetry-based sea level rise (3.3 ± 0.4 mm per year) over the 1993 to 2007 period ….
while the steady and gradually accelerating increase since pre-industrial times of around 30cm or a foot may appear manageable, if the recent trend of accelerating mass loss from Greenland and Antarctic Ice caps, as well as the world’s glaciers continues, then the potential sea level rises will have significant impact ….
The weight of peer-reviewed evidence for this acceleration in sea level rise is robust….
Or for the current and committed warming to cause the release of just a portion of the methane currently locked in clathrate ices and the CO2 currently locked in permafrost tundra and bogs.
Just ask yourself what the mean surface temp was the last time atmospheric CO2 was at 387 ppmv, oh, about 15 mya in the middle miocene.
To be honest, given all that has poured out on WattsUpWithThat, the Bishop Hill Blog, Climate Audit,and others detailing what must now number in hundreds of problems that riddle AR4, it's not a good use of my time to get into extended arguments over this on any blog, much less one where I'm invariably responding to many people at once, and having to ignore endless snide remarks.
I'll leave it to others with more time on their hands to compile all the glitches of AR4, and all the details of misbehavior revealed by the CRU leak.
"
Well, what's somebody to do who actually knows climate scientists, and while not thinking them saintly or infallible, is pretty confident that the IPCC position, especially the part justifiably called "climate science", is pretty far from an extreme interpretation of the evidence.
Fortunately, somebody has been willing to collate the main issues, to wit, one Mark Landsbaum at the Orange County Register, in his originally titled essay " What to say to a global warming alarmist ".
Unlike our innuendo-slinging visitor, Mr. Landsbaum is willing to catalog the sins of the climate science community.
Now, given his list, we can start to examine how many, if any of them, actually are scandalous in the slightest.
So let's go over it and see what, if anything, conceivably reflects specifically on climate science.
(Update: Please note, by "climate science" above I mean specifically the physical science, that is, the aspects of the earth system covered by the IPCC WG I reports.
Thanks to Kooiti Masuda for requesting the clarification.
)
Why do such a thing if, as global warming defenders contend, the "science is settled?
"
Furthermore, it is a fairly simple exercise to extract the grid-box temperatures from a CRU dataset—CRUTEM3v for example—and compare it to raw data from World Monthly Surface Station Climatology.
CRU data are available from http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/temperature .
... In particular, it would presumably be of interest to know whether the trends in the CRU data are very different than the trends in the raw data, since this could be taken as indication that the methods used by CRU result in an overstatement of the evidence for global warming.
...
FOIGate – The British government has since determined someone at East Anglia committed a crime by refusing to release global warming documents sought in 95 Freedom of Information Act requests.
The CRU is one of three international agencies compiling global temperature data.
If their stuff's so solid, why the secrecy?
ChinaGate – An investigation by the U.K.'s left-leaning Guardian newspaper found evidence that Chinese weather station measurements not only were seriously flawed, but couldn't be located.
"Where exactly are 42 weather monitoring stations in remote parts of rural China?
" the paper asked.
The paper's investigation also couldn't find corroboration of what Chinese scientists turned over to American scientists, leaving unanswered, "how much of the warming seen in recent decades is due to the local effects of spreading cities, rather than global warming?
" The Guardian contends that researchers covered up the missing data for years.
HimalayaGate – An Indian climate official admitted in January that, as lead author of the IPCC's Asian report, he intentionally exaggerated when claiming Himalayan glaciers would melt away by 2035 in order to prod governments into action.
This fraudulent claim was not based on scientific research or peer-reviewed.
Instead it was originally advanced by a researcher, since hired by a global warming research organization, who later admitted it was "speculation" lifted from a popular magazine.
This political, not scientific, motivation at least got some researcher funded.
An admitted error in WG II, not a criticism of climate science.
Via Realclimate: In a regional chapter on Asia in Volume 2, written by authors from the region, it was erroneously stated that 80% of Himalayan glacier area would very likely be gone by 2035.
This is of course not the proper IPCC projection of future glacier decline, which is found in Volume 1 of the report.
There we find a 45-page, perfectly valid chapter on glaciers, snow and ice ( Chapter 4 ), with the authors including leading glacier experts (such as our colleague Georg Kaser from Austria, who first discovered the Himalaya error in the WG2 report).
There are also several pages on future glacier decline in Chapter 10 (“Global Climate Projections”), where the proper projections are used e.g.
to estimate future sea level rise.
So the problem here is not that the IPCC’s glacier experts made an incorrect prediction.
The problem is that a WG2 chapter, instead of relying on the proper IPCC projections from their WG1 colleagues, cited an unreliable outside source in one place.
Fixing this error involves deleting two sentences on page 493 of the WG2 report .
An admitted error in WG II, and a dubious connection (did the "voodoo" have anything to do with the Himalayan glacier error?
) , but not a criticism of climate science.
PachauriGate II – Pachauri also claimed he didn't know before the 192-nation climate summit meeting in Copenhagen in December that the bogus Himalayan glacier claim was sheer speculation.
But the London Times reported that a prominent science journalist said he had pointed out those errors in several e-mails and discussions to Pachauri, who "decided to overlook it.
" Stonewalling?
Cover up?
Pachauri says he was "preoccupied.
" Well, no sense spoiling the Copenhagen party, where countries like Pachauri's India hoped to wrench billions from countries like the United States to combat global warming's melting glaciers.
Now there are calls for Pachauri's resignation.
Do you think the head of IPCC reads every email about every nit in the document.
That is silly and clearly not his job.
Anyway, you are still beating the same horse, which has to do with WG II, and hence is not a criticism of climate science.
SternGate – One excuse for imposing worldwide climate crackdown has been the U.K.'s 2006 Stern Report, an economic doomsday prediction commissioned by the government.
Now the U.K. Telegraph reports that quietly after publication "some of these predictions had been watered down because the scientific evidence on which they were based could not be verified.
" Among original claims now deleted were that northwest Australia has had stronger typhoons in recent decades, and that southern Australia lost rainfall because of rising ocean temperatures.
Exaggerated claims get headlines.
Later, news reporters disclose the truth.
Why is that?
Indeed, exaggerated claims get headlines.
I look forward to the truth being reported.
Anyway, Stern is an economist and the report was an economic report, so this is not a criticism of climate science.
SternGate II – A researcher now claims the Stern Report misquoted his work to suggest a firm link between global warming and more-frequent and severe floods and hurricanes.
Robert Muir-Wood said his original research showed no such link.
He accused Stern of "going far beyond what was an acceptable extrapolation of the evidence.
" We're shocked.
As I understand it, this isn't true, but again, climate science is not responsible for the contents of the Stern report.
CORRECTION: I find plenty of evidence online that Muir-Wood objected to how Stern used his research.
Much is made of this by Roger Pielke Jr. and Richard Tol.
I reiterate that Stern's report was not produced by climate scientists and does not reflect on climate science.
Wikipedia has more details, from which one may gather that the questi0n is not so cut and dry as one might presume.
According to the Sunday Times in the article "Climate change study was ‘misused’"[31] the Stern report 'misused' disaster analysts research by Robert Muir-Wood, head of research at Risk Management Solutions, a US-based consultancy.
The Stern report, citing Muir-Wood, said: “New analysis based on insurance industry data has shown that weather-related catastrophe losses have increased by 2% each year since the 1970s over and above changes in wealth, inflation and population growth/movement.
[…] If this trend continued or intensified with rising global temperatures, losses from extreme weather could reach 0.5%-1% of world GDP by the middle of the century.”.
According to Muir-Wood "said his research showed no such thing and accused Stern of “going far beyond what was an acceptable extrapolation of the evidence”.
" [ 31 ]
AmazonGate – The London Times exposed another shocker: the IPCC claim that global warming will wipe out rain forests was fraudulent, yet advanced as "peer-reveiwed" science.
The Times said the assertion actually "was based on an unsubstantiated claim by green campaigners who had little scientific expertise," "authored by two green activists" and lifted from a report from the World Wildlife Fund, an environmental pressure group.
The "research" was based on a popular science magazine report that didn't bother to assess rainfall.
Instead, it looked at the impact of logging and burning.
The original report suggested "up to 40 percent" of Brazilian rain forest was extremely sensitive to small reductions in the amount of rainfall, but the IPCC expanded that to cover the entire Amazon, the Times reported.
Again, a gross exagerration of the controversy, and again, a WG II controversy and not, therefore, a criticism of climate science.
RealClimate: Leake (yet again) , with “research” by skeptic Richard North, has also promoted “Amazongate” with a story regarding a WG2 statement on the future of Amazonian forests under a drying climate.
The contested IPCC statement reads: “Up to 40% of the Amazonian forests could react drastically to even a slight reduction in precipitation; this means that the tropical vegetation, hydrology and climate system in South America could change very rapidly to another steady state, not necessarily producing gradual changes between the current and the future situation (Rowell and Moore, 2000).” Leake’s problem is with the Rowell and Moore reference, a WWF report.
The roots of the story are in two blog pieces by North, in which he first claims that the IPCC assertions attributed to the WWF report are not actually in that report.
Since this claim was immediately shown to be false, North then argued that the WWF report’s basis for their statement (a 1999 Nature article by Nepstad et al.
) dealt only with the effects of logging and fire –not drought– on Amazonian forests.
To these various claims Nepstad has now responded , noting that the IPCC statement is in fact correct.
The only issue is that the IPCC cited the WWF report rather than the underlying peer-reviewed papers by Nepstad et al.
These studies actually provide the basis for the IPCC’s estimate on Amazonian sensitivity to drought.
Investigations of the correspondence between Leake, scientists, and a BBC reporter (see here and here and here ) show that Leake ignored or misrepresented explanatory information given to him by Nepstad and another expert, Simon Lewis, and published his incorrect story anyway.
This “issue” is thus completely without merit.
From Dr Parry on KlimaZwiebel: Authors of the chapter on Latin America have demonstrated that their conclusion that ‘up to 40% of the Amazonian forests could react drastically to even a slight reduction in precipitation’ is based on peer-reviewed sources in their chapter, including information from the journal Nature.
Their statement may be obtained from the IPCC Secretariat and WG2 office.
PeerReviewGate – The U.K. Sunday Telegraph has documented at least 16 nonpeer-reviewed reports (so far) from the advocacy group World Wildlife Fund that were used in the IPCC's climate change bible, which calls for capping manmade greenhouse gases.
As far as I know, the WG I report relies on peer reviewed science, so again, this is a criticism of WG II and not a criticism of climate science.
However, WG II explicitly allows other sources of information, so this (repeated several times below) is a complete non-scandal.
RussiaGate – Even when global warming alarmists base claims on scientific measurements, they've often had their finger on the scale.
Russian think tank investigators evaluated thousands of documents and e-mails leaked from the East Anglia research center and concluded readings from the coldest regions of their nation had been omitted, driving average temperatures up about half a degree.
U.S.Gate – If Brits can't be trusted, are Yanks more reliable?
The U.S. National Climate Data Center has been manipulating weather data too, say computer expert E. Michael Smith and meteorologist Joesph D'Aleo.
Forty years ago there were 6,000 surface-temperature measuring stations, but only 1,500 by 1990, which coincides with what global warming alarmists say was a record temperature increase.
Most of the deleted stations were in colder regions, just as in the Russian case, resulting in misleading higher average temperatures.
IceGate – Hardly a continent has escaped global warming skewing.
The IPCC based its findings of reductions in mountain ice in the Andes, Alps and in Africa on a feature story of climbers' anecdotes in a popular mountaineering magazine, and a dissertation by a Switzerland university student, quoting mountain guides.
Peer-reviewed? Hype?
Worse?
WG II.
Not a criticism of climate science.
And perfectly valid evidence of impacts.
From Dr. Parry on Klimazwiebel: IPCC authors in Chapter 1 have defended their use of climbing records as part of the range of evidence of possible effects of changes in snow and ice cover on recreation.
This source was not used as evidence for ice changes per se, which was a misunderstanding in the press comment.
Their statement is available on request from the IPCC Secretariat and WG2 office.
ResearchGate – The global warming camp is reeling so much lately it must have seemed like a major victory when a Penn State University inquiry into climate scientist Michael Mann found no misconduct regarding three accusations of climate research impropriety.
But the university did find "further investigation is warranted" to determine whether Mann engaged in actions that "seriously deviated from accepted practices for proposing, conducting or reporting research or other scholarly activities.
" Being investigated for only one fraud is a global warming victory these days.
ReefGate – Let's not forget the alleged link between climate change and coral reef degradation.
The IPCC cited not peer-reviewed literature, but advocacy articles by Greenpeace, the publicity-hungry advocacy group, as its sole source for this claim.
WGII.
Not relevant to climate science.
And redundant with a previous point.
WGII.
Not relevant to climate science.
And redundant with that same previous point.
RealClimate says: The IPCC Synthesis Report states: “By 2020, in some countries, yields from rain-fed agriculture could be reduced by up to 50%.” This is properly referenced back to chapter 9.4 of WG2, which says: “In other countries, additional risks that could be exacerbated by climate change include greater erosion, deficiencies in yields from rain-fed agriculture of up to 50% during the 2000-2020 period, and reductions in crop growth period (Agoumi, 2003).” The Agoumi reference is correct and reported correctly.
The Sunday Times, in an article by Jonathan Leake, labels this issue “Africagate” – the main criticism being that Agoumi (2003) is not a peer-reviewed study (see below for our comments on “gray” literature), but a report from the International Institute for Sustainable Development and the Climate Change Knowledge Network, funded by the US Agency for International Development.
The report, written by Morroccan climate expert Professor Ali Agoumi, is a summary of technical studies and research conducted to inform Initial National Communications from three countries (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and is a perfectly legitimate IPCC reference.
It is noteworthy that chapter 9.4 continues with “However, there is the possibility that adaptation could reduce these negative effects (Benhin, 2006).
From Dr. Parry on Klimazwiebel: The statement that in Africa ‘by 2020, in some countries, yields from rain-fed agriculture could be reduced by up to 50%’ relates to the combined effects of climate variability and climate change, as correctly reported in the chapter on Africa and in the WG2 TS and SPM.
A similar qualifier should have been included in the SYR.
The statement may be obtained from the IPCC Secretariat and WG2 office.
DutchGate – The IPCC also claimed rising sea levels endanger the 55 percent of the Netherlands it says is below sea level.
The portion of the Netherlands below sea level actually is 20 percent.
The Dutch environment minister said she will no longer tolerate climate researchers' errors.
WGII.
Not relevant to climate science.
And redundant with that same previous point.
And completely silly, to boot.
The amount threatened by rising seas is not identical to the amount below sea level.
It's not as if this were a research question.
Skanky offers: "Sea level in the Netherlands: The WG2 report states that "The Netherlands is an example of a country highly susceptible to both sea-level rise and river flooding because 55% of its territory is below sea level".
This sentence was provided by a Dutch government agency - the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, which has now published a correction stating that the sentence should have read "55 per cent of the Netherlands is at risk of flooding; 26 per cent of the country is below sea level, and 29 per cent is susceptible to river flooding".
It surely will go down as one of the more ironic episodes in its history when the Dutch parliament last Monday derided the IPCC, in a heated debate, for printing information provided by ... the Dutch government.
In addition, the IPCC notes that there are several definitions of the area below sea level.
The Dutch Ministry of Transport uses the figure 60% (below high water level during storms), while others use 30% (below mean sea level).
Needless to say, the actual number mentioned in the report has no bearing on any IPCC conclusions and has nothing to do with climate science, and it is questionable whether it should even be counted as an IPCC error.
"
Which is what we would have expected.
Why? Because the climate science conspiracy being proposed would require very smart and very sinister people, if for no other reason than the necessity of getting all the national science academies on board .
But smart and sinister people have better ways of making money than getting Ph.D.s and postdocs and ultimately striving for tenure at the meteorology department at Penn State or East Anglia.
My (extremely non-expert) understanding of tree rings: the reason tree rings exist is because trees grow faster in the spring than in the summer, and this difference creates recognisable bands in the wood.
By extension, in warmer years, tree rings are larger than in cold years, so tree rings can be a proxy record for climate.
I probably understand what you mean by "climate science", and then agree with your remarks.
But I am afraid some readers may disagree just because of the terminology.
I think it natural to call it "climate science" in the context of "science vs. politics". This broader climate science includes such parts of ecology (more than evapotranspiration and photosynthesis), social science, engineering etc.
that are relevant to the issue of climate change.
Actual political negotiations are excluded, but objective studies of political feasibility should logically be included.
As for this article, I suggest that you add a declaration statement [*] about your definition of "climate science" at the top.
It's hardly fair to call this a straw man argument when I actually am making a request for stronger arguments.
I am looking for any articles supporting the widespread implication that something is actually scandalous and actually casts doubt on climate science.

"
You've got to wonder about someone who will try to spin a revision of the rate of mass loss in Alaskan glaciers into a scandalous failure of climate science.
If a measurement of climate change is refined to a smaller quantity, it shows the original work was dishonest.
If it is refined to a larger quantity, it shows that the later work was dishonest.
If it unchanged, it shows that all the work was dishonest.
I guess that Pachauri meant that the Indian report is inferior to the Chapter 4 of IPCC AR4 WG1 (part of climate science in mt's sense).
Thanks for this topic.
A tribute to the climate science blogging community is that I immediately knew these scandals were inconsequential to the science, and so I largely ignored the details.
It's nice to have this reference, as I no doubt will be called upon to explain the various "gates".
"The news has been screaming that a future of intense, global climate disasters is not the future that we want .

We cannot afford to face escalating disasters of that kind.”

“Legitimacy has shifted to the side of the climate skeptics, and that is a big, big problem.
This is happening in the context of overwhelming scientific agreement that climate change is real and a threat.
But the poll figures are going through the floor.”
From 2000 through 2004, 262 million people were affected by climate disasters each year, 98 percent of whom live in the developing world.
A resident of a developing country faced 79 times greater risk of being affected by a climate-induced disaster than a resident of an OECD country.
"The only time...carbon dioxide levels [were] similar to the modern level of 387 parts per million was 15 to 20 million years ago, when the planet was dramatically different.

"Our house is burning down and we're blind to it...The earth and humankind are in danger and we are all responsible...We cannot say that we did not know!
Climate warming is still reversible.
Heavy would be the responsibility of those who refused to fight it.

The Pentagon will for the first time rank global warming as a destabilising force, adding fuel to conflict and putting US troops at risk around the world, in a major strategy review to be presented to Congress tomorrow.
The quadrennial defence review, prepared by the Pentagon to update Congress on its security vision, will direct military planners to keep track of the latest climate science, and to factor global warming into their long term strategic planning.
"While climate change alone does not cause conflict, it may act as an accelerant of instability or conflict, placing a burden on civilian institutions and militaries around the world," said a draft of the review seen by the Guardian.
Heatwaves and freak storms could put increasing demand on the US military to respond to humanitarian crises or natural disaster.
But troops could feel the effects of climate change even more directly, the draft says.
The review's release coincides with a sharpening focus in the American defence establishment about global warming – even though polls last week showed the public increasingly less concerned.
The CIA late last year established a centre to collect intelligence on climate change.
Earlier this month, CIA officials sent emails to environmental experts in Washington seeking their views on climate change impacts around the world, and how the agency could keep tabs on what actions countries were taking to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The CIA has also restarted a programme – scrapped by George Bush – that allowed scientists and spies to share satellite images of glaciers and Arctic sea ice.
That suggests climate change is here to stay as a topic of concern for the Pentagon.
The Pentagon, in acknowledging the threat of global warming, will now have to factor climate change into war game exercises and long-term security assessments of badly affected regions such as the Arctic, sub-Saharan Africa, and South Asia.
Military planners will have to factor climate change into war game exercises and long-term security assessments of badly affected regions such as the Arctic, sub-Saharan Africa, and South Asia.
"The leadership of the Pentagon has very strongly indicated that they do consider climate change to be a national security issue," said Christine Parthemore, an analyst at the Centre for a New American Security, who has been studying the Pentagon's evolving views on climate change.
"They are considering climate change on a par with the political and economic factors as the key drivers that are shaping the world.
"
Awareness of climate change and its impact on threat levels and military capability had been slowly percolating through the ranks since 2008 when then Senators Hillary Clinton and John Warner pushed the Pentagon to look specifically at the impact of global warming in its next long-term review.
But the navy was already alive to the potential threat, with melting sea ice in the Arctic opening up a new security province.
The changing chemistry of the oceans, because of global warming, is also playing havoc with submarine sonar, a report last year from the CNAS warned.
In addition to the threat of global warming, she said the Pentagon was concerned that US military bases in America were vulnerable because of their reliance on the electric grid to cyber attack and overload in case of a natural disaster.
Parthemore writes of an exchange on a department of defence list-serv in December 2008 about whether global warming exists.
It ends with one official writing: "This is increasingly shrill and pedantic.
Moreover, it's becoming boring.
"
The US slow response is a cover for a gameplan with climate already well factored in!
!
Ironic that the Pentagon has to take into account global warming scenarios, considering that a good chunk of the Pentagon budget goes to protect oil shipping and oil production areas - and that their yearly fuel costs are $3-$4 billion.
Not very happy with the picture-poor fisherman walking on dried river-obviously starving and all due to global warming
The existing Lam Takhong reservoir which serves as the lower dam is an earthfill dam (40.3 meters high and 251 meters long) with a storage capacity of 310 million cubic meters.
The upper dam is a rockfill dam with asphalt facing (50 meters high and 2,170 meters long) which covers only a small surface area of 0.34 square kilometers and has a storage capacity of 10.3 million cubic meters.
The 500 MW underground powerhouse, the first and the biggest in Thailand, is located 350 meters below the ground surface and accommodates two 250 MW reversible pumped turbine generators.
There are two penstocks (651 meters long and 6 meters in diameter) which connect the upper pond to the power plant, and two tailrace tunnels (1,430 meters long and 6.8 meters in diameter) which link the power plant to the lower dam.
I don't see any controversy here.
No one denies climate change.
It is unarguable.
The foil hatters say it it's not caused by man made emissions.
Another thing entirely.
How ironic that during all the years right-wing Americans have been denying global warming, the US military and security establishment has not only accepted it but been planning for it.
And you're wrong owaingr, they do accept the human causes.
One of these days conservatives are going to have to address this huge disconnect within their camp.
To the people that will have to deal with the financial and geo-political consequences of climate change (insurance industry, the Pentagon) there is little or no doubt that it is happening.
What do the climate change deniers have to say about that?
Sure if the US and their allies keep hawking weapons systems around the globe at the rate they are doing, then there's little point in worrying about global warming because World War III over the "Holy Land" in the Middle East will have rubbed us all out by then.
A dried up reservoir of a dammed up river is not a good demonstration of global warming.
Mountain fed rivers shrink dramatically through the summer whilst communities & industry below dammed rivers tend to grow rapidley.
Man made local environmental disasters are not the same as global warming.
'The CIA has also restarted a programme ?
scrapped by George Bush ?
that allowed scientists and spies to share satellite images of glaciers and Arctic sea ice'
A dried up reservoir of a dammed up river is not a good demonstration of global warming.
OK - why the debate over the image remoteviewer?
Anthropogenic modification of climate, with resultant decreases in annual precipitation are not global warming, but rather a consequence of the overall peturbance to the system: discrepancies in terminology and/or correct use of imagery of drought-stricken areas does not undermine the concept as a whole.
So, basically, those that have read nothing of any substance, i.e.
scientific journals, "good" and/or "reliable" sources (such as government agencies - in the EU and US) and have to come to the conclusion that "science" is "wrong", scientists are "making up" data and that climate science is crap, don't like it when someone other than the "usual suspects" tell us the same thing?
It really is quite telling that those that don't want to believe in anthropogenically-mediated climate change are generally those that take little or no time to understand anything of substance.
It takes some time, not a cursory look at an oil industry - funded blog to understand and appreciate the mechanisms and (highly) likely outcomes of climate change.
It would have been nice if some of those that generally opt for the "skeptic" point of view to comment on this article and express that, maybe, they may be becoming increasingly "skeptical" in their own "skeptical" outlook.
Suppose it will take more than that for them to change their lifestyle in ANY significant measure - which I believe is the principal cause of "skepticism".
The cost of the Iraq war, spent on worldwide reduction of CO2 emission instead, would have made more difference to the problem of climate change than any tweaking of policy by the Pentagon.
What planet are they on?
Ours, sadly.
Yes: let's talk about the picture, let's talk about British imperialism, let's talk about anything except the fact that the Pentagon not only believes the threat from global warming is real and imminent but they are putting their money where their mouth is.
So this time its global warming.
And they are quite right to be considering the security implications of it in my view, for better or for worse.
The headline led me to hope for a report on a certain proposed high-tech intervention, said to be under development in the US, that, if successful, will be applied directly to the atmosphere to disrupt what is said to be causing heat retention.
WMD had its dodgy dossiers.
global warming has the IPCC.
Bank-financed projects including the Pak Mun dam (1994) and Lam Takhong (2004) have seriously and negatively affected Thai people who depend upon natural resources including land, forest, rivers and fisheries for their livelihoods.
. .
.
Your picture is entitled "A fisherman in the dried reservoir of Lam Takhong Dam, Thailand, a consequence of global warming" and that is obviously a crude lie.
People have woken up and smelt the coffee now - you just cannot peddle that line any longer.
You just look stupid and get laughed at.
Some quick notes about the photo used at the top of this piece.
It appears to be a stock photo used by many news sites when linking to stories about climate change.
A little digging on Google turns up that the Lam Thakhong dam was subject to a drought in 2005
I'm sure everyone has their own thoughts on if the drought was caused by global warming.
"The changing chemistry of the oceans, because of global warming, is also playing havoc with submarine sonar .
. .
"
Moreover, using this photograph in this way takes our attention away from the misuse of water by the Thai government, and makes us attribute it to climate change.
Nice one, Guardian.
(not).
Climate change does cause conflict, there are already examples of water wars , the Israel Palestinian conflict, with Gaza being deprived, There are examples everywhere.
People use water as a weapon and we have allowed water to be privatised..HUGE mistake.
We have ruined aquifers, destroyed rivers with dams,polluted lakes, and the Pentagon thinks there is no real problem, they need to get out more.
We will certainly have more water wars.
This is a perfect demonstration of the inability of deniers to add two and two together and not get a prime number as the result.
There will be no extra funds made available by Obama's Marxist banker government to address climate change impacts and instabilities, because those staunch allies of the Military/industrial complex - the republican party - are blocking any attempts to raise those funds.
ha ha if you Google this topic you find some interesting facts from our Amercian friends.
A pro-climate warming senator has said that an upcoming pentagon report will for the 1st time list climate change as a risk and evaluate various scenarios.
Good try lads - but isn't aggressive aliens landing in New York also one of the risks they've also evaluated with scenarios?
As I said, the deniers are just being slow off the mark in developing tactics to breach this new military angle, in their battle to neuter calls for action against carbon pollution.
Picking on the photo is just pathetic, but I'm sure they'll think of something better soon.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Arctic ice melting could cost global agriculture, real estate and insurance anywhere from $2.4 trillion to $24 trillion by 2050 in damage from rising sea levels, floods and heat waves, according to a report released on Friday.
The loss of Arctic Sea ice and snow cover is already costing the world about $61 billion to $371 billion annually from costs associated with heat waves, flooding and other factors, the report said.
The losses could grow as a warmer Arctic unlocks vast stores of methane in the permafrost.
The gas has about 21 times the global warming impact of carbon dioxide.
Melting of Arctic sea ice is already triggering a feedback of more warming as dark water revealed by the receding ice absorbs more of the sun's energy, he said.
That could lead to more melting of glaciers on land and raise global sea levels.
Thin ice over the Arctic Sea this winter could mean a powerful ice-melt next summer, a top U.S. climate scientist said this week.
And early findings from a major research project in Canada involving more than 370 scientists from 27 countries showed on Friday that climate change is transforming the Arctic environment faster than expected and accelerating the disappearance of sea ice.
Goodstein's study did not look at worst-case scenarios Arctic melting could have, such as warmer temperatures that trigger massive releases of crystallized methane formations in Arctic soils and ocean beds known as methane hydrates.
It also did not look at sea ice erosion troubling people in the Arctic.

Who would be a climate scientist?
You spend your life locked in a lab doing obscure statistical analyses of tree rings, and then suddenly a hidden curtain is raised and your ivory tower transforms into a hostile courtroom.
Every private thought you have been foolish enough to commit to email over the past decade is put on display before a baying public.
And intimidating tribunals are set up to pronounce on your alleged crimes.
Now, after some initial reluctance, even the liberal media establishment is falling over itself to get in on the act, presumably to demonstrate its great rigour and impartiality -- all paranoid conspiracists will be duly taken seriously, all climate deniers given their deserved moment in the sun.
Witness the Guardian trumpeting its great "investigation" over three successive double-page spreads, though accompanied in one case by a curious comment piece, authored by one of the principal investigators (New Scientist's Fred Pearce), correctly pointing out that the hullabaloo is a non-story and changes nothing that we know about the reality of anthropogenic global warming.
I think this is a shameful episode.
Having followed their work for years, I still see no reason to doubt the professional integrity of the Climatic Research Unit scientists and their US colleagues.
Without their dedication, as individuals and as part of the unprecedented collaborative effort of the IPCC, we would not see the problem of global warming as clearly as we do today.
Climategate may seem important now, but it is all sound and fury, signifying nothing.
Mark Lynas, environmental activist and climate change advisor to the Maldives, why have you included a picture of Mt Kilimanjaro?
If you were in any way interested in the science you would know that the temperature on Mt Kilimanjaro has not changed and that the ice has been receding since before significant human CO2 emissions.
It is well known that they have shrunk via sublimation due to less humidity and precipitation, not global warming.
Better enjoy those free trips to the Maldives while "climate change advisor" is still a job description.
Got your scuba gear?
I hear they are having another underwater cabinet meeting real soon.
Those who want to see a no-holds-barred scientific presentation about global-warming should watch this lecture video: http://www.agu.org/meetings/fm09/lectures/lecture_videos/A23...
I doubt the majority of climate scientists are responsible for the sudden blow-back.
It's the handful who've stepped beyond their field of study (climate) and gave in to the temptation of the limelight.
What a narcotic rush to be on TV, at the U.N. or in front of a government panel, predicting with total confidence a precise, "catastrophic" impact on oceans, plants, animals, glaciers, ecosystems, agriculture and humans 50-100 years into the future.
climate change seems to be the horse riding which new technology could be forced down the throats
BUT these worthies talking climate change only want to ask those living on edge of desolate existence
The national media’s continued silence on ClimateGate and increasing revelations of outright fraud and wrongdoing at all levels of government, academia and the media itself, tells the truth of the tail.
That truth is there's a lot more to this ClimateGate story than what little is being reported.
The small (2 to 3 dozen) international cabal of climate scientists could not have possibly gotten to this point without extraordinary funding, political support at virtually all levels of government, especially at the national level and unparalleled cooperation from the national and world media.
This wide-spread networked support continues even as we-the-people puzzle over what this is all about.
I ask you, "What are you seeing and hearing from our national media on the subject?
" Anything?
What are you seeing and hearing from all levels of our government, local and regional newspapers and media outlets?
Anything of substance?
At all of these levels the chatter has remained remarkably quite on the subject, wouldn't you say?
Why? What points and positions are you beginning to hear on the radio and see on the television?
This cabal of scientists has an unprecedented level of support given the revelations contained in the emails, documented in the computer software code and elaborated in the associated programmer remarks (REM) within the code.
And ---- this has gone on for years, AND continues even in the presence of the most damning evidence one could imagine, or even hope for.
Watergate pales in comparison, given the trillions of dollars in carbon offset taxes, cap & trade fees hanging in the balance and the unimaginable political control over people’s lives this all implies.
The mainstream media's conspiracy of silence proves the point.
Their continued cover-up is as much a part of this crime as the actual scientific fraud.
ABC, CBS and NBC are simply co-conspirators exercising their 5th Amendment rights.
In the next few weeks farmers are going to be making decisions about what crops to plant for the year.
It is looking possible, or even likely that the ground may not be workable until later than usual this spring, and if the arctic oscillation index keeps diving down and staying low for prolonged periods like has been for the past few months, there could be some very late hard frosts.
I took the trouble to spend 20 years studying climate science and its relationship to human history.
Then I completed master's degree in Earth science at a US university.
But I'm still a barbarian because, while I accept global warming, I see no possibility of avoiding it by human intervention.
Not only that, the 5000-year history of global warming and global cooling suggests that the warming periods benefit manking.
Global cooling is what we have to fear.
@Not so obvious, what is your screen name on the Guardian?
Mine is CarbonFooledYa.
Was that the article dated Thursday 11 February 2010 15.30 GMT?
If so I had my comment removed from the exact same article for the exact same reason.
It's kind of like Soviet Russia at the Guardian with the moderation.
In that article I mentioned that the glaciers didn't melt during past warmer periods because it's not just temperature but precipitation which is involved.
For me cosmic and solar radiation is far more influential in controlling celestial mechanics including the rotation of the earth and may even be responsible for geothermal heat.
Why should the earth still produce internal heat after 4.5 billion years in existence?
For me the radioactive decay theory is in adequate - there's energy coming from somewhere (or being manifest from the vacuum perhaps?
) There's an interesting article out now from Waterloo University Professor Qing-Bin Lu on how the ozone hole may be linked to global warming by letting more nuclear rays in.
I don't agree with the CFCs part but the warming due to cosmic and solar rays seems interesting.
See press release at: http://newsrelease.uwaterloo.ca/news.php?id=5152 .
Global warming is happening.
Even the oil industry admits it.
As petroleum geologists are fond of saying, the rocks don't lie.
Why do you think they are investing millions in carbon sequestration?
They are convinced by the science.
You say oil is "convinced by the science"?
You misunderstand the nature of the oil business.
They don't care about the environment or the science.
If they go along with global warming it's because of economics, period.
With all of this bundled human intelligence just jumping off the page here I can't understand why there is any doubt about man-made climate change.
Is this the level of intelligence now acceptable to climate change debate.
You cannot defend the with holding of core data, it was a fundemental breach of all that science stands for.
It was deliberatly withheld in defiance of the FoI because it did undermien the conclusions reached.
Public confidence has been undermined because the claimd made on climate change have been shown to be exagerated, not substantiated or plai wrong.
For climate change subsitute Iraqi weopons of mass destruction "data had to be withheld to prevent the undermining of public confidence".
Please get writers who have some understanding of what integrity means
No, dude!
Read the emails, they are traveling everywhere for "conferences" in Tahiti, Davos, etc.
Amp up climate change and become a star!
No-one here believes, although many are saying, that there is any speck in the climate scientists' eyes.
"No-one here believes, although many are saying, that there is any speck in the climate scientists' eyes.
"
As a scientist, I find it terrible to read this statement.
Especially, since I believe in anthropogenic climate change and I hope to find it presented intelligently in an intelligent magazine.
Of course, the data should be open.
Science is about building models that explain observation, in a rational way.
It's already unfortunate that science has become so specialized that the general public cannot relate to it.
But the idea that academics and other experts should restrict data to lay-people because they know that it would be used to disagree with them is completely unsupportable.
Mark Lynas is not a scientist (I checked his bio) and does not properly represent the views of what must be the great majority of scientists who believe in openness and objectivity.
The Earth is heated by the Sun, receiving energy in the form of sunlight.
A lot of this is stored by the atmosphere and by the oceans .
The Earth too, gives off heat, although this cannot be seen as light, but sometimes as heat shimmers on a hot day.
This balance of incoming and outgoing heat keeps the Earth's climate fairly stable, at an average temperature of about 15°C.
This is warmer than the Moon's surface because greenhouse gases in air trap more heat in the atmosphere.
This is called the natural greenhouse effect .
Over time however, changes can occur in the amount of energy coming from the Sun , or in the way that heat is stored in the atmosphere and oceans.
These changes can cause the Earth's climate to shift.
Air pollution from volcanic eruptions can block some sunlight and cause a small cooling of the Earth's climate for up to 2 years.
Changes in ocean currents and in the amount of energy given off by the Sun may also influence climate over tens or hundreds of years.
Changes in the way the Earth orbits the Sun could explain the Earth's Ice Ages , the last of which ended only 14,000 years ago.
Far back in the history of the Earth, the planet was once much warmer than it is today.
Over time it has gradually cooled down because of the drifting of continents and the building of mountains , which have affected the way heat is stored in the atmosphere and the oceans.
30 years ago scientist predicted that the next Ice Age was on its way.
Today, we have become far more concerned about the possibility of global warming .
Mankind, through pollution of the atmosphere, has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in air.
This has increased the strength of the greenhouse effect, which may explain the rise in the Earth's surface temperature during the 20th century.
One paper in the special issue proposes strategies for catalyzing greater collaboration on climate change communication among the "four cultures.
"
The special issue is the outcome of a 2009 conference hosted by the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies and organized by Cary scientist Peter Groffman .
(In a podcast interview , Groffman reflects on the conference and contributions from attendees.
)
I was one of several co-authors who had the opportunity to team with Groffman on the "over-arching issues" paper.
Titled " Restarting the Conversation: Challenges at the interface between ecology and society ," the paper reviews research on how the public and decision-makers learn, form opinions, and reach judgments about complex environmental problems such as climate change.
In a table that I put together, the differences between how scientists and communication researchers tend to view these processes are summarized, with assumptions grouped by the "Deficit model" versus the "Public Engagement model.
"
In a separate commentary that I co-authored with Mark Hixon (Oregon State), Kathleen Dean Moore (Oregon State), and Michael Nelson (Michigan State), we raise attention to the need for multidisciplinary partnerships in the area of climate change communication.
The essay is based on the insights, revelations, and conclusions from the 16 member Columbia River Quorum, which was composed of scientists, scholars, and professionals - four representatives from each of what we describe as the four academic "cultures" - who met in Oregon in 2009 for the first of what we hope will be many similar summits across the world.
The goal of that meeting was to identify and build synergies by which members of traditionally separate disciplinary cultures -- specifically the environmental sciences, philosophy and religion, the social sciences, and the creative arts and professions -- can accomplish collaboratively what none are capable of doing alone (see Figure above).
In the essay, we propose specific strategies for catalyzing these inter-disciplinary partnerships with the goal of creating a new communication infrastructure around the issue of climate change.
These strategies include a bold proposal to pool "public impact" money from individual research grants at the university level to be re-invested by a "four culture" expert committee in local and regional public engagement initiatives.
It also includes a call for a digital news community--a Chronicle of Higher Ed focused on climate change education and communication--that would serve as a catalyst for identifying and diffusing best practices and partnerships.
Today's dangerous idea is posed by bioethicist Jacob Appel who suggests that the government should supplement our drinking water with lithium, which some studies suggest might lower suicide rates.
You can watch Appel pitch his dangerous idea below and read more about his proposal--along with the arguments against-- at Big Think's Dangerous Ideas blog .
If we were able to statistically model societal inaction on climate change, what proportion of the variance would be accounted for by the disinformation efforts of skeptics and false balance by journalists?
Perhaps 10%.
Maybe 15%?
[Commentators] unfortunately tend to exaggerate the influence of climate skeptics while overlooking the many other factors that contribute to societal gridlock...
The public opinion and media environment also contributed to the legislative defeat, but this factor is far more complex than narrowly blaming the work of skeptics, conservative media, or claims about "false balance" in coverage.
As I described in a panel presentation earlier this year at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, legislation on climate change--which necessitates a non-incremental, systemic change in policy--should be compared to other similar policy debates such as welfare or immigration reform where wider public opinion and the level of news attention has played a decisive role.
As the recent Six Americas of Global Warming report shows, the U.S. public has yet to come to the type of widespread consensus and opinion-intensity on the issue that creates the incentive for the White House, Democratic members of Congress, and moderates among Republicans to take the political risks to pass legislation.
In conjunction with our policy approach to the problem, we also need to rethink how we communicate about the relevance of climate change and importantly the benefits that would accrue from proposed action.
Environmental groups spent record amounts of resources on advertising and lobbying in support of cap and trade.
From this effort, what lessons were learned?
What appears to have been successful?
What strategies can be ruled out as dead ends?
The Senate's failure to act is a result of many factors, but one is that the climate-energy policy debate got disconnected from average people.
We need less talk about "climate" and more about how conservation saves money, renewable energy creates jobs, restoring the gulf's marshes sustains fishermen and preserving the rainforest helps poor people.
Said Glenn Prickett, vice president at the Nature Conservancy: "We have to take climate change out of the atmosphere, bring it down to earth and show how it matters in people's everyday lives.
"
In reaction to our BMC Public Health study published this month that examined the potential to re-frame climate change in terms of health, reader Stephanie Parent had this astute observation, one worth testing in follow up research.
I was jazzed to read your article "Maibach et al., Reframing climate change as a public health issue: an exploratory study of public reactions BMC Public Health 2010, 10:299" and learn of the Center for Climate Change Communication.
The discussion regarding Figures 4 and 5 struck an idea regarding how people did not respond well to the sentence about increasing consumption of fruits and vegetables and reducing meat consumption.
In comparing this sentence with the others, I noticed that the other sentences are societal or governmental actions to change land use or offer services, while the food consumption sentence is based on changing personal behavior, which people tend to be reluctant to change and feel their personal way of life and liberty is being attacked.
While not quite the same, what if you reframe the sentence in a way that sounds more like a societal change rather than a personal behavior change to "Increasing the availability of fruits and vegetables and healthy food options to help people maintain a healthy weight, will help prevent heart disease and cancer, and will play an important role in limiting global warming.
"
What do readers think?
Should we hold off on emphasizing personal changes to diet until more engagement is done on the public health implications of climate change?
Or are you (and the public) likely open to suggestions about societal changes in food availability and costs that lead to healthier diets and cut down on greenhouse gas emissions from food production?
Changing the conversation about climate change: Graduate students from American and George Mason Universities prepare interview tent on the National Mall.
WASHINGTON, DC -- How do Americans respond when they are asked to reflect on the public health risks of climate change and the benefits to health from mitigation-related actions?
In other words, if we were to re-frame climate change in terms of localized impacts that people personally experience and can understand--such as vulnerability to extreme heat or poor air quality--could we shift public thinking on the issue?
Those are the questions that I examine with Ed Maibach and colleagues in a study published this month at the open access journal BMC Public Health.
We find that even Americans who tend to discount climate change or are ambivalent about its relevance react favorably when the issue is re-framed in the context of public health.
Our results suggest that when it comes to public engagement, health experts have an important perspective to share about climate change.
This still dramatically under-communicated perspective offers Americans a compelling way to think about an issue that has proven deeply difficult for many people to fully comprehend.
The new frame of reference also focuses on a range of possible policy actions that offer local as well as global benefits.
Held in over 30 countries, the World Wide Views on Global Warming initiative represents the state-of-the-art in new approaches to public engagement, the subject of several recent reports and meetings.
This video features a short documentary on the Australian event.
Communications solutions differ significantly depending on whether a scientific issue has been around for a long time (e.g., how to dispose of nuclear waste) or is relatively new (e.g., the spread of personal genetic information).
In the case of longstanding controversies, social scientists may have had the opportunity to conduct research on public views that can inform communication strategies.
For emerging technologies, there will be less reliable analysis available of public attitudes.

A wide expanse of Arctic Ocean seabed is bubbling methane into the atmosphere.
This is the first time that the ocean has been found to be releasing this powerful greenhouse gas into the atmosphere on this scale.
The discovery will rekindle fears that global warming might be on the verge of unlocking billions of tonnes of methane from beneath the oceans, which could trigger runaway climate change .
The trouble is, nobody knows if the Arctic emissions are new, or indeed anything to do with global warming.
Between 2003 and 2008 Natalia Shakhova of the University of Alaska Fairbanks and colleagues collected 5000 samples of seawater over the East Siberian Arctic Shelf, the world's largest area of continental shelf, and measured the levels of methane at different depths.
They also measured levels of the gas in the atmosphere above the shelf in 2006.
The team used their measurements to calculate that the region is releasing about 7 million tonnes of methane a year – about 2 per cent of overall methane emissions to the atmosphere, half of which result from human activity.
That doesn't sound like much, but the fear is that as the Arctic warms, it could release more and more of the gas.
Shakhova warns that the release of "only a small fraction of the methane held in the ice shelf could trigger abrupt climate warming".
Larry Smith of the University of California, Los Angeles, says the newly discovered emissions from the continental shelf appear to be "one of the largest known methane sources of the northern hemisphere".
Researchers have speculated that the Siberian emissions could explain an unexpected rise in concentrations of methane in the atmosphere, globally, over the past three years.
However, it is not clear whether the leakage is a new phenomenon.
Graham Westbrook of the University of Birmingham, UK, reported 250 submarine methane hotspots off the Arctic islands of Svalbard last year, but did not determine whether they were affecting the atmosphere above.
"The subsea permafrost has been degrading and leaking methane beneath for thousands of years," he told New Scientist.
He added that nobody knows how much of the recently detected methane releases are due to human influence on climate and that the fraction "is probably quite small".
Maybe we need to urgently research ways of trapping this sea and peat methane to prevent it venting into the atmosphere - turn the potential setback into an opportunity fot gather free fuel for fuel cells.
You forget that methane decays much more quickly than CO2 in the atmosphere.
The net effect could very well be the same over time.
Environmental policy can, unfortunately, be used to pursue many economic and social goals tangential to the primary aim of improving environmental quality.
A recent protectionist example is highlighted in a recent TEC post from the Center for American Progress ...
The implication of this research is that environmental policy in general and climate change policy in particular should not be used as an excuse to erect trade barriers.
Climate change policy should be implemented based on an examination of the environmental benefits and the environmental costs.
Other economic and social goals should be pursued outside of the climate change policy arena.
Abstract: We develop estimates of the economic effects of climate change-induced sea level rise on recreation at seventeen southern North Carolina beaches.
We estimate the relationship between recreation behavior and beach width and simulate the effects of sea level rise on recreation site choice and trip frequency.
We find that reductions in beach width due to increased erosion from sea-level rise negatively affect the number and value of beach recreation trips.
For beach goers who only take day trips, we estimate that four percent of recreation value is lost in 2030 and 11 percent is lost in 2080.
For those who take both day and overnight trips, 16 percent and 34 percent of recreation value is lost in 2030 and 2080, respectively.
The present value of the lost recreation value through 2080 assuming no increase in population or income is $9 billion, $4 billion and $722 million with 0 percent, 2 percent and 7 percent discount rates.
With expected increases in population and income the present value of the lost recreation value is $29 billion, $11 billion and $2 billion with 0 percent, 2 percent and 7 percent discount rates.
The Environmental Protection Agency presented its analysis of the Waxman-Markey bill on Tuesday and said the contentious plan would cost households less than $150 a year.
That’s a far cry from some of the dueling price tags that have been bandied about.
Republican leadership in the House of Representatives says the climate bill will cost families about $3,000 a year.
After a thorough scientific review ordered in 2007 by the U.S. Supreme Court, the Environmental Protection Agency issued a proposed finding Friday that greenhouse gases contribute to air pollution that may endanger public health or welfare.
“This finding confirms that greenhouse gas pollution is a serious problem now and for future generations.
Fortunately, it follows President Obama’s call for a low carbon economy and strong leadership in Congress on clean energy and climate legislation,” said Administrator Lisa P. Jackson. “This pollution problem has a solution – one that will create millions of green jobs and end our country’s dependence on foreign oil.”

One of the country’s leading journalists has written a searing critique of the media’s coverage of global warming, especially climate economics.
How Much Would You Pay to Save the Planet?
The American Press and the Economics of Climate Change is by Eric Pooley for Harvard’s prestigious Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy.
Pooley has been managing editor of Fortune, national editor of Time, Time’s chief political correspondent, and Time’s White House correspondent, where he won the Gerald Ford Prize for Excellence in Reporting.
Before that, he was senior editor of New York magazine.
In short, Pooley has earned the right to be heard.
Journalists and senior editors need to pay heed to Pooley’s three tough conclusions abut how “damaging” the recent media of the climate debate has been:
The press misrepresented the economic debate over cap and trade.
It failed to recognize the emerging consensus … that cap and trade would have a marginal effect on economic growth and gave doomsday forecasts coequal status with nonpartisan ones….
The press allowed opponents of climate action to replicate the false debate over climate science in the realm of climate economics.
The press failed to perform the basic service of making climate policy and its economic impact understandable to the reader and allowed opponents of climate action to set the terms of the cost debate.
The argument centered on the short-term costs of taking action–i.e., higher electricity and gasoline prices–and sometimes assumed that doing nothing about climate change carried no cost.
Editors failed to devote sufficient resources to the climate story.
In general, global warming is still being shoved into the “environment” pigeonhole, along with the spotted owls and delta smelt, when it is clearly to society’s detriment to think about the subject that way.
It is time for editors to treat climate policy as a permanent, important beat: tracking a mobilization for the moral equivalent of war.
Pooley is one of the few major journalists in the country who understands that global warming is the story of the century — and if we don’t reverse our emissions path soon, it will tragically be the story of the millennium, with irreversible impacts lasting for many, many centuries (see “ Hadley Center: Catastrophic 5-7°C warming by 2100 on current emissions path “).
In a conversation Saturday, Pooley told me, “I think this is the only story going forward.” That’s why, although he remains a contributor to Time magazine, he is devoting most of his time now to researching and writing a book on the politics and economics of climate change.
He decided to examine media coverage surrounding the 2008 Senate debate over the climate bill put forward by John Warner (R-VA) and Joseph Lieberman (?
?-CT):
News coverage of the Lieberman-Warner debate included some shoddy, one-sided reporting and some strong work that took the time both to dive into the policy weeds–evaluating the economic assumptions used by the various players–and step back to portray those players as com-batants in a war for public opinion.
But most of the reporting was bad in the painstakingly balanced way of so much daily journalism–two sides, no real meat.
The media’s collective decision to play the stenographer role actually helped opponents of climate action stifle progress.
Mainstream news organizations have accepted the conclusions of the IPCC but have not yet applied those conclusions to the economic debate.
The terms of that debate have been defined by opponents of climate action who argue that reducing emissions would “cost too much.” So the battle has been fought over the short-term price of climate action and its impact on GDP, while overlooking an extremely important variable, the long-term costs of inaction and business as usual.
That means when the media goes out looking for a well-known climate economist to quote in an article, they typically end up with someone who doesn’t understand the scientific urgency and those who misunderstand the economics [more on that in Parts 5, 6, and 7 of the series].
Pooley’s whole paper is a must read, especially for advocates of climate action.
Yes, the media bears much culpability for the fact that, as Pooley says, “the tipping point for climate action has not yet been reached.” But so do scientists, environmentalists, and progressives.
The general state of our messaging remains lousy (see, for instance, Part 4: The idiocy of crowds or, rather, the idiocy of (crowded) debates and Does the “Reality Campaign” need new Mad Men?
One clear message from this study is that the climate science activists need to do a better job of spelling out the cost of inaction.
Until that cost is clear to the public, the media, and policymakers, the country will never be able to mobilize to do what is needed to preserve a livable climate.

Note that the best climate journalism appears on the Internet.
Possibly because broadcast and dead-tree-based media are carbon intensive and heavily subsidized by carbon products (advertising).
Unless big corporate media grows up quick – they will lose all trust and loyalty.
The time is about right for a video based climate news site that summarizes and links to ClimateProgress and RealClimate and other pressing stories of each day.
And while I readily admit I won’t be “happy” until the NYTimes has a daily section devoted to Climate Change – preferably between International and National – my god the Times’ coverage is crap – I think Dot Earth does more damage than good ghettoizing the subject…not to mention that Andy R. has done far too much stenography over the years.
I wonder if, as I do, Mr. Pooley sees the WaPo’s coverage of climate change leaps-and-bounds above the NYTimes coverage?
I’m a semi-retired journalist who has felt, almost from the beginnings of the climate story a generation ago, that the print media’s performance has been terrible.
There are always excuses, of course: deadline pressure, space, budget.
But even though those constraints exist, a much, much better job needs to be done.
Your readers might be interested in a recent booklet called Communicating on Climate Change: An Essential Resource for Journalists, Scientists and Educators.
It’s by Bud Ward, and is the result of a series of workshops he held under the aegis of the Metcalf Institute for Marine and Environmental Reporting at U of Rhode Island.
If anything, the WaPo is even more clueless than NYTi.
They have continued carving science coverage back to the point that it’s only a half page once a week, and even than it’s frequently on marginal topics.
The one reporter who was assigned to climate topics was pulled back to political coverage last year when most of the best political talent fled to Politico.
I can vouch from personal experience that WaPo management strongly objected to climate science coverage more than once a week on a blog devoted to weather(!
), and they banned policy coverage altogether, rendering my continued participation totally untenable.
As for Revkin, his coverage seems to be mostly about him.
I attended a presentation he gave last year as part of a seminar series on climate change, and it was all, “Here’s a picture of me at the North Pole, and here’s an article I wrote 20 years ago, and oh yeah, here’s my book for kids, too.”

The credit union problems happened in the recent past.
We should have known what the government regulations did for us and what happens when the regulations aren’t there any more.
It was a problem more easily understood and visible than global warming caused by greenhouse gases being emitted by Humans machines and land use.
And we still made the mistakes of the past.
How much of a chance do we have to avoid something like Human caused global warming which humans have never been thru before?
Even if we go thru 6 degrees celsius increases, there would be a percentage of Humans who said it was all natural causes which Humans can’t affect anyway.
We try to blame some professional group for not doing enough to sound the global warming alarm, but we haven’t done so well with even more obvious, more visible problems.
It may be just part of the human condition.
One of the things that make people notice something is the amount of time they spend on it.
Most humans just don’t spend any time on it.
What I said about newspapers I believe applies equally to the legacy TV networks and the cable news networks as well: “When a threat is as catastrophic and imminent as global climate change is, then newspapers have the responsibility to fulfill their Paul Revere role and proclaim loud and wide that “The British are coming!
The British are coming!” and proclaim it until the message is delivered and people understand the most vital news of our time.
This is part of newspapers’ core duty and their trust to inform.”
With the newspaper and television news media failing their duty and trust with us I am incredibly appreciative for Joe Romm and Climate Progress because he and the others I read regularly – like Dr. James Hansen, Bill McKibben, Climate Ark, RealClimate, Grist, and so many others – have picked up the torch and ARE issuing the call.
They’re doing it on line and in face to face meetings/conferences/presentations around the world.
That being said, Joe is dead on right when he says we better have the right message and make it easy to grasp and simple to understand.
We need a Fighting Climate Change brand with a hook as strong and appealing as Apple Computers’.
The Reality Campaign is a sad marketing FAIL and an unfortunate waste of budget and airtime.
You some time think that these climate scientist and other notables just are not pushing the agenda to the extreme level required to convince the media and the public.
Eric’s paper is a very useful exploration of the incredibly tough terrain where journalism meets climate & energy policy and politics.
One update.
The Times has put John Broder in Washington on the beat fulltime (answering Eric’s call for an excellent political reporter in our mix).
[JR: I do not agree with what you have written Andy, and I do not disagree with Eric.
The only plausible choices for achieving 450 ppm (or better) are incredibly strong government regulations and/or a high carbon price.
So far, only the second is on the table politically.
Given the public's current state of understanding of climate, a fight over how to put a price on CO2 is a very reasonable thing to do.
Ideally, it wouldn't be "protracted.
" If it is, then it was even more necessary.
It is unrealistic to think that this can be done without a high CO2 price, as the recent IEA reports make crystal clear.
It is disappointing to see that our leaders are not getting it – look at all the money they have committed to try and kick start the old consumer base paradigm that got us in to this dilemma and which is relentlessly driving our CO2 upwards.
(Climate change envoy calls for state aid to create low-carbon economy)
If we don’t switch our bail out packages and infrastructure spending towards obtaining the target for 100% CO2 reduction.
then we are hosed for sure.
There won’t be a second chance.
We will have wasted the money, the political effort and the time (the oh so precious time) correcting the more urgent at the expense of the most essential.
(Climate change in 2009: the defining issue)
The quality of climate change coverage is inversely proportional to the amount of carbon-advertising next to it.
Dot Earth is one of the most prolific sources of climate change coverage in the major newspapers.
But it is often festooned with ads for luxury autos (hyper-carbon), world trotting travel (hyper-carbon) and sprawling showcase homes (hyper-carbon).
And i feel the coverage reflects that reality.
Few advertisers pay to support a voice saying their product is dangerous.
Until the newspapers develop sources of funding that aren’t hyper-carbon based we will not get climate change honesty from them.
I can think of several models for alternative funding for newspapers…or at least climate sections of newspapers…such as those used by educational institutions and even Obamalike-web-funding.
I think Andy underestimate the potential impact of a carbon price.
I’d argue that a well designed cap-and-trade system is likely to be the most powerful accelerator of clean energy technologies.
Not the only thing we need, by any means — certainly we need a suite of solutions, including RPS and phased-in performance standards for coal-fired power plants, and certainly we need to ask hard questions about the total mix of action and investments.
(My paper’s focus on cap and trade wasn’t meant to imply that those things aren’t also important.
) But putting a price on carbon — including a price floor — will harness a level of private investment far beyond anything the federal government itself can spend.
It will generate a great deal of money for R&D and a consumer energy-price cushion.
And a mandatory declining cap on emissions is the way to ensure that GHG pollution actually gets cut — a carbon tax won’t do that.
There’s reason to be skeptical of Washington’s ability to produce a good bill.
But here’s another way of looking at this: Why has the path to legislation been painful and protracted?
Because this really does matter.
Certainly the fossil fuel interests believe it does, otherwise they wouldn’t be going after it hammer and tongs.
Why spend $20 billion of taxpayer dollars on climate research and then not get the word out about all the dire consequences (climatescience.gov)?
I urge scientists in climate and related disciplines to make the effort to write to media outlets every time they get things wrong.
Flood their mailbags with demands for corrections!
Do it on the stationary of your scientific institution.
Use the credentials and affiliations that you have.
Consider it part of a wider effort to educate.
A letter from a layperson like me is easily dismissed, especially if they are getting a lot of letters of support from climate science deniers, but from the heads of faculties and from senior scientists at climate relevant institutions, most editors will at least read them and be much more likely to publish them.
At best they will be made more aware of how far from reality some of the garbage they publish really is, at worst they may publish such letters in order to perpetuate controversy and consequently attract some readers – but still publish them.
Don’t let silence by scientists on misrepresentations of science be counted as some kind of agreement.
In trying to get people to adopt a diet more in line with the 21st century and oncoming climate-related agriculture troubles, shouldn’t we be using language that doesn’t glorify meat?
There are dozens of different words that could have indicated a lack of profundity or substance, ‘profundity’ and ’substance’ being 2.
And I can agree, too, that many media outlets failed; but others did not.
I wrote one of the first national magazine articles on global warming for Discover magazine back in 1986, and there was then, and has been since, solid and consistent reporting by numerous journalists in print, radio, and television, in local, regional, national, and international markets that has looked intelligently and comprehensively at the debates–scientific, political, and economic–about the issue.
I get a bit weary, at this late date in the world’s history, of people–yes, even people within the media–engaging in reification.
The media is not a unitary phenomenon.
If we had to identify one principle cause for the distortion of scientific opinion regarding global warming in the last decade, we could be fairly safe in looking one place: the Bush administration, viz.
the Waxman report.
http://www.climatesciencewatch.org/ index.php/ csw/ details/ house_oversight_report/ Of course, if we were trying to understand the complex response to a complex phenomenon, we’d look, with greater particularity, far beyond.
The Environmental Protection Agency raised the bar for mountaintop mining today with a proposal to stop or at least significantly restrict one of Appalachia’s largest and most disputed mining operations, the Spruce No.
1 mine in Logan County, W.Va.
While the Corps has the authority to approve mining permits, EPA has veto power when it reviews environmental impact statements, and that’s what it is proposing to use now.
It has used that authority only 12 times and never before for an already permitted mine like Spruce No.
1.
“Coal, and coal mining, is part of our nation’s energy future, and for that reason EPA has made repeated efforts to foster dialogue and find a responsible path forward.
But we must prevent the significant and irreversible damage that comes from mining pollution — and the damage from this project would be irreversible,” Garvin said.
“EPA has a duty under the law to protect water quality and safeguard the people who rely on these waters for drinking, fishing and swimming.”
In the proposed determination released today, Garvin wrote: “EPA believes that the predicted impacts from the Spruce No.
1 mine, if constructed as currently authorized, could have unacceptable effects on wildlife and fisheries.
" He talked about the degradation of water from mining debris that is dumped into streams with unearthed metals and elements, such as selenium, which can cause birth defects in fish.
The dumping of mining debris in streams also destroys habitat relied upon by the region's salamanders, fish and smaller creatures, such as insects that are key elements in the food chain for birds, bats and other animals, he wrote.
And pollutions would become a problem downstream from the valley fills and could contribute to conditions that support golden algae blooms, which release more toxins dangerous to aquatic life.
There is a cumulative impact that needs to be considered, he said.
This is a region of West Virginia where state officials, in a 1997 assessment , identified as a priority the need to “locate and protect the few remaining high-quality streams.” The Coal River sub-basin has had more than 257 past and present mining permits, collectively occupying some 13 percent of the land, according to the EPA.
At the same time, the area has about 51 species listed as endangered, threatened or state rear species, and many of them rely on aquatic ecosystems for their lifecycle.
“The streams that will be buried cannot be viewed in a vacuum,” Garvin wrote.
“When those streams and wildlife are buried, there will be effects to downstream waters and downstream wildlife caused by the removal of functions performed by the buried resources and by transformation of the buried areas into source that may contribute pollutants to downstream waters.”
Arch Coal issued a statement saying it was "disappointed that EPA has chosen to take the unprecedented action to initiate the veto process under Section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act against a validly issued and existing permit.
The Spruce permit is the most scrutinized and fully considered permit in West Virginia’s history.
The 13-year permitting process included the preparation of a full environmental impact statement, the only permit in the eastern coal fields to ever undergo such review.
"
In EPA’s view, the initial environmental impact statement contained too little detail about the impact on streams, though, so it ordered a new assessment.
In the revised environmental impact statement in 2006, the mining company cut the project's impacts to 2,278 acres and 7.48 miles of streams.
About 110 million cubic yards of former mountaintops, rock and unearthed elements would be dumped into streams over 15 years, according to the EPA.
Garvin's explanation of the problems with Spruce No.
1 went farther than usual, also mentioning the effects of deforestation on terrestrial wildlife, including the fragmenting of their habitat.
And he said that EPA was concerned that environmental justice issues were not being adequately addressed.
This is an area EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson has stressed.
In the case of Logan County, Garvin noted that the per capita income is roughly half the national average, and 24 percent of residents live below the poverty line.
These are the people who would be facing blasting zones, contaminated freshwater, truck traffic and dust, he said.
“The science is clear that mountaintop removal is harming water resources in real and measurable ways.
We hope that the Spruce Mine veto is a sign that EPA is going to begin using its full authority to stop this devastating practice.

The coal companies have devised a very effective plan to level West Virginia by blowing up mountains and extracting fossil fuels from the residue.
Over decades, the companies very smartly bought up the coal land and turning the state into depending on one industry, coal mining.
And, along with the industry came the Bull S**T PR to make the citizens think it was in their best interest to enter the ground and die from lung diseases to support their families.
[FPA Q1] In your book, “Diet for a Hot Planet”, you describe seven principles for a climate friendly diet.
What are they and are they something that everyone can apply to their daily lives?
Cut Out Food Waste.
In the United States, 25 to 50 percent of all food that could be eaten never even makes it to our plates.
A typical restaurant, for instance, wastes between 40 and 50 percent of its food.
This food waste adds up big-time to landfills, another way the food has a climate impact.
Send Packaging Packing.
Every year, Americans toss out as many as forty billion plastic water bottles , roughly 130 bottles for every single one of us.
Our food and drink’s paper and plastic, cardboard and bottles, cans and Styrofoam play a starring role in the impact the food system has upon global warming, from the emissions related to the production of packaging to those from the landfills which are clogged with their waste.
Got to get ourselves back to the kitchen.
The best way to bring climate-friendly fare into your life is to reclaim your own power to cook, grow, and create your own food.
[FPA Q2] In the current economic climate, is there a way to eat sustainable and climate friendly food at a reasonable cost?
[AL] Definitely.
Following most of the seven principles of a climate-friendly diet would mean saving money, not spending more of it.
Let me offer a few examples:
This skewed subsidy system helps to ensure that it makes financial sense for farmers to pursue commodities and chemical farming, not agroecological practices and biodiverse production.
Environmentally friendly practices certainly could be economical, but that would require getting our agricultural policy in line with our stated commitments to help address global warming and improve the environment.
[FPA Q4] Have policymakers in Washington or in other countries done enough to address the relationship between the food we eat and climate change?
[AL] Unfortunately, policy makers in Washington have been dragging their feet on taking serious action on climate change, let alone the connection between the climate crisis and the food chain.
Worse, what farm-state representatives succeeded in getting written into the stalled climate-legislation, Waxman-Markey, was actually exemption from emissions regulations for agribusiness as well as a continuation of business-as-usual for corn-based ethanol production level mandates, despite the solid evidence that this ethanol production leads to overall emissions increase, not reduction.

Pachauri, “Global Warming – The impact of meat production and consumption on climate change”.
The USDA has slightly different figures, claiming at least half of all corn and 80 percent of soy is now diverted from human consumption to the livestock industry.
United States Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service, “Feed Grains Database: Yearbook Tables.”
On August 5th, Russia’s prime minister, Vladimir Putin, announced a ban on grain exports after more than a third of Russia’s cultivable land was destroyed by a dreadful drought, caused by wild fires.
Putin has suggested that Russia’s ban on exports could extend into 2011 as the damage to this summer’s grain output may reach nearly 40%.
Recent studies undertaken by the University of Illinois state that new methods of crop development must be adopted in response to climate change if grain production is to meet future demand.
Don Ort, a University of Illinois professor of crop sciences and USDA/ARS scientist argues that “global change is happening so quickly that its impact on agriculture is taking the world by surprise.”
The University of Illinois’ Free Air Concentration Enrichment (FACE) facility, soyFACE, gives researchers the opportunity to create predicted future environments in an open-field setting.
Although elevated levels of carbon dioxide have been proven to increase crop yields, they are only increased by half of what was expected and half of what the United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change used in their model predictions regarding the world’s food supply in 2050.
Elevated levels of carbon dioxide also affect other climate change factors such as precipitation patterns.
Ort states that “by 2050, rainfall during the Midwest [United States] growing season is projected to drop by 30%.”
The University of Illinois has also researched the effect of elevated ozone levels upon crop yield.
Ultimately, Ort concludes that “how top-producing areas fare with climate change will be very important in determining global food security for the future.”
Happy “World Day to Combat Desertification” (WDCD) everyone!
It may not be a day on the calendar that everyone keeps exceedingly close tabs on, but a little more information couldn’t hurt.
Desertification is a process where land is slowly degraded due to certain human and environmental factors.
Occurring in dryland ecosystems that already have scarce water resources, it causes the land to become less and less able to function naturally and efficiently.
Today, it is one of the greatest challenges to the developing world.
Gradual loss of agricultural productivity due to overuse and other unsustainable practices is the primary cause of famine and malnutrition in Africa and Asia.
Population growth and climate change also play a role, as they add further pressure to land already used in unsustainable ways.
Celebrated every June 17th since the ratification of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) in 1994, the WDCD has been used to raise awareness for this important issue.
As this is also the Global Year of Biodiversity, the theme of this year’s celebration is on the value of soil diversity.
In the words of the UNCCD :
“Soil organisms contribute a wide range of essential services for the sustainable functioning of all ecosystems.
They are the primary driving agents of nutrient cycling, regulating the dynamics of soil organic matter, soil carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emission.
They also modify the soil’s physical structure and water regimes, enhancing the amount and efficiency of nutrient acquisition by the vegetation, and of plant health.
The diversity of ecosystems is also based on soil diversity.
In this regard, the conservation of soils amounts to preserving the basis for diversity of life.”
The drought has sapped water supplies for drinking and irrigation.
Wines reports that struggling farmers are moving to cities for jobs, selling livestock and borrowing money to take care of their families.
The Chinese government, however, claims, “…that its impact [of the drought] on inflation and food supplies is expected to be minimal,” and has launched plans to counter its effects.
How much have man-made activities contributed to the drought?
China’s neighbors are questioning China’s extensive network of dams on the Mekong River and their impact on this vital waterway.
Environmentalists point fingers at the planting of water-intensive crops and rapid industrialization as a cause of long-term depletion of the water table.
Meanwhile, Wines reports that the drought conditions are expected to break sometime in May, which may be too late for this season’s crops.
According to Xinhua, “The [meeting's] declaration…said the ministers have defined the four major areas of BRIC’s agricultural cooperation …[to include] establishing the information exchange system, sharing experience on agriculture and food stock, reducing impact of climate change on agriculture, and developing agricultural technology and innovation.”
Another major focus of the blog was food safety in the United States.
After several high profile cases of contamination of peanuts and pistachios (by salmonella) and even Nestlé’s Toll House cookie dough, which had batches contaminated by E. Coli, the Obama administration took several steps to address the food safety.
The appointment of a new Food and Drug Administration Commissioner, the convening of a Food Safety Working Group and a new clearinghouse for information, www.foodsafety.gov are positive steps, whose true results will take time to measure.
Growth is also thwarted by weather events like droughts or intense storms, such as monsoons.
2010 is projected to be warmer than average - the weather system El Niño is expected to last until May, bringing with it warmer air and water temperatures.
Irregular and/or protracted weather patterns may make for inhospitable environments for food growth.
Meeting in Barcelona this week to flesh out details of the looming Copenhagen climate summit in December 2009, negotiators and participants must also taken into account the scientific reports showing unmistakable changes and concerns over water conservation measures, and consequent relocation of sizeable populations.
In Saudi Arabia, for example, deep aquifers have allowed for complete self-sufficiency in terms of national grain production for a number of years.
However, the same aquifers are now being drained, say Saudi authorities.
By 2016, the country is expected to halt grain farming and become entirely dependent on grain imports in order to sustain its burgeoning population of 30 million, according to Lester Brown, president of the Earth Policy Institute .
Underdeveloped countries like Bangladesh and Vietnam seem to be especially susceptible to threats to the food supply brought on by climate change.
The article quotes Lester Brown as saying that there are climate models that predict sea levels to rise one meter by the end of the century, flooding half the rice fields in both countries and wiping out food supplies to millions.
Some analysts say that two ways to alleviate these problems would be through population control measures and a “’rethink [of] the entire food system’ in the same way the world’s economic and energy systems are being debated as a result of climate change.”
Plant scientist Dr. Gebisa Ejeta was awarded the 2009 World Food Prize for his development of drought resistant sorghum seeds, which have helped African farmers increase their crop yield .
The $250,000 prize is awarded each year by the World Food Prize Foundation, which was established by Norman Borlaug, known as the “Father of the Green Revolution.”
When President Barack Obama greets representatives from the world’s largest developed and developing economies later this month in Washington, D.C, as part of his administration’s reengagement with the rest of world to find solutions to global warming, expect him to argue in clear terms that a concerted, worldwide solution is required.
U.S. action on climate change is obviously urgent after years of neglect by the Bush administration, but Obama’s energy team knows that an international agreement with binding commitments from all major emitters of greenhouse gases remains the best means to meet the twin challenges of boosting global economic prosperity and protecting our planet.
Persuading our trading partners around the world to sign onto a global accord to limit greenhouse gas emissions is a central component of the administration’s foreign policy.
An international agreement is within reach through the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate processes.
In the meantime, the U.S. Congress has to move forward with an energy bill to build the competitive and innovative U.S. clean-energy economy that Obama and the congressional leadership promised during the election campaign last year.
That process began early last week when House Energy and Commerce Chair Henry Waxman (D-CA) and Energy and Environment Subcommittee Chair Ed Markey (D-MA) released a draft energy and climate bill that would boost renewable energy, increase efficiency, and reduce pollution.
The proposed legislation also presents a new plan to deal with the thorny but critical issue of maintaining U.S. manufacturing competitiveness in energy-intensive industries in a low-carbon global economy.
These initial legislative efforts are designed to ensure our workers do not suffer when we as a country take the necessary action to confront climate change, but other nations do not.
Make no mistake: The United States must act on its own, and as part of any global agreement.
As the world’s largest historical greenhouse gas emitter, we must take the necessary steps to commit to binding greenhouse gas reductions.
At the same time, the United States must recognize and embrace the competitive advantage inherent in taking action on climate change.
Limiting greenhouse gas emissions will enhance U.S. competitiveness. A carbon cap-and-trade program will reduce emissions and send a predictable price signal on carbon, which in turn will spur major investment in energy efficient and low-carbon technologies, foster innovation and upgrades, and create jobs and export led growth in clean energy technology.
In the absence of an international climate change agreement, rebates are the preferred means to tackle international competitiveness issues here at home.
But, in the unlikely event that the rebate provisions are determined to be ineffective, then the proposed legislation authorizes the president to implement a so-called “border adjustment” program, under which importers of greenhouse gas-intensive goods from nations that fail to police adequately their own industries’ carbon emissions would be required to submit carbon emission allowances purchased from a newly-established international reserve allowance system to cover their imported products’ carbon content.
The U.S. government would set up this new international reserve system, and if a carbon allowance is not submitted then these imports could be prohibited from entry into the U.S. marketplace.
Of course, the invalidation of U.S. climate policy by the WTO would be a major setback for the global climate, international climate negotiations, and for the global trading system, and must be avoided by all concerned.
Overall, an international agreement with binding limits on greenhouse gas emissions and other cooperative efforts are the best means to address U.S. manufacturing competitiveness in a global, low-carbon economy.
Furthermore, an international agreement is the most effective means to address carbon leakage and WTO compliance concerns and should be the primary course of action by the United States and other major emitting nations as they sort out how to ensure a fair, equitable global climate change program.
Working together, the Obama administration and Congress can and should improve upon these rebate and border adjustments provisions in the draft energy legislation now before Congress.
The current proposal is a constructive effort that must be built upon and refined, but it provides a path forward to address legitimate competitiveness issues while allowing the United States to take bold action to confront climate change at home and abroad alongside our major trading partners.
“...a valuable aggregator of views on one of the prime challenges of our time - how to provide the energy required to foster a smooth path beyond 'peak us' while cutting the risks of economic turmoil, resource conflicts or disruptive climate change.

Environmental policy can, unfortunately, be used to pursue many economic and social goals tangential to the primary aim of improving environmental quality.
A recent protectionist example is highlighted in a recent TEC post from the Center for American Progress :
The current proposal is a constructive effort that must be built upon and refined, but it provides a path forward to address legitimate competitiveness issues while allowing the United States to take bold action to confront climate change at home and abroad alongside our major trading partners.
In theory, lax environmental regulation can also be a source of comparative advantage.
Suppose the
imposes stringent air and water quality regulations that increase the cost of production goods and services domestically.
The relative cost of producing the same goods and services in foreign countries would fall and we might expect an increase in imports from countries with lax environmental standards.
In order to make the competition for consumers more fair, regulated business firms that compete with unregulated firms in other countries often (i.e., always) seek subsidies from the government.
This paper examines empirically whether more stringent domestic environmental policies reduce the international competitiveness of environmentally sensitive goods (ESGs).
Our time series evidence indicates that there are no systematic changes in trade patterns of ESGs in the last three decades, despite the introduction of more stringent environmental regulations in most of the developed countries in the 1970s and 1980s.
…
Overall, the evidence we have reviewed suggests that … International differences in environmental regulatory stringency pose insufficient threats to U.S. industrial competitiveness to justify substantial cutbacks in domestic environmental regulations.
… policy makers should do what they can to establish environmental priorities and goals that are consistent with the real tradeoffs that are inevitably required by regulatory activities; that is, our environmental goals should be based on careful balancing of benefits and costs.
The implication of this research is that environmental policy in general and climate change policy in particular should not be used as an excuse to erect trade barriers.
Climate change policy should be implemented based on an examination of the environmental benefits and the environmental costs.
Other economic and social goals should be pursued outside of the climate change policy arena.
The "climate change policy arena" is, by definition, a GLOBAL arena.
The "environmental costs" of AGW cannot be avoided by national or regional action, no matter how stringent and/or well meaning.
There are no "environmental benefits" of national or regional carbon reductions, if "carbon leakage" to and carbon emissions growth in developing countries offset the carbon reductions in developed economies.

Taking Action on Climate Change: Last year saw historic progress in the fight against climate change, with a range of greenhouse gas reduction initiatives.
We must continue this critical effort and ensure compliance with the law.
We will continue to support the President and Congress in enacting clean energy and climate legislation.
Using the Clean Air Act, we will finalize our mobile source rules and provide a framework for continued improvements in that sector.
We will build on the success of ENERGY STAR to expand cost-saving energy conservation and efficiency programs.
And we will continue to develop common-sense solutions for reducing GHG emissions from large stationary sources like power plants.
In all of this, we must also recognize that climate change will affect other parts of our core mission, such as protecting air and water quality, and we must include those considerations in our future plans.
Improving Air Quality: American communities face serious health and environmental challenges from air pollution.
We have already proposed stronger ambient air quality standards for ozone, which will help millions of American breathe easier and live healthier.
Building on that, EPA will develop a comprehensive strategy for a cleaner and more efficient power sector, with strong but achievable emission reduction goals for SO2, NOx, mercury and other air toxics.
We will strengthen our ambient air quality standards for pollutants such as PM, SO2 and NO2 and will achieve additional reductions in air toxics from a range of industrial facilities.
Improved monitoring, permitting and enforcement will be critical building blocks for air quality improvement.
Assuring the Safety of Chemicals: One of my highest priorities is to make significant and long overdue progress in assuring the safety of chemicals in our products, our environment and our bodies.
Last year I announced principles for modernizing the Toxic Substances Control Act.
Separately, we are shifting EPA’s focus to address high-concern chemicals and filling data gaps on widely produced chemicals in commerce.
At the end of 2009, we released our first-ever chemical management plans for four groups of substances, and more plans are in the pipeline for 2010.
Using our streamlined Integrated Risk Information System, we will continue strong progress toward rigorous, peer-reviewed health assessments on dioxins, arsenic, formaldehyde, TCE and other substances of concern.
Protecting America’s Waters: America’s waterbodies are imperiled as never before.
Water quality and enforcement programs face complex challenges, from nutrient loadings and stormwater runoff, to invasive species and drinking water contaminants.
These challenges demand both traditional and innovative strategies.
We will continue comprehensive watershed protection programs for the Chesapeake Bay and Great Lakes.
We will initiate measures to address post-construction runoff, water quality impairment from surface mining, and stronger drinking water protection.
Recovery Act funding will expand construction of water infrastructure, and we will work with states to develop nutrient limits and launch an Urban Waters initiative.
We will also revamp enforcement strategies to achieve greater compliance across the board.
Building Strong State and Tribal Partnerships: States and tribal nations bear important responsibilities for the day-to-day mission of environmental protection, but declining tax revenues and fiscal challenges are pressuring state agencies and tribal governments to do more with fewer resources.
Strong partnerships and accountability are more important than ever.
EPA must do its part to support state and tribal capacity and, through strengthened oversight, ensure that programs are consistently delivered nationwide.
Where appropriate, we will use our own expertise and capacity to bolster state and tribal efforts.
